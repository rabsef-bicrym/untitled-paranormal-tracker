12: [Speaker A] Foreign. Good evening and welcome to Monsters Among Us. I'm your guide, Derek Hayes. It's great to have you aboard with us here this evening as we begin our long march through one of the most brutal of all months, January. But as cold as it might be outside, I have plenty of spooky stories here to help keep your blood pumping and your spine tingled. And tonight's collection consists of calls from all around the world in yet another international special. And like we do each and every other week, we're gonna dive right into it from the far off reaches of New Zealand. Please welcome Eli to tonight's program.
13: [Speaker D] Hey there, this is Eli and I am calling from Aotearoa, New Zealand, and I wanted to share an experience that I had when I was a very small child. So this would have happened around 92, 93, when I was three or four. These are some of the earliest memories I have. It's very vivid to me still, even, you know, 30 odd years later. So what would happen is when I was in bed and I would be awake when this happened, like sort of I'd already awoken. I wouldn't wake up to the experience more so I would awake and then the experience would happen. So I would wake up and I would turn my head to look into the room and these beings, I guess these apparitions would appear. There was always two of them. They were small, like low to the ground. And they were essentially, I guess, made out of light, like a white light that was brighter in the middle and sort of faded out around the edges of them. And the best way I can describe the shape is like the corner of a blanket. And not just in shape, but in some way. It was almost like it was fabric. Like they were made out of fabric that was made out of light. They didn't have features, there were no faces, there were no limbs. But there was a definite three points to them with the point at the top and then two at the bottom. Just like a triangle, like think of a comforter, a duvet. It was sort of like that, but I got the sense that it wasn't filled with anything like a sort of billowed out fabric corner, but made out of light. So they would be there and they would be sort of speaking directly into my brain, I suppose, and saying that they had something very important that they had to tell me. They had some very important information. And please don't be afraid because we have to tell you. Of course I would be very afraid. So I remember hiding under the blankets and after a little while I would peek out and they would be gone. So I can't say if this happened every night, but it happened a lot. And it didn't stop happening until we moved out of the house that we were in. So just before I turned five. And it honestly got to the point where it was happening so often that I almost wasn't scared anymore. But the thing is, I still did not want to talk to them. I didn't want to have anything to do with them. So they would appear, I would meet immediately, put the blanket over my head and then take it off and they would be gone. So it was almost like it became a signal for them to leave. Strange thing is, my sister slept in the same room with me and she was a bit older, she was around 7 or 8. But she was never awake when any of this happened. And to be honest, we did not have a great relationship as we got older. So it was never anything I bought up to her. Unfortunately, she's no longer with us, so it's not something I can ask her about now. I don't recall telling my mum any of this at the time. I think possibly just because as a very small child, I don't think I really had the language to explain what was happening. But I do remember telling her as I got older. And she told me that quite often she would hear footsteps up and down the hallway in the house and that there was one particular room that was sort of like a playroom. The door would be closed, no one would be in there. And she would hear sort of shuffling around and like, and very low voices as if there were people in there. So maybe the whole house was haunted. I don't know the history of the house. It was very old. The suburb that it was in is one of like the earliest in the country, really. The only other thing that happened to me personally in the house was I would also have a recurring dream. It was a very linear dream and I was an observer rather than a subject in the dream. It didn't seem related to these apparitions at all either, which is strange. But there we go. So were the two connected? Who would know? Thank you so much for having this podcast and giving people the chance to tell their stories and. Yeah, bye.

Is an emergency. Now our next international stop takes us to the British Isles and kicking off this collection is Gabe from Ireland.
17: [Speaker E] Hi Doug, my name's Gabe, calling from Ireland. So it was September, October time around 2003. It was a cool, dry evening. It was winter, so it was quite dark early here. So I was out with some friends heading home about 8:30pm and we just moved into a new house, new development area and to get a shortcut home I used to cut through the storage area where they used to store all the diggers and stuff and the equipment at night time. And as I was walking through it was just dead quiet and I got this eerie feel, dread and fear. I didn't know what it was so I continued to walk on. So nearly home. I turned the corner, kicking stones and as I looked up there was this huge cat standing about 20ft away, extremely still, just staring at me. This thing was huge, huge for a cat. It was about the size of a collie, sleek, black, the biggest green round eyes. In the dark they were like lanterns, just piercing, just straightforward. It looked about 50 kilos, maybe about 2 meters from nose to tail. It didn't make any noise. It lowered itself down slightly. One left paw was just ahead. It almost looked like it was about to pounce and I was absolutely terrified. I thought, don't run. If I run, it could chase. So I stood tall. I roared at it. I stamped the ground. This thing didn't budge. It started to take slow steps forward, so I decided to go backwards, start to step off slowly and I seen the fences of the houses so I thought I'm going to make a break for the fences. I hope it doesn't come after me. So I went back about three steps slowly and ran for the fence and hopped the fences ran straight through my back door, shouting to my mum and dad, like, there's this huge cat outside chasing me. And they were like, why is up, Gabe? You're full of rubbish. Like, what were you smoking? So no one believed me. This really, really annoyed me. No one believed me. I know this sounds bizarre. We live in Ireland. There's nothing bigger than a badger, domestically wild. So I was sitting at home doing my homework one night, it was about seven days later, and the area where they keep the diggers, they have security guards at night. And he come running out screaming from his hut that there was a large cat. And I was like, mom, I told you. He witnessed the cat, he said, huge dog that was eating his lunch at his bag, he said. So I decided. Then after telling the story to my wife and stuff, he decided to research it. And the stuff we find online was insane. Around that time, about three months before, there was two large cats, a panther and a puma, released about 70 kilometers from my hometown in a town called Bush Mills. They were killing livestock, pets. The government were called in. The USPCA had managed to track these animals till a small town called, but the animals got away. So these animals then obviously moved south towards my area. I live near the Mourn Mountains and stuff. You can search them online. Huge forested areas. There's loads of documents online. There's a site called Blather.net where people have reported them. The PSNI, the Police Service of Northern Ireland from 2009, the Freedom of Information Act. There is so many documented cases of the large puma and panther esque cats in our area and they're still being sighted today. As I said, when I moved in this area, our home was a new build. On our local paper, there was the front page. When the men laid concrete, a large cat had walked through the concrete and left the print. It was in the dying Democrat, so everybody said it. Loving podcast. Thank you very much. Cheers, Derek.
18: [Speaker A] Thank you, Gabe. Very wise of you not to run. Now, I realize that's the instinct, but it's almost always a bad idea to run when it comes to predators like that. Now, I don't know that it's super well known here in the United States, but the United Kingdom is an ABC hotbed. For some 50 years, reports have flooded in of large black beasts on the highlands and the moors of England, Ireland and even Scotland. Photos, videos, tracks, scat, DNA evidence and even scratch marks have all been recorded. Now the running theory over there is that in order to squall any panics, officials simply pretend that these creatures don't exist. Good luck telling folks like Gabe that. And having seen one of these things myself, I don't think I'm buying it either. Thank you again, Gabe for sharing the report.

Dana, welcome to the program.
19: [Speaker C] Hi Derek, this is Dana from Alabama. Even though I live in Alabama, this will be a story from when I lived in England. So it's been over 10 years now. I lived in England for three years to get my bachelor's degree. And while I lived there, I was on a student visa. So under a student visa, at least back then, you could work 20 hours per week while you were in school and you could work 40 hours while you were on breaks, like Christmas break, et cetera. And I had a job at a place called Office and it's a shoe store. And it was in York. I lived in York at the time. And it was the main floor three stories above it, and then a cellar basically below it with a door that I don't know how it was up to code. I mean, it was probably three feet tall to get into the cellar. And you know, it connected to the old, like aqueducts, that bar under York. I mean, York has so much history. It goes back to Romans and Vikings and all of this kind of stuff. So it's built on a ton of history. And I can remember no one ever wanted to go down to that cellar ever. But we kept like our wellies down there, like our rain boots, basically, things that were waterproof because it did get damp. It was not inflated. It was just a cellar in the streets of York. So I would always go down there just because I kind of liked being creeped out. And I never experienced anything down there. But I will say my one experience that I had in that store was on the second floor. Whenever we would go up to get shoes, we were constantly running up and down those stairs and on the second floor landing There was a comfy chair there, just one on the landing where people could sit and eat their lunch if they wanted to. And I was running up and my friend Claire was sitting on that chair. She had just taken a bite of her sandwich, which is very important. Her mouth was full. I could see that her mouth was full. And as I turn right to go into what we called the Converse Room, I went past the wall into the stockroom. And once I'm fully away from Claire, I hear her say something. I can't tell you what it was. I immediately just thought, oh, she said something. There's a wall between us now. So I just didn't hear her. I go in, I find the shoes that I need, I come back out and I'm like, hey, girl, what'd you say? Did you say something to me? And she was like, no, I was gonna ask you the same thing. Thing. And as she's saying this, she's like, her hand is over her mouth, she's still chewing and like she's eating. She could not have spoken as clearly as what I heard. Whatever it was speak. I can't tell you to this day what it said. I mean, it was so clear that it was just right in my ear, right like they were standing behind me. And she had the same experience. She thought it was just as close to her. We both thought each other had spoken. And, you know, that whole place was creepy. Even the very top floor, everyone would get like this feeling of vertigo. No one wanted to go up there alone. My shoes got thrown across the stock room once. I'm still not convinced whether or not that was a ghost or if it was someone playing a prank on me. Everyone says they did not play a prank on me, so they swear hand down. You know, I trust them to a certain extent, but, you know, all my friends that worked there had similar, just little one off experiences like that. But anyway, I just wanted to call in, keep it spooky. Thanks for all that. You do love the podcast.
20: [Speaker A] Thank you, Dana. Now, Dana hit the nail on the head. Humans have lived in the York area since 7,000 BC. That's nearly 10,000 years of human occupation. So I bet there are ghosts stacked on ghosts in a place like that. No matter how you boil it down, it's creepy stuff, Dana. And we appreciate you sharing that experience here with us tonight. All right, let's do one more call before we take our next break and venture to another part of the planet. So please welcome this anonymous caller out of Scotland.
21: [Speaker F] Hiya. I've been Threatening to do this for a while. So here we go. Hopefully you can understand what I'm saying. I met my wife at school when she was 17 and I was 18. We had been together for about nine months and we were going to have our first trip away as a couple. We were going a drive to Blackpool from Edinburgh. It's about three or four hours drive. We were going away for the weekend and to make things easy, my wife girlfriend at the time, stayed over at mine for the first time. Normally I would stay at hers. And nothing strange had ever happened before. Well, we went to bed early as we needed to leave the house about 4am in order to drive down. We were awoken by a very distinct knock on the door. Like a kind, you know, the sort of classic noise. And that was about 1:00am Figuring it was someone at the wrong door, I just ignored it. When it happened for a second time, my girlfriend suggested answer it in case it was an emergency or like parents or something. I told her I'd just leave it. And the knock happened for a third time, quickly followed by a loud bang. It sounded like the front door opening. You know how you know what your door sounds like. We counted the footsteps up the stairs to the top landing. I was sure someone was in the house. I watched as the handle on the door moved and the door swung open and there was no one there. No further footsteps were heard. I searched the entire house for the intruder. I'm sure that was there, but found no one. The front door was closed and locked. The street was deserted. I even went out in the street and walked up and down to see if there was anybody there. I thought it might have just been a drunk person or something, but nobody there at all. I went back up to bed to check on my my girlfriend Hayley. And she was fine, all cuddled up and half asleep. I couldn't understand how she could be so calm when we both clearly heard something come into the house and into her room. She laughed at me and told me to come back to bed as there was no one to find. I kinda argued that there must be someone somewhere and she needed to help me look. She sat up in the bed and said she would deal with it. I'm like, what do you mean deal with it? So she patted the beds next to her for me to sit down and when I did, she said, very funny. You got him. It's nice of you to visit, but this isn't our house, so you need to go home and I'll be back in a few days. With that, the bedroom door closed. We carried the footsteps back down the hall, the stairs, heard the front door bang and the distinct knock on the front door again. My girlfriend Hayley looked at me, smiled, and said, see, I told you there wasn't an intruder. She cuddled back in and was asleep in minutes the remainder of the night, not knowing what the hell had just happened. And that's what life is like with my creepy wife. Tuesday Bye.
22: [Speaker A] Thank you caller for ringing in. Clearly someone or something really wanted inside. Unsettling for sure. But if I'm honest caller, it's not as unsettling as your girl ordering whatever it was to stand down. But I guess as strange as that was, it was probably a good thing that she was there to get rid of it. Thank you again caller for sharing that unnerving tale.

24: [Speaker A] Hey spirits not sold in Virginia and North Carolina. Well gang, that was the effort from the uk, but up next we make our way to North America. Please welcome Jude out of Canada.
25: [Speaker G] Hi Derek and amongst hers. This is Jude. I'm calling from Vancouver island in British Columbia, Canada. It was recently the anniversary of my dad's death, December 10th and it's put me in mind of a strange thing that happened shortly after he died and so I thought I would call and share that story with you. The town that my dad used to live in is a really small town in Northern Ontario. There's only about a thousand people in town and there's not a whole lot to do there, especially in wintertime. So needless to say, when someone dies in town, it's kind of a community event. He was a pretty young guy when he died. He was only 56. And the way that he died was he had a massive heart attack while he was driving through town. His car actually crossed into oncoming traffic and he crashed into a snowbank in front of the local arena. So yeah, it was kind of a thing the way that he died. It was just a really strange experience for me because I was away in university in Vancouver at the time. I hadn't been home for quite a number of years. My sister had just given birth to her daughter 10 days beforehand. So it was just this really strange, bizarre experience coming home to my dad's funeral. The viewing took place off and on for two days before the funeral. And I remember it had snowed like crazy on the second day. But luckily my brother in law Mike had plowed my dad's driveway so that we could get all of the vehicles up to my dad's place. My parents are divorced and so it fell on my sister and I to kind of do most of the sort of meeting and greeting on those viewing days, you know, so those were long days for us. But I remember getting back to my dad's place the night before the funeral and his house was just cold and dark when we showed up. The fire in the wood stove had obviously gone out early in the afternoon and we were all tired. I remember watching my sister take the baby out of her car seat in the dining room and hearing her ask my brother in law Mike, hey, did you leave the lights on in the tractor? My dad's old international tractor was parked behind the house to make room for all the cars we were expecting the next day. And I remember Mike saying, what? And she said, the lights are on on the tractor. And he didn't say anything. He just turned around and went back outside. I credit my brother in law Mike for freaking us all out entirely because he's this big, no nonsense guy from Calgary. He doesn't pull any punches, he doesn't take any crap from anybody. And when he came back into the house, he was white as a sheet and completely tongue tied. And we all just kind of looked at him for a beat and then he said, I know those lights were off yesterday when I finished plowing the driveway. There's no footprints around that tractor. And he just looked expectantly at Us each in turn. And I think it was my mom who was the first one to speak. She said, well, you know, maybe there's some moisture on the wiring or something. And Mike turned and looked at her and he said, the lights are physically turned on. And he made this kind of twisting gesture with his wrist. And my sister asked him again, are you sure you turned them off yesterday? And he said, yes, because I never turned them on in the first place. He's like, I plowed the driveway during the day. I didn't turn the lights on. Besides, the battery in that thing would have been dead hours ago. It's an old battery. And we all just looked at each other and I remember hearing Mike's voice say into that cold, dark house, I think that's Wayne, my dad, trying to let us know that he's here and that he's okay. So, yeah, that's my story from my dad's death day. Thanks for letting me share it with you.
26: [Speaker A] Thanks, Jude. And we're sorry for your loss. But I guess you can take some comfort in knowing that he might have came back one last time to check in on everyone. At least that's how I like to look at it. Either way, we appreciate the entry and the touching tale. Now let's stay in Canada for this next one. Susie, welcome to the program.
27: [Speaker C] Hi, my name is Susie and I am from Canada. And about 12 years ago I bought a house in Barrie, Ontario. And it was a really, really old house. And apparently it was like a farmhouse for an apple orchard. So I moved in and I lived by myself and just my dog. The first night I went to sleep, I was woken up about 3am to a screaming baby. I don't have children and there was no reason that there was a baby screaming in my house. So I went back to sleep. And the next day I walked around the house and I just told the house, I'm here. I'm not here to bother you or disturb you. Let's just live together. And I never told anybody about that because it felt pretty strange. And then I decided about four years later to sell the house. But as I was moving out, my best friend and my boyfriend were helping me move. And they both said, basically at the same time, thank God you're getting out of here, it's haunted. And I said, what are you talking about? And they both described the exact same thing, that there was like this little orb that would go in and out and around my couch and go into different places. And I obviously never saw that. But these two People, they didn't know each other at all until the day of moving because one was from another country. But they both had the exact same experience in my house. So I don't know if it was the baby. But I did ask my neighbor when I was moving that day to come over and have a drink. And he said, well, at one point there was a swimming pool in your backyard and a 15 year old boy was being bullied and being beaten up and thrown in the pool and ended up on life support and eventually died unfortunately. And then they cemented the whole backyard and the grass over the pool. But at the same time, that's not what I heard with the baby screaming. It was like a baby, baby screaming. So anyways, that's my story. Thank you.
28: [Speaker A] Thanks, Susie Shivers. Now I don't have a baby either. No children at all in fact. So if I were to hear one crying in my home, I have no idea how I would react. Not calmly, I would imagine. Creepy stuff. We thank you again, Susie, for sharing. Well, folks, I have one more story from the Great White north. So please welcome the following anonymous caller.
29: [Speaker C] Hi, I'm calling on behalf of my friend. When I heard this story from him, my friend and I had to like really get it out of him. He was like too disturbed or upset to even tell it. But he eventually told us, we're all in our mid-30s now. But when this happened to him, he was nine years old and his brother was 11 or 12. This took place somewhere in Manitoba. They lived on a property where their backyard like went out to the forest and they had been camping in their backyard one night and they had gotten woken up by like a light. I don't know if it was a sound in combination with the light, but they came out of their tent and they had seen like a glowing light hovering. They said it wasn't too far away, maybe like 10ft away. And it was like egg shaped and it was glowing and it was kind of hovering towards them slowly. And he said the next thing they knew they were up in the air like paralyzed, being pulled towards this light. And he said he remembers looking at his brother and they were looking at each other just like terrified, unable to do anything. And they're being pulled towards this light. And the next thing he remembers, he said that they were inside the light, they were laying down, but they still couldn't move and they were looking at each other. He says he doesn't know how to explain it any other way, but they were just inside of this light. Now when him and his brother woke up the next day. They were in their bed inside their house. And they had asked their parents if they brought them in in the middle of the night. And the parents said no. So they had no recollection of how they got back in the house. But he asked his brother if he remembers all of that happening last night. And he did remember. And they were just so freaked out they wouldn't talk about it again for years. Like decades. And when my friend had told us the story, it was just to me and one of my other friends when we were hanging out one night and my other friend started to kind of like laugh and make fun of my friend for this story. And he's like, you got to be making this up. And my friend that told the story got really, really upset and was like mad that he had even told the story. But I just wanted to tell that because it's pretty freaky. And I hope you enjoy. Thank you.
30: [Speaker A] Thank you, caller. Incredible story and I really wish we could have heard it straight from the witness himself. But we're still thankful we got to hear it any way we could. And in this case, either the witness had researched dozens, if not hundreds of other alien abduction accounts, or these abductions are real and they all seem to be conducted in a similar manner. Because the story our caller just laid out for us sounds eerily similar to so many past abduction experiences that we've heard over the years. Frankly, the similarities are uncanny. So amazing stuff, caller, and we thank you again for the second hand tale.
31: [Speaker E] And Jim will explain all that. That's a dark teeth.

34: [Speaker A] 6Th Street A4. Reddit Deluxe, Verona.
35: [Speaker H] Got an accident.
36: [Speaker A] Right shoulder.
37: [Speaker F] 91 Westbound.
38: [Speaker A] Now then, let's venture back to Europe, this time to Scandinavia. And to initiate the trip, we begin in Denmark with Eska.
39: [Speaker F] Hi Derek. My name is Eskar. I'm with denmark and I'm 19. So my story begins at midnight. I have my own little house beside my parents house. I just fell asleep. I was super close. Well, I hear my front door opening. I hear someone come in. In my mind is my mom. I'm sleeping on a loft, so I can't really see if someone's standing in my living room. She's whispering something and I can't really hear what she's saying. But after the encounter, I think she's saying something like, I think she's asleep. So I asked my mom, what? No answer. Well, I'm fully awake now. I sit up in my bed. I seen something standing on a ladder to my loft. And I think to myself, why is my mom standing on the ladder? Do you know what does that? Well, I turn on the lights beside me and see the thing is gone. The thing is, there's not a ladder where the person was standing. So that means the person, or whatever the thing was has to be at least seven foot because I'm six foot two and I can only reach the top of the wall with my fingers. So yeah, that's it. I don't know what I saw. Maybe you have a theory. I have attached a photo of my room. I have sketched the thing I saw so you can take a look for yourself. Thank you for listening and have a good night.
40: [Speaker A] Thank you, Eska. That might be our first call from Denmark. If it's not, it is the first one in a long while. Not a place we hear from that often. But as for that entity that Eska experienced, I don't like what I heard one bit. The whispering alone is enough to send someone running. But the fact that this entity was towering in height is only icing on the cake. Now folks, to keep the Scandinavian scares coming, let us swing over to Sweden where Cody is waiting with the next entry.
41: [Speaker I] Hi Derek. My name is Cody. I am originally from the uk, but I've moved over to Sweden. I'm here to tell you my story about what happened when I was back in the uk. So this is going back quite many years now. Maybe when I was about 14, 15 years old, I was out with some friends. And this is in the area called Buckinghamshire. And we were visiting this old abandoned. It's a g health center. The best way to describe is like a small house, really, and it was down a small, really long back road and it was at the end of the back road. There was no houses around it. There was just lots of fields and a bit of a wooded area surrounding it. And this place has been abandoned for quite a while. I've been there previously with friends. A little bit boring. There's nothing in there. Kind of, you know, people have been there and they've wrecked it and whatnot. But this time I went with two of my friends and it was completely boarded up. People obviously knew that, you know, everyone's been inside of it. So they've put big steel kind of casings all around the windows and the doorway. So we were searching for about half an hour for a way to go in there and have a look about. But there was no way of getting in here, Derek. It was just completely sealed off. Every single entrance you can imagine is just sealed off. One of our friends had a phone call, so he decided to walk off away from the house and to get where the house is, there's a little wooden gate. So you climb over the small wooden gate and then you walk for maybe about a minute until you get to the house. And it's all overgrown around the house, but you can clearly walk around it. So he's walked away and he's behind some trees. He's quite far away to the distance where, you know, we can't hear him on the phone and whatever. So it was just me and my one other friend, you know, we still kind of wanted to get in, have a look about. So we were still somewhat looking around. So we went to the backside of the house again. So this is even further away from where the entrance to the house is and even further away from our friend. So we have the whole house, you know, a blocking where our friend is. We have a walkway and trees there as well. So there's almost no way that we'd be able to hear our friend unless he kind of shouts at the top of his lungs or anything like that. And then all of a sudden, me and my friend, we hear like a jack in the box. If you don't know the tune, you can obviously have a look, but go something like. And it'll keep doing that until obviously the jack in the Box jumps out. And me and my friend, we heard this sound faintly coming from inside of the building, inside of the house. And I mean, I'm getting chills now speaking about it, because it's just almost unexplainable. I mean, I'd love to hear what you have to say about it, but this tune was so faint, and you could hear it almost directly coming from inside of the building. And as I said, if this was our friend that was playing it, you know, he must have been either inside the building, which he wasn't, or he must have been so close for us to hear it. But maybe after about five seconds of hearing this, me and my friend looked at each other and our faces both dropped. And I think we both knew, like, this is not right. So we didn't actually say a word to each other. After we looked at each other, we sprinted past the house, we threw ourselves over this gate, and to our surprise, we saw our friend there, still on the phone. And he's, like, super shocked because we've just come sprinting over the gate and towards him. And he's like, what are you guys doing? And we're like, were you not just messing about with us? He's like, I'm on the phone. I've been on the phone. And, you know, he wouldn't have had the chance to have played this tune and then run away and, you know, got to the position where he was and, you know, maybe not being out of breath or anything like that, you know, it was almost, you know, impossible for him to have done this and made this sound come from inside the building and then run away to the position he was in. He was, like, super shocked and saying, oh, you know, I don't get it. What did you guys hear? So we found a YouTube video, and.
42: [Speaker A] Me and my friend were like, yeah.
43: [Speaker F] Yeah, that's the one.
44: [Speaker I] That's the one. Oh, my God. And, like, we were going crazy at the fact that we heard this. So faint, but yet so clear coming from inside this building that was so, so secure. And then we kind of all got a bit freaked out after that and decided to make a walk away from the building and back to where kind of the main roads were and more houses and civilization. It's super, super strange. I think about it a lot. But, yeah, absolutely. Love your podcast. You and all your team are absolutely amazing. Please keep on doing what you guys are doing. You make so many people happy. Thank you. Bye.
45: [Speaker A] Bye. Thank you, Cody. Well, folks, what do you think here? Is this a paranormal experience or did some squatters figure out the best human deterrent out there? The sinister sounds of a Jack in the box in the last place you'd ever want to hear one. Brilliant stuff, Cody, and we thank you again for sharing the call.

Please welcome Dieta to the program.
46: [Speaker J] Hi Derek, my name is Diete and I'm calling from Denmark.
47: [Speaker D] So.
48: [Speaker J] So my story is actually from my aunt, my mother's sister. She's a nurse in her early 60s and sometimes she works in the night shift at a care facility with overnight patients. A little while ago, she experienced something that has completely baffled everyone who works there. On one of her night shifts, she and another nurse were working together. There's a small staff room in the back building that only employees have access to. No patients ever go in there. It's just a small square room with a few windows and a fridge where they keep their lunches, and a single door that opens inward at some point during the night. My aunt went to grab her food from the fridge for her break, but when she tried to open the door, which you have to like push it into the room to open, the door wouldn't move more than about 4 inches. Something was blocking it from the inside. So she pushed harder and realized that the refrigerator itself had somehow been moved across the room and was now sitting directly in front of the door, blocking it completely. And this fridge is heavy. It's not something you can just slide around. It normally stands to the right of the room, several feet away from the door. Somehow it had been moved all the way over and positioned perfectly so that the door could only open a few centimeters. My aunt and her co worker had to use all their strength to push the door open just enough to squeeze inside. When they finally got in, they expected to find someone, maybe a patient, trying to hide or escape, but no one was in there. They were thinking that maybe a patient had broken into the room, maybe barricaded the door with the refrigerator, and then jumped out of the window, even though it was the second floor. So that would seem very unlikely. But when they entered the room, no one was in there. And all of the windows were closed from the inside. And nothing really looked disturbed except from the fridge. There wasn't even a sign that anyone could have entered or exited. And again, it was a restricted room and no patients had any reason to be there. They checked everything. The floor wasn't wet or slippery. The fridge wasn't malfunctioning. It was just moved Somehow. A few weeks after my aunt told me this story, she told me there was another part to the story because about a week or two later, another nurse went into that same room. And there's a mirror on the wall. And as she looked into the mirror, she saw a person standing behind her in the reflection. But when she turned around, no one was there. And this all happened in a fairly new building, not some old creaky hospital with like crooked floors or anything that would make the fridge slide. So there's no explanation. Like, it's just so creepy, I think. And nothing like this has ever happened before. Since my aunt isn't really someone who believes in the supernatural. I'm not from a religious family. She's not religious. In Denmark, people aren't super spiritual. But after that night, I think that she doesn't really know what to think and I don't know what to think about this story. So maybe you have an explanation or. I don't know. But thank you so much, Derek. I really love your podcast. Bye.
49: [Speaker A] Thank you, Dita. Now, I'd like to say that an earthquake small enough not to be noticed, but big enough to move a refrigerator struck Denmark. And that's how Dita's aunt found herself in that situation. I'd like to say that, but the truth is Denmark is not a place where earthquakes happen often. And to have one big enough to move a fridge, I think you're going to feel that disconcerting for sure. But we sure do appreciate the entry, Dita. So thank you again for ringing in. 23 minute delay stop and go traffic from the 15 two realities that are.

53: [Speaker A] Now moving on from Europe, we journey to the other side of the planet. Home of dingoes, drunk bears and didgeridoos. We're going down under and Josephine is here to get this leg started.
54: [Speaker C] Hi Josephine here from Australia. I've been listening to your podcast for quite some time and I absolutely love it, but I've never called in before, so this is my first. And to start off with, I wanted to back up someone else's story. I saw a very similar thing to a man who called in on season 12 episode episode two, which I was just listening to. He said that he saw some lights in the sky that he thought were UFOs, and what he described was exactly the same to what I had seen here in Queensland, Australia only about three weeks ago. I was outside at night, probably 8pm and I was just laying down watching the stars, watching satellites going past as I do quite often. So I know the difference between planes, helicopters, satellites and being in the outback. It's quite clear there's not a lot of light pollution. And I saw exactly what he saw. These lights that were not aircraft, they would zip across the sky and then at 90 degree angles they would change their direction and there are about three of them on that night. Anyway, have a great night. I love your podcast and I'll call back with a few more stories.
55: [Speaker A] Thank you Josephine. UFOs over Oz. You gotta love it. And I'd love to spend more time talking about them, but I have several more calls to get through here this evening, so unfortunately I have to line up the next one. So please welcome Josh to the program.
56: [Speaker D] Hi Derek, my name's Josh, I'm from Australia.
57: [Speaker F] I haven't really had many experiences, but one thing that I have had happen to me, which was just sort of.
58: [Speaker A] A kind of creepy thing, it definitely.
59: [Speaker F] Isn'T Something that can't be explained through normal things.
60: [Speaker A] It was just kind of weird.
61: [Speaker F] I was probably about 14, 15.
62: [Speaker A] I was lying in bed trying to get to sleep. It probably would have been about 9, 9:30 at night.
63: [Speaker F] And the TV in my bedroom just randomly switched on. The show that it switched onto was actually Dexter, and it was a scene where he was talking to somebody and.
64: [Speaker A] Describing how he enjoyed killing people and how it felt. And it really creeped me the hell out.
65: [Speaker F] I think either of those things on.
66: [Speaker D] Their own, like my TV randomly switching.
67: [Speaker F] On could just be an issue. If I switched on the TV and it happened to go on to that particular channel with that scene, it's a bit creepy, but, you know, I've just switched on the tv, whatever. But just those two things together was.
68: [Speaker A] Just really kind of creepy. And my remote wasn't under anything.
69: [Speaker F] Nothing could have pressed a button. The only thing that could have happened.
70: [Speaker D] Is there was some weird thing wrong.
71: [Speaker F] With the TV and it just randomly switched on. But again, that has never happened at all since. It was just a really strange incident.
72: [Speaker A] That happened and I've never really had.
73: [Speaker F] Anything like that happen again. But, yeah, have a good one. Thanks. Bye.
74: [Speaker A] Thank you, Josh. You know, I wish ghosts would automatically turn iPhones on as well. And when they do, I wish they would tune in directly to Monsters Among Us. That's the sort of thing that the band U2 did a dozen or so years ago, I think. Only they didn't need the help of any ghosts. They had big tech in their corner. But here at MAU we do not. So if you can share the show with anyone in your life, we ask that you please do so. Every new listener is a potential new call, so in the long run, you're only keeping the fun going by doing so. Now, gang. Next up, join me in welcoming Jack to the airwaves.
75: [Speaker F] G', day, Derek. My name's Jack, from Australia.
76: [Speaker H] Got a little story for you.
77: [Speaker F] That's when I was a lot younger, I was visiting my granddad, my mother's father, in a place up on the north coast.
78: [Speaker H] And I would have been maybe 10 at the time.
79: [Speaker F] The place was just known to be a bit weird. Like there were stories of a yeti around, which is like in Australia's version.
80: [Speaker H] Of Bigfoot, just a bit of suss area. Anyway, I was asleep one night and my sister, me and my mum were.
81: [Speaker F] All in the same room and there.
82: [Speaker H] Was the lounge room beside it, the.
83: [Speaker F] Lounge room in the middle of the.
84: [Speaker H] House, and all the bedrooms and bathroom were around it.
85: [Speaker F] Think of it as like a square. The middle is a living room. We're in one of the rooms and.
86: [Speaker H] I remember just looking in the direction of the door and seeing a light.
87: [Speaker F] Under it and thinking that was weird.
88: [Speaker H] But then I thought maybe my granddad.
89: [Speaker A] Was up watching TV late at night.
90: [Speaker F] He couldn't sleep or something. So I get up and I open.
91: [Speaker H] The door and in front of me.
92: [Speaker F] Maybe like a meter away, is this.
93: [Speaker H] Little figure, maybe three feet tall, like a meter. And I just remember its head being really pointy, like it was wearing a hat.
94: [Speaker F] But I couldn't see it super clearly because it had flashing lights on it.
95: [Speaker H] That were super bright. I kind of couldn't see behind them.
96: [Speaker F] They were so bright.
97: [Speaker H] I could see the outline of this little figure, like a pointy head, little body.
98: [Speaker F] It was like a mix between a.
99: [Speaker H] Robot and an elf. Anyway, so I just got really scared, shut the door, turned the light on.
100: [Speaker F] In the bedroom and this is what.
101: [Speaker H] Made it kind of like a core memory of mine.
102: [Speaker F] I just remember my mum getting super.
103: [Speaker H] Annoyed at me for turning the light.
104: [Speaker F] On and getting into trouble for it the next day, waking her up during the night.
105: [Speaker H] And I was just trying to explain.
106: [Speaker F] To what I saw. So we both went out and opened the door. Nothing was there obviously.
107: [Speaker H] But yeah, I just remember the time in the room. Like it felt like time had slowed down, like it was going at a different pace.
108: [Speaker F] It's like whatever that thing was, it.
109: [Speaker H] Was like distorting reality or something, you know, it's something that stuck with me my whole life.
110: [Speaker F] I haven't really told many people about it.
111: [Speaker H] I love what you do, mate. Came out the.
112: [Speaker F] Good work. They good.
113: [Speaker A] Thank you, Jack. Very reminiscent of a few other calls we shared recently, beginning with Robin's story. In one of the recent best of episodes, she was camping in California when a creature matching the same description tried to enter her tent. And over on season two, episode ten of Monsters Among Us Junior, we shared a story from Ingrid, also in the BMW, who saw a similar entity sitting atop her refrigerator. So this story makes three pointy headed entity reports. So I now have my eyes on it, whatever it is. Thank you again, Jack, for the wild experience and the additional data. Point now gang, for the final call of the evening. And I warn you, this one is equal parts unsettling and heartbreaking. Please welcome Branton from Australia.
114: [Speaker H] G', day, Derek. My name is Brenton, I'm from Australia. I mean, this happened, geez, back in the mid-90s. Now for years and years I thought it was the men in black. But with stories that I've heard from the podcast and all the rest of it, it doesn't seem to be like them at all. I was about six years old and I had this dog named Sting. Great dog. Him and me had this really good connection. I could always sleep on the end of my bed and all the rest of it always be together, would always be playing together. He'd always look after me. Anyway, there's this one particular morning I woke up would have been about 6, 6:30 in the morning. And the dog wasn't at the end of the bed. Right away I had this gut feeling that something wasn't right. I went searching for him around the house and didn't see him in his normal spots in his bed or on the couch in the parents room. We had this driveway that went down to the main road. So I ran down there and I see the Sting dog laying just outside the gate on the side of the road there. When I seen him, I didn't see anything around, nothing. I just saw the dog. I get to the gate, I jump on top of the gate to see what's going on and then I see a car driving off. It's just hitting my dog and it's driving off. Look back and I don't know what I was really looking at at the time. I was more worried about my dog. But when I'm looking at my dog, I see five men in black suits and hats and they're standing there in like a half arc around my dog. Every single one of them had a notepad and they're writing stuff down, like notepad and a pen. I was like, what the hell? Why aren't you helping my dog? One of them looked up at me like, you can see us kind of thing. Didn't say anything. He just put his head back down and started doing his thing. They looked like just normal people. I didn't feel any bad negative energy or anything like that. I just looked normal people. Just hiding her notepad. I looked around to make sure there's no other cars. There's no other cars in the area. You're on a main road and there was cars driving past, but there was no other cars parked on the side or anything where somebody got out or anything like that. So I had no idea where they came from. As I said, when I was running down the driveway, there was no one there. As I jumped on the fence, these five guys in black suits were there. Now this has all happened within a short period. I jumped back off the fence I've ran probably maybe 5 meters and I've turned back to have a look because I was going to go and go get my mum. As I've turned back to have a look, those five men in black suits were gone. I've always called them men in Black, but if it's not the real men in black, the way that they've been described, or anything like that, I've always wondered and thought, what if they're angelic creatures or angels writing down notes to collect my dog's soul when he passed away. It's baffled me for years. Can't think of anything that would describe what I actually saw that day. But yeah, Loving the podcast. Have a good one.
115: [Speaker A] Thank you, sir. What a tragic tale. And what an unusual tale as well. Who were those strange men? What did they want with your poor pup? How did they even know to be there? And honestly, how did the dog end up in the road to begin with? The questions I have surrounding this report are endless, but something tells me Brenton doesn't have any answers of his own either. And why should he? No part of any of this seems to make any sense, but it does give me chills. And it does remind me of the men in black and how they would behave strangely struggling to blend in with the rest of the human population. And I also feel like this report lends to the simulation theory. Perhaps these are the programmers of that world, or at least the avatars of those programmers, keeping tabs on the inner workings of this artificial environment. Or, you know, maybe this was some sort of cruel joke. Perhaps the men were coincidentally in the area when the accident took place. This was their attempt at humor. I tell you, I wish I knew and I wish I had answers for you, Brenton, but I don't. But what I do have is a huge thank you for sharing. And I think that thank you is big enough to extend to all of tonight's callers. And it might even be big enough to extend to everyone listening as well, because that's gonna do it for this one.
