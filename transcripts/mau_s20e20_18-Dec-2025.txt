5: [Speaker A] Good evening and welcome to Monsters of Among Us. I'm your guide, Derek Hayes. Howdy, friends. I know the holidays are nipping on our heels and we're all busier than any human should be, but I appreciate you taking a moment to join us here this evening. And I think you made the right choice because I have a great little program lined up for you here tonight and I'd list some of the topics, but that would ruin the surprise. So instead, just sit back and enjoy. We have plenty of terrifying tales to go around, beginning with this entry from John in the state of Ohio.
6: [Speaker B] Hey Derek, this is John in Antwerp, Ohio. Wanted to share a story that happened to me about a year ago, roughly April, May of last year. It was first thing in the morning, 7:30, taking off, going to work, and I'm driving from Antwerp, Ohio to Fort Wayne, Indiana, and there's a stretch of highway called 24. And as I was driving up this highway, you go over this overpass. And as I was coming up on top of this overpass, I look off into the sky and it's a bright blue, beautiful, beautiful day out. And you can see for miles in the sky. It's very flat in this part of the country. And I'm looking off into the left and I see this silver ball in the sky. And I was like, dumbfounded. I was like, what in the world is that thing? And I just looked at it and then I looked back at the road and then I looked back at it. I look back at the the road and then this silver ball, like, almost turned to a point where, if you can imagine having someone shine like a watch light in your eyes, like using the sun and shining that light in your eyes. It's almost like that silver sphere, like, shined its light into my eyes. I remember just blinking and then looking back at the road and then looking back to find where it was. It had vanished. It was gone. I didn't see it take off. I didn't see it move. I don't know if it went up. I don't know if it went somewhere else or over my head or something, but I didn't see it at that point. But it was this big silver sphere in the sky. And I was obviously, you know, dumbfounded by that experience. I'd never seen anything like that. But then, you know, listening to the show, I've heard, you know, multiple silver spheres or even black spheres in the sky. So very interesting story. Felt the urge to share it. Appreciate the show. Keep up the great work. Thanks.
7: [Speaker A] Thank you, John, for calling in. Now, like John said, we've heard this exact same experience from several listeners over the years, dare I say dozens of reports, and nearly all of them describe the exact same object, A silver ball a couple of feet in diameter, flying through the air. Now, folks, you keep reporting these things and I'll keep collecting those reports. And until the next silver sphere rolls in. We thank you again, John, for sharing the entry. Now, folks, let's run one more before our first stoppage of the evening. So please welcome Taylor out of Rhode Island.
8: [Speaker B] Hi, Derek. My name is Taylor. I live in Rhode Island. This story, I was about 10 years old at the time when this happened, and I'm 32 now. So it's stuck with me all these years, and I think about it from time to time. But I had a few weird encounters as a kid in the house that I grew up in. And I often didn't tell my family about them just because, you know, I was either scared or I would also try to rationalize or play them off kind of in order to calm myself down. I'll never forget one story in particular. I was at home alone, which happened often. My mom was a single mom, and I had an older brother, but he was a teenager at the time, and so he was out a lot with his friends or working or whatever. And I was in my bedroom. I was kind of potsing around and redecorating the space, which I often did. I was very creative and artistic kid. Anyways, I was in my room, and out of the corner of my eye, I saw a white humanoid figure run incredibly fast, like, impossibly fast past my bedroom door. But enough at a pace where I was able to, like, out of the corner of my eye, make out like a very clearly humanoid figure, which, the way the house was set up, my bedroom and my brother's bedroom were all the way at the end of the hall. There couldn't have been more than, like, three feet of space before reaching the wall at the end of my hallway. So there would have just been nowhere for this figure to go. And it was running so fast, it would have just plowed through the wall. And I screamed out loud. And I was so frightened that I called my mom at work, and she stayed on the phone with me. She worked down the street, and I knew she'd be coming home soon, so she stayed on the phone with me until she pulled in the driveway, which was, I think, the only time I really needed her to do that. When I was young, I was a very independent kid. I kind of had to be only having one parent in the house. So the experience stands out for that reason too, because I was so scared in that moment that I just sat on my bed facing my door for a good half hour while I was on the phone with her before she got home. And my mom was very rational and calm all the time, and she just focused on calming me down, which she was very good at. Anyway, so she gets home, I kind of calm down, and we go about the evening, but I was still a little shaken up by it. So the next day we find out from one of our neighbors that our elderly neighbor across the street, she was a very sweet older woman. She had passed away the day before. So the same day that I had seen the figure and she passed away in the home. And I remember being so freaked out by that because I immediately thought, oh, my God, I wonder if that was her. And I've often wondered if what I saw was her, like crossing over to the other side or if I saw her spirit or something like that. I have a few stories from that house, things that I saw growing up, but that one definitely stands out a little bit more than the others. Anyway, I love the show, absolutely love it. I've been listening to it non stop, so keep it up. Thank you.
9: [Speaker A] Thank you, Taylor. We appreciate you tuning in. And of course we appreciate the call as well. A pale figure outside her bedroom window. Now, if I'm honest here, the description that she gave matches a few different legendary creatures. The pale Crawler comes to mind. A pale, sinewy humanoid creature seen all over the east coast, but not so much inside suburban homes. Then there's the infamous grey alien, said to be similar in color, and some reports have them moving at exaggerated speeds. But you'd think the large bulbous head that these entities are well known for would have been included in Taylor's report. And of course, this pale figure could be the manifestation of a ghost or a spirit, maybe even of the elderly neighbor. As Taylor suggested. Whatever this thing was, I can imagine it would give anyone quite a scare. So we're sorry Taylor, that you had the experience, but we sure are glad that you told us all about it. Thank you again for ringing in. Now folks, it's time for a quick ad break, but when I come back, I have some missing time for you. Don't touch that dial.

10: [Speaker B] Towing landed on.
11: [Speaker A] You also F Now for that chunk of missing time that I promised you, please welcome Mitch out of the state of Texas. Hey Derek Cobal as well. My name is Mitch. I'm recording this in my house in Texas.
12: [Speaker B] So I'm gonna start with my first story.
13: [Speaker A] Just kind of comes off the heels of season 11, episode 19 with missing time. The caller had a experience that I actually had as well when I was younger.
14: [Speaker B] Didn't happen here in Texas, actually happened at my grandparents home in Massachusetts.
15: [Speaker A] I was about 6, 7 years old right before my family moved to Colorado.
16: [Speaker B] Which is why I was actually at.
17: [Speaker A] My grandparents house cause they were watching us while my parents were looking for a home.
18: [Speaker B] What happened was, is I went to bed one night.
19: [Speaker A] I knew it was dark.
20: [Speaker B] At one point I was awake just.
21: [Speaker A] Staring at the ceiling and it was like I blinked and it was morning. Like we're talking not like sun rising, but bright like sun coming through the window. And all that thermosting in was upstairs.
22: [Speaker B] Kind of on their second floor, almost a converted attic space. There was one window and I know.
23: [Speaker A] The first question you're going to ask is was there three identical men? And I can tell you, I don't know. I didn't get up to see because it was kind of one of those weird experiences, but wanted to share that.
24: [Speaker B] With you because apparently I'm not the only one that experienced that.
25: [Speaker A] And I appreciate the other caller calling.
26: [Speaker B] In because it jogged my memory.
27: [Speaker A] Love the show and keep it up.
28: [Speaker B] Thanks Dirk.
29: [Speaker A] Thank you Mitch. Well, there's an idea. Maybe all missing time is caused by these mirrored men. But not all experiencers of missing time see these entities directly. Perhaps just being in close proximity to this terrifying trio is enough to warp time. It's interesting stuff Mitch, and something we will definitely keep our ears open for going forward.

30: [Speaker B] Hi Derek, My name is Zio. I live in Washington State state now, but this story takes place in Central Coast California and it takes place in the early 2000s when I was about 15 years old. I lived with my dad and his fiance at the time. They got engaged very quickly and I really disliked her and we lived in this pretty amazing house. We didn't live there for very long, but I started to experience strange things in that house. And the first one was I lived in this room in the back of the house and it had French doors out onto a back patio. And one time I was in the bathroom that was just outside of my bedroom. And when I left my bedroom I know that the doors were closed. I almost never opened those French doors and I was in the bathroom and my bedroom door was open and my dad came home with our two rambunctious dogs and they went running through the house and into my room and then they didn't come back out of my room and my dad came running after them and was sort of shouting at me for leaving my French doors open. And I said I didn't. And that happened a few times. And then one night I was reading in bed and I just got this sense that someone was standing next to my bed pretty close to me. Not like intimidatingly close to me, but fairly close. And I just felt this presence and I didn't see anything. I looked up, I didn't see a figure, but I just felt this presence and I noted that I didn't feel scared. Like I knew someone was standing there looking at Me, but I didn't feel scared. And I somehow also knew that it was a man and that he was in his mid-30s. It was very strange to just know this. And sometime later I was at dinner with my dad and his fiance and we heard a door close in the house. It could have been the wind, who knows? But it prompted my dad's fiance to say, welcome, join us. She was very eccentric. And she turned to me and she said, oh, did you know we have a ghost? And I almost never talked to her, but I couldn't help myself because I was really excited. And I said, yeah, I do know that. But I didn't want to say anything about it. I wanted to hear what she had to say to see if we had a similar impression of this ghost. And she was telling me she had spent a few nights on the couch downstairs because she had a cough and she didn't want to wake my dad up. And. And we had these battery powered electric candles, like cheesy fake candles on the mantle. And the way that you would turn them on, you had to pick them up. And there was a little toggle switch on the bottom. And she woke up coughing. And one of them was on. And then she went back to sleep. And the next time she woke up coughing, a different one was on. And she said that she didn't feel scared, she felt a presence, but she felt like it was comforting, which is similar to how I had felt. So then I asked, do you think it's a man or a woman? And she said almost immediately, it's a man. And I said, how old do you think he is? And she said, 35. I have tried to look into it just recently, actually. I did track down the son of the people who owned it at the time. The previous owners are no longer living. The son was very amused that I was looking into this, but he didn't know anything about it. I was just trying to find out if maybe a man in his mid-30s died in that house before we lived there. But I haven't been able to find that information. I even called county records office. And anyway, if anyone has any ideas about how to find this kind of information, you can track me down on the Internet. I'm a musician. I have a website, Zeo Bookbinder. Z E O B O E k b I N-E-R.com you can pretty easily find me and message me if you have thoughts on how to find out if somebody died in that house that I lived in. I know the address. Really enjoying your show. Thank you.
31: [Speaker A] Thank you. Zio, what do you think here folks? A psychic connection of some sort or just an overactive imagination? Now, if it was the latter, it looks like Zio's stepmother had the exact same vivid imagination. Now you can go to dyedinhouse.com Zio, you have to pay for the report, but it sounds like it might be worth it in your situation. They can tell you if there was actually a death in the home. I'll link to the site in tonight's show notes. In the meantime, I hope someone gets you the info you're looking for and I hope you update us if you do get it. We appreciate the call. Zio, thanks again for calling in.

35: [Speaker A] I have him slotted for 2026 now. Up Next out of New England, please welcome tonight's anonymous caller.
36: [Speaker B] Hey Derek, this is Anonymous from New England. I recently discovered your podcast and on episode 13, season 14, a lady that was talking about a doubleganger individual. And this story takes place when I was in high school. I grew up in Puerto Rico and I went out with my friends. We went out to the city. It was at night and even though I was hanging out with my friends, I wasn't drinking that night and I wasn't a drinker really. Usually I was the Designated driver. And that night, we passed some bars where people used to hang out, and a girl stopped me, and she stopped me, said, hey, how are you? Don't you remember me? And I'm looking at her, completely clueless. I had no idea who she was. And she's looking at me like she really knows me. She's like, don't you remember me? We went to school together one summer, and she started saying, my whole life. Don't you remember we were friends and remember you like this guy? And she starts telling me my whole history. I'm looking at her and I'm thinking, I absolutely have no idea who you are. And she looks at me and she says, you don't remember me? And I'm looking at her and say, are you sure you're not confusing me with somebody else? And she says, my name is. And she told me where I was from, and she knew intimate details about my life. And I still had no idea who this woman was. And I am not a person that forgets people. This has never happened to me before. It has never happened to me since. So of course I'm looking at her and I'm saying, you don't even look familiar to me. Are you sure it's me that you are talking about? And my friends that were hanging out with me at the moment, they're looking at me like, are you sure you don't remember her? I was absolutely have no idea. Do you guys know her? And they're like, no, we don't know who she is. And she was so disappointed. She's looking at me, says, well, your hair is a little different, but I'm sure it's you. I mean, this is your name. This is where we went to school together. I was like, are you sure we went to school together? She's like, well, it was summer school, and I'm from a different school. I should have took summer school at your school. Like, I did not take summer school that year. She told me the year. I was like, that is not me. She's like, no, no, it is you. And this went on back and forth for a good 20 minutes until I told her, listen, I need to keep going because I'm hanging out with these friends, but I am so sorry if it was me. I don't remember you. And she seemed so disappointed because apparently she says that we were close to the point that I knew supposedly details about her, and I had no idea who she was, and we moved on. I mean, I went and hung out with my other friends, and as we're walking away from this girl that she looked completely confused and actually like I had embarrassed her. But she also looked disappointed, like she had lost a friend some sort. And my friend said that was. Are you being mean? Do you not remember her or you're just deciding not to know her? And I was like, no, I really don't know who she is. I have no idea who this girl is and has bothered me through years. To this day, I don't know who she is. I have no idea what she was talking about. But she knew details about my life. She knew about my family. She knew about boys that I liked at the school. She knew things that only a friend would have known. And I didn't have that many friends. I wasn't a popular kid. I wasn't like, I had 20 friends and I forgot somebody's name. I had maybe two or three friends. I would have never forgotten one friend because I wasn't the popular kid. I was just a kid that was just like in the. In between. Not really a loner, but not really a popular one. So this has always bothered me. And I heard this episode that you said, and I always wondered if this was a person that. Well, maybe she thought it was me and been impersonating me. Because it has happened to me before where people have stopped me and said, hey, I saw you here. I thought it was you, but then I noticed it wasn't really you. And I've gotten that a lot. I just wanted to share that story with you. I appreciate it. Thank you.
37: [Speaker A] Thank you, caller. You know, my first thought after hearing this story was that it was some sort of scam. Perhaps the person pretending to be your friend had some basic info on you but needed more or needed something specific like a mother's maiden name or something, and she was using this technique to probe for info. Of course, it's also possible that this mystery girl simply got her dates wrong and her caller here completely blanked on ever having met her. It's odd, however you want to slice it. I can't explain it, but I do. Thank you, caller, for taking the time to share. Now, folks, this next call takes us back to Ohio. Please welcome Anthony to the show.
38: [Speaker B] Hi, Derek, my name is Anthony. I'm from Ohio. And this story takes place in Coshocton County, Ohio, close to New Bedford. Actually. My family owns property down there. I'm 43. My whole life, I've been going down there till about 2011. Little disagreement happened and I haven't been there since except for a couple Times, but that's where I used to deer hunt and spend a lot of times in the woods as a kid. My friend, me and him from high school, we still hunt together. And it's a December night. If anyone hunts, knows gun season after Thanksgiving. And this particular winter, maybe.09 or 10. I don't really remember the way the family's property is set up on some acreage. There was a house and barn built in the late 1800s and they were owned by Amish. And then my grandfather bought it in 1962, I believe. And then there was a new addition put on in 81. And as it was, me and my friend were sitting in the basement. Simple ceramic stone foundation basement. We had free gas, so the gas was always on. It was always warm in there. You know, it was a lower level. You could walk right in the downstairs. And as it got darker there, no water, no electricity. It would just get dark. And it was snowing very hard. And, you know, me and him were always big on going out to deer hunt and no issues there. And we decided that day we weren't going to do it. We were going to have our beers downstairs before we went to get something to eat. We were just downstairs and I remember thinking in my head, I'm hearing this music coming from upstairs. It's like the 1920s music. I don't know how to describe it. Just that. Not really a twang, just that 1920s kind of music. And I'm hearing this upstairs and I don't say anything to him. I just think it's our radio upstairs. We always had a radio that would run off batteries and we would turn it on. You get some of the local stations and we go to leave and you know, it's pitch black. We got our flashlights as we're going upstairs. I said, dude, you leave the radio on? And he says, no, I didn't leave the radio on. I said, you didn't leave the radio on? He's like, no. I was like, I've been hearing this music, this old music, like as long as we've been down here just hanging out. And he's like, I didn't leave the radio on. And we both go upstairs and I walk right over to the radio and the radio is completely off. And I look at him. I was like, I was really hearing some strange music, like old music. And he looks at me, goes, I heard the same thing. But neither one of us had said anything about it, like to each other until that moment. And it was just very strange. And I'VE always remembered that to this day we still talk about how we heard that music and we never knew what it was and we just simply walked out the door, went to the bar and didn't say nothing else about it and then came back, went to bed and went deer hunting in the morning. Thanks Derek. Great show. Appreciate it.
39: [Speaker A] Thank you Anthony. You're dangerously close to where I grew up. Coshocton was a neighboring county and a fun town to take a field trip to. And as far as Ohio history goes, that area has some of the oldest European settlements in the state, an obvious location in which to encounter ghostly activity. Now, we're not able to hear the haunting music that Anthony detailed, but this is one of those rare paranormal phenomena that plays well over a podcast. So let's take this opportunity to Explore a few EVPs featuring the exact same thing that Anthony reported. Ghostly music beginning with an EVP captured at an old speakeasy. The following was recorded at 4:30am courtesy of SCPC Ghosts. Now this next clip is from an investigator named Tracy Hadsell and was recorded in February of 2007 during an investigation at Old Union Cemetery in DeWitt County, Illinois. And finally, this clip from an Ontario, Canada based investigation group called the Paranormal Seekers and was captured during a March 2017 investigation in Welland, Ontario. So like I said, we can't exactly hear what Anthony heard, but thanks to these EVPs we're getting pretty close. So thank you again Anthony for sharing the entry. That's the kind of thing that'll give you goosebumps.

43: [Speaker A] Now? Next up, we head back to Texas. Please welcome Tasha to the program.
44: [Speaker B] Hi, my name is Tasha and I'm calling from Texas. The event that occurred to me actually did not occur in Texas. This occurred in Randolph, Massachusetts. And I was up there on November 4th. It's Thursday, actually the fifth that it happened because it was early in the morning. I went to bed on Wednesday and I was actually at a friend's house. I was in the spare bedroom and I actually was sleeping on a blow up bed. This was already the third, fourth day that I was sleeping in that room. As soon as you turn off the lights, it's complete darkness. There's no light coming in from the windows, there's no nightlight. It's just complete darkness. And the two windows that are there are actually right next to the bed and they are covered with a velvet black curtain. So it's complete darkness. So that night I went to bed and I don't know why, but I had this odd. I wouldn't really say it was a nightmare just because of the fact that, I mean, I would think a nightmare would be more monsters, I suppose. But this dream basically was me yelling at either my dog or a kid, telling them not to go next to this person on the opposite side of a pool that has been drained. Basically there was this old man laughing and it wasn't a very creepy like smile or anything, but it was just overall odd. I didn't like it. And I'm yelling and yelling and I'm thinking that maybe I woke myself up from that yelling. Somehow I just woke myself up. I am laying on my side. As soon as I open my eyes, I just automatically lift up my head. There is no need for it. I could have just opened my eyes and closed it, but instead I just opened my eyes and just look straight at the corner of the room right next to me basically. And as I do so I see a face. Now I'm staring at this face for a while because I'm thinking, okay, I'm just like seeing things. As I start looking down, I start realizing, oh my gosh, this person is wearing clothes. So as soon as I had that realization that there's a man in my room, I screamed and you know, pulled the covers to my face and I started praying out loud. Now, normally I would think I wouldn't be scared, but I don't know. I just started praying. As soon as I finished my prayer, I felt brave enough to grab my phone, turn on the flashlight, scanning the room. Nothing was there. Now, this thing that I saw in the corner, his face, it looked like it was illuminated again. This room is complete darkness. And somehow I was able to see the details of his face as if there was kind of like a spotlight over his head. Well, anyways, I could see the face and I could see down and I could see that he's wearing kind of an older type shirt, kind of like a button down shirt with a kind of jacket or vest or something over it. So that's what really creeped me out. After I got up, standing in the room with my flashlight, I went running to wake up my friend. He checked their room to check the closet because I was like, there was somebody in my room. He's like, nobody's in here. Nobody can get in because his roommate is a cop. So there's no way anyone's gonna come in because they have like the whole house, like with cameras and everything. So I basically sat in my bed typing all this out so I wouldn't forget. And I looked at the time and the time was 2:58 when I looked at it. So it happened sometime between 250 and 258. Well, thanks for letting me share this story. Bye.
45: [Speaker A] Thanks, Tasha. Now, this is one of those encounters where sleep paralysis might be the best case scenario. Otherwise, we're either looking at an intruder of some sort or a genuine spirit, whatever those happen to be. Either way, it sounds like a scary situation to me, Tasha. And as a collector of those types of tales, I can't thank you enough for sharing. And folks, that brings us to tonight's somewhat final entry. And for this one, we venture back to Texas, and I believe this story actually occurred there. Please welcome Robin to the program.
46: [Speaker B] Hey, Monsters Among Us. This is Robin from Texas. This was probably 20 years ago. I was living in Burleson, Texas, and I had my horses sported out in Crowley, Texas, and I would travel twice a day to go see them and feed them and take care of them. It was often dark when I would come back at night, and I did see a lot of things in the sky because it was open and I was kind of paying attention to the sky. But on this one particular night, it was in the summer, I had my windows down. It was a warm night in Late July, it was probably 10 o' clock at night driving down 1187 Crowley Road. And all of a sudden I see this white, perfectly round orb fall from the top of the sky to the tree line, I don't know, a thousand feet in front of me at an incredible speed. And while I'm trying to process this, I'm at a four way stop and there's nobody except for one other person next to me that have pulled up to the stoplight. And when I'm processing this, all of a sudden these colors come up out of the forested area and they shoot straight up from the bottom of the tree line all the way to the top of the sky. And the only way I can describe it is if you took a glass of milk and you put food coloring in there, it would stay. And the colors would stay separate and would spin around and be these unusual designs. So there's no way at all that this was fireworks or anything like that. This was just huge swaths of color. And there were red and blue and green fuchsia. The biggest swaths of color were white. And these look like lightning strikes coming up from the forested area to the top of the sky. And it only lasted a few seconds. I looked over to the guy next to me and he rolled his window down and all I could think of was, oh, I hope he saw this, because I see things and no one ever sees them with me. And he said, I saw that too. I said, what is that? And he goes, I don't know. And we just kind of went on our way. A week, maybe a month later, I'm at my house in Burleson and my daughter's in college, so I live by myself. I have this house that was built in the early 90s. It has these windows that go from the floor to the ceiling just about. And in my bedroom there are two of those. And there's a courtyard right behind my bedroom with a locked door. I have this big 90 pound American Bulldog. And he's very sweet, but he's also protective. So that's one way I would let him out. If he had to go to the bathroom at night, I would just open the window and let him out and he would scratch on the window and let him back in. So I did that one night and I started to lay down and I hear a bark that is. I've never heard him bark like this. It was apparent when I heard it. It's an intruder. You need to get out of here. I'm getting ready to open the window. And look out, fully expecting to see a person in the yard that he's got cornered back there, but there isn't. He is barking up at a white orb. It is perfectly round and perfectly the most incredibly beautiful white thing I have ever seen. I couldn't see through it, but it glowed from within. And if you took my Toyota Corolla that I have and rounded it into a perfect ball, that would be about the size of this thing. It couldn't have been any higher than 10ft off the ground. I don't know if people will think I'm crazy or not, but it happened. So I don't know what else to say. And I actually have never told anybody this except my sister. So this glowing white orb has, coming out of the side of it, maybe a little bit wider than the width of an arm, a beam of light that doesn't come out of a portal or anything. It just comes out of the side of it, and it's shining directly at Buddy. The beam stops about probably 2ft away from him. And the light is white and clear, but it has, like, particles in it. It's hard to explain. But anyway, I could see this. I call it a skin on the outside of this thing because it was like if a craft could be alive. I knew immediately when I saw it that it was alive. It wasn't a craft. It was a living thing. And I could see how the outside skin layer, or whatever it was, was made. It was just so pure white. And so Buddy's barking at this thing, and it was like, I knew immediately. And I don't know if it was telling me this or I just knew it, but I knew it didn't want Buddy. It wasn't trying to hurt him. It just wanted me to come out and look at me. And I was looking at it, and I was hanging out halfway out the window, and I yelled, buddy. And he turned around and looked at me with this look, like, oh, thank God. And he ran as fast as he could into the house. And we slammed the window down, and Buddy jumped on the bed, and I jumped under the covers. All I could think of was, I know this isn't really a safe place, but I just want to get under the covers, close my eyes, and I don't care if it comes after me. I just want to be asleep when it does. I don't want to know. And I could feel Buddy jumping off the bed and running toward the front of the house. So at the time in my mind, I was thinking, well, it's crossing over the house and he's following it. That's kind of what I was thinking. And I don't remember what happened after that. I do remember it the next morning, but I don't remember anything else that happened after Buddy got off the bed. Anyway, that's my story. Thank you so much for having this podcast and for allowing people like me a way to tell our stories so others can hear it. Bye Bye.
47: [Speaker A] Thank you, Robin. Wow. You know, it sounds like a psychedelic experience. All those bright lights and colors in the sky. Trippy, as the hippies would say. And as much as this sounds like your typical ufo, I do have my reservations because this also sounds a lot like a little known but very real phenomenon called plasmoids. Now, the details surrounding these plasmoids are pretty complicated, but essentially a plasmoid is a self contained compact structure of plasma bound by its own magnetic fields, often appearing as a vortex or torus that can move independently like a plasma magnetic entity. These phenomena occur naturally in space, such as in Earth's magnetosphere and in solar flares, and are also created in labs for fusion research and propulsion, acting as a fundamental building block in space physics and plasma dynamics. And you know, not only are these things proven to exist, some scientists believe them to be sentient, representing either an unknown species here on our own planet, or proof of alien visitors from another.
48: [Speaker B] An example from the paper includes plasmoids interacting with space missions, showcasing behaviors that appear to reflect environmental responsiveness. These interactions underline their ability to influence.
49: [Speaker A] Human technology and raise questions about their potential complexity.
50: [Speaker B] But what makes plasmoids truly fascinating is their hypothesized connection to life itself. Some scientists propose that plasmoids might represent a fourth domain of life, existing independently.
51: [Speaker A] Of DNA based biology.
52: [Speaker B] This idea stems from their ability to self replicate and engage in seemingly purposeful interactions. Could plasmoids be a form of prebiotic chemistry or even a non carbon based life form? If so, they might hold the key to understanding the origins of life and its potential diversity across the cosmos.
53: [Speaker A] Now that clip from NASA Space News on YouTube and the paper they're referencing is posted up in the show notes, so go read all about them yourselves. But the point here is that these things do exist, and it sounds like Robin might have seen one. Now, frankly, this plasmoid topic is much bigger than we have room for here tonight. And truth be told, I'm still trying to wrap my own head around the concept. So for the second time now, I'm afraid I'm going to have to push a deep dive off to another episode, but trust me, it's coming. In the meantime, we can't thank you enough, Robin, for the reminder that these things even exist, and for the reminder that sometimes our world is a much bigger place than it seems. Thank you again Robin for the call. Any big thanks to you listener for swinging by here tonight. But don't go anywhere. I have something fun in store for you if you stick around.

57: [Speaker A] Now. Tonight's secret entry comes to us from Otto in the state of Pennsylvania.
58: [Speaker B] Hey Derek, this is otto from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. When I was younger, probably early 20s, I was working at a big box like home improvement store and I would work there till late at night a lot of the time I would have early morning shifts the next day. So because of that I had an aunt who lived nearby a couple blocks away. She lived in an apartment building with my cousin and my cousin would walk to the home improvement store and would meet the after work. It wasn't the greatest neighborhood so he would meet me there and I'd go to my aunt's place and stay the night and go to work early in the morning. So this was just like any other night. He came and met me. It was probably between 11:30 and midnight after everything was closed up. So we had a couple blocks and we get on this main road and it was kind of quiet, chillier night. I think it was early spring so maybe one or two people before we got to the main street that the apartment building was on. There weren't any cars on the street at the time. It was quiet. Me and my cousin were just talking to each other. I was close to the curb and my cousin was on the left side. There were no cars in the street and all the houses that we were going by, our apartment buildings, there was a long walkway that led up to each building. There weren't any trees or anything around this area specifically. So there was a person. It was a man. He was walking towards us probably 50ft. I didn't see where he came from. He was kind of just there. I believe he was African American and he had full camo fatigues on the standard like green and brown and those colors pants. He had a jacket on and he had a hat, and he was staring at me. And my cousin was talking, but I couldn't focus. This man was just staring at me. Walking closer to us. We get maybe 10, 15ft apart, and he starts to, you know, go beside my cousin on the inside of the sidewalk. I'm close to the curb because it's next to me. The man goes around my cousin to, you know, keep going down the sidewalk. As he does, he's still looking at me. And he says, what the are you looking at? And he just keeps walking past. I just kept walking. My cousin didn't say anything the whole time. He just kind of still going on talking. We get maybe 5, 10ft past, and I go, man, what was his problem? And my cousin says, who? Who are you talking about? And I turn around to point to the guy, and there's nobody there. Again, there are no cars on the street. You know, he couldn't have ran up into any houses or no bushes or anything around. It was very empty street. My cousin had the guy literally walk directly past him. He didn't see him. I have no idea about that. I think about it all the time. But thanks for your time and thanks for having me.
59: [Speaker A] Thank you, Otto. Man, Pennsylvania is a weird place. Just a few weeks ago, we shared a story about someone wearing a hazmat suit walking around parts of the Keystone State. So I don't know, Otto, was it a ghost? Did you hallucinate this gentleman, or was he somehow only able to be seen by you? This is one of those weird stories that could have a very plausible explanation. The only problem here is I have no idea what that would be. Creepy stuff, Otto. And the perfect story for tonight's secret call. So big. Thanks again for taking the time to call in. And folks, now is the point where we go beyond the after show.

60: [Speaker B] Hi, Derek. This is Tara. About six months ago, my best friend, who was formerly a boyfriend, so we had some very close emotional ties, passed away very suddenly of a stroke. You know, needless to say, it's been incredibly hard since he passed. And just about a week before he passed away, my buddy out in Colorado lost his mother. It wasn't sudden, but it was also a stroke. And so after kind of, you know, going through all the processes of grief and dealing with everything that comes along with losing someone, I decided it was a really good time to go visit my buddy in Colorado and catch up and share, you know, our feelings about the losses. It just seemed like the right time to go. So I went for about a week. And one night, we're standing in his bathroom, and he's folding some laundry. It's a huge bathroom. And he was standing there in front of the laundry machines and folding some towels or something. I was standing over kind of closer to the shower, and we were just telling stories about our lost loved ones and kind of going through different things that we've been feeling and kind of really getting into it and comparing kind of, you know, the trauma stories and things like that. We both walked out of the bathroom, and I went into the bedroom to kind of put some of his folded clothes on his bed for him. He walked out into the hallway, and maybe a minute later, we both heard this crash, followed by another bigger crash, followed by another bigger crash and glass breaking. And we both looked at each other like, what the heck was that? It's a really quiet neighborhood. There's someone on the other side of that bathroom, but the walls are pretty thick, and we definitely knew that it came from his bathroom. So we walked in and a picture frame with, like, a painting. Across the US there's a shortage of more than 400,000 skilled trade workers in H VAC, electrical construction, and more. Now's a great time to take that first step towards a career in the trades.
