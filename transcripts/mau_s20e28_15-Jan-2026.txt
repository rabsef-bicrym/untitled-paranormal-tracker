3: [Speaker C] Sam.
4: [Speaker A] Good evening and welcome to Monsters Among Us. I am your guide, Derek Hayes. Welcome back everyone. It sure is nice to have you with us here tonight and I bet it's going to be nice for you to be here tonight as well because I have quite the program slated for this evening. Strange lights, ghostly body parts, UFOs and a 50 year old monster. But it's with a jar full of coins that we began here this evening. So please welcome Alicia from Texas to the program.
5: [Speaker D] Hi, this is Alicia and I'm from the Dallas area. This one is like short and sweet. I was living in a house close to the Houston area and there was a bunch of energy there that was unexplainable just because I experienced most of the things in my life from there. First time I had sleep paralysis, reoccurring dreams, things of that sort. But anyway, I was getting ready for work or something and I was standing in front of my vanity and doing my makeup and I had this pickle jar full of change, just that you accumulate over time. So it was like a big pickle jar and it was sitting on my mini fridge on the ground and the pickle jar was towards the back of the fridge. Anyway, I'm just listening to music, getting ready and it just goes flying off of my fridge fridge and falls on the floor and there's no way it could have fallen. It wasn't unstable and it wasn't on the edge and there's nobody else in the room and nothing going on and it didn't break was the other thing. It fell on carpet. And I didn't feel afraid or scared or like, creeped out. I was just like, how in the world did that happen? So I just kind of said out loud, okay, that's not funny.
6: [Speaker E] That could have been bad.
7: [Speaker D] Do not do that again. I was very deliberate with my words. Not that I think it would help any, but it was worth a try anyway.
8: [Speaker C] I love the show.
9: [Speaker D] Keep doing what you're doing. Thanks.
10: [Speaker A] Thank you, Alicia. Frankly, I think it's amazing that the jar didn't break. If it was filled with coins, I imagine it would be quite heavy, which you think would put a lot of strain on the glass as it made contact with the floor carpet or not. But hey, it seems like a ghost might have knocked it off the fridge, so why couldn't that same entity guide it to safety as well? And speaking of ghosts and coins, before we move on here, I'd like to share a brief, supposedly true story about a ghost in a jar of coins. The Tale of pink Lizzie. In February 1871, Clara Robertson, a student at Brinkley Female College in Memphis, Tennessee, witnessed the apparition of a young girl wearing a long pink dress in her dormitory. The girl stood near a piano before vanishing into thin air. Not long after, other students reported seeing the ghostly figure who they nicknamed Pink Lizzie. Clara claimed to have had a dream where the girl revealed that her name was Elizabeth and that she once lived on the land where the college now stood. Pink Lizzie said she would not be able to rest until something she buried had been found. Lizzie told Clara the object was located beneath a tree stump. Several days later, Clara, her father, and several local townsmen dug where Lizzie directed them to. And to their surprise, they uncovered a glass jar full of gold coins, pieces of jewelry, and land deeds. After it was retrieved, the jar was stolen by persons unknown and Pink Lizzy was never seen again. So I guess the moral of this story is if a ghost tells you about money, you listen. Thanks again, Alicia, for calling it. And folks, since Alicia's story was rather short, let's work in one more before we have to take our first break. So please join me in welcoming Kai from Washington.
11: [Speaker E] Hi, Derek, this is Kai in Washington. I'm so sorry to call you from.
12: [Speaker C] My truck, but I think I'm looking at a UFO right now. It is 6:50 in the morning and I'm going south on I5. I travel from Bellingham down to Seattle and I am here. Exit oh man, I don't know but there's this like a giant star in front of me. And I was looking at it and there's another one slightly down to the left of it. And I thought, oh, it's two planets. I wonder which ones they are. And then the lower left one, it just like faded out and then completely disappeared. I'm like, oh, weird because it was so bright. But now it came back and it's.
13: [Speaker E] Like flickery and kind of moves up.
14: [Speaker C] Next to the point.
15: [Speaker E] I think it's a planet. I want to say it's Venus.
16: [Speaker C] Yeah.
17: [Speaker E] As I'm taking this little turn, I'm.
18: [Speaker C] Realizing that is the east over there and that's where Venus is.
19: [Speaker E] I don't know if there's another planet.
20: [Speaker C] Aligned with it, but the.
21: [Speaker E] I'm lower.
22: [Speaker C] It just keeps disappearing and reappearing. And it's not too cloudy right now.
23: [Speaker E] Oh, cool.
24: [Speaker C] Never mind. They both actually just disappeared. Never mind. Whack. I have no idea what I'm looking at, but okay, I'm gonna go back to driving. Thank you.
25: [Speaker A] Thank you, Kai, for that live report. It almost sounded like one of those massive black triangle craft was about to form right in front of you. Oftentimes, those reports seem to begin with a single bright light on the horizon, only for the other two to slowly illuminate and catch up, forming that infamous delta shape. Now, Delaney was able to locate another sighting that seemed to be similar to what Kai reported along the same route in which he would have traveled and roughly on the exact same day, or at least the same week. Now, I've linked to that report from the National UFO Reporting center in tonight's show notes, and there's actually a video posted, and to me it appears to show searchlights pointed up in the air, Hollywood style. So perhaps that shed some light on what Kai saw that evening. Well, either way, we thank you, Kai, for the entry. Have a look at the show notes and let us know if this solves your conundrum or if it's possible that there's still something unidentified flying around up there. Now, gang, I'll be right back with more hair raising tales right after this. Now that the holidays are over, you might feel like you have a big spending hangover.

You know who we haven't heard much from lately? Our old friend the Shadow Man. So let's remedy that with an entry from Edward in the Lone Star State.
26: [Speaker F] Hi, this is Edward calling from Texas. I've been listening to a lot of people talk about the Shadow man and I decided to tell my story. Now this happened in 2019 or 2020, give or take, because me and my wife were dating around that time. Now we were hanging out that night and I had to go to work the next morning. So she went home and I went to bed. And at this time I had a tendency to watch and listen to TV before going to bed or in order to fall asleep. And I was watching one of my comfort shows so I know what happens and what's going to happen, which that kind of plays a role in this story. And I'm listening to it, watching it and I must have dozed off. And then while I was sleep I heard someone talking outside. So I woke up and I have this thing to when I wake up, like my brain won't let me go back to sleep until I check the front doors to make sure they're locked. I got up, I went to the front door, I locked both locks and I double checked. I locked both locks and I went back in my room. Something told me to lock my room door. I have no idea why, I've never done this, but I lock my room door also. I don't know why. And I went back and I laid back down and I started watching TV until I dozed off. And I'm Watching tv and I hear my front door doorknob twist. And I was like, no, that's impossible. I locked both locks and the door opened. And at this point I'm just like, no, this can't be real. My mind is playing tricks on me. You know, scary movie philosophy. I ignored it because I think my mind is playing tricks on me. I continue to watch my show and I'm laying down and all of a sudden I cannot move. I physically cannot move. I can only see, hear and blink at this point. And my TV is still on. I can hear it, I can see it. And the show is going in chronological order the way it's supposed to. And then all of a sudden my room door is just open. And I'm thinking, no, it's impossible. I locked my room door. I know for sure that I locked my room door. And my room door opens. And all of a sudden this big, tall, darker than dark, my room is dark. But you can still see the outline form of this figure. It was maybe six and a half feet tall and it walked in my room. At this point, my heart just starts jumping, like rapidly, just beeping fast. And this figure walked in front of my tv. And as it walked in front of my tv, my tv, I'm not able to see it anymore. So, meaning, like this figure is solid because I can't see my tv, but I can still hear it. And then it walked around my bed and it walked to where I was sleeping. And I still cannot move at this point. And this figure like hovers above me, like standing next to me, looking down at me while I'm just laying there and I'm not able to move. And this figure is above me and it leans down and it puts its face so close to my face that I can make out it's facial form. It's a face with no features. That's the best I can describe it. And all of a sudden I just shot up and I looked around, I had a tear in my eye. And my TV is still playing in the sequence it's supposed to be playing in. And all this happened in the form of maybe 35 seconds, 45 seconds, give or take, maybe even a minute. Because I know the show I was watching, I know what happened. And I just looked around. I shot out of my bed, I went to my front door, my front door was locked. And I came back in my room. And at this point I'm just too scared to go to sleep. But yeah, that's my story. Thanks for listening. And I love everything you do. I listen to your podcast. Going to work. Thank you so much.
27: [Speaker A] Thank you Edward. Now, if I'm honest, some of the aspects of this experience sound like sleep paralysis to me. The inability to move the figure walking the bedroom, and the fact that Edward was in bed in position to nod off when the experience took place. But hey, I wasn't there and Edward was. And he sure does sound shaken to me. So who am I to question? Thank you again, Edward for taking the time to tune in. Now gang, if you have a tale you would like to tell here on the show, give the hotline a call at 888-6089 that's 888608 night or shoot me a voice memo to monsters among us podcastmail.com and don't forget the simple guidelines as you ring in.

28: [Speaker G] Hi Derek, longtime listener, first time submitter. I got a strange one for you. Not really explainable and I'm not quite sure how to classify it. It was probably 2019, August or September. I was working a sunrise shift, so I would wake up at 3am to get ready for work and to set it up. I would walk out of my bedroom and I would turn right down a hallway and go straight to my kitchen. My kitchen has one window on the left and one window straight ahead. So I wake up like usual, three in the morning. I walk into my kitchen, all my lights are off and this bright white light, like I'm talking, it felt like someone was holding a flashlight up to my face. How bright it was moves from below up through my windows. Both the one to my left and the one straight ahead lit up like my entire kitchen area. And I could never quite explain it because the window to my left faces directly to my neighbor and the one straight ahead, it's got a horizontal street going across and then there's a church. So there's no car coming in any direction. There's no way that someone's high beams are coming through my window. Somehow the one thing I recently thought it could have been was maybe a spotlight from a helicopter. But I didn't hear a helicopter. I didn't hear anything. And I'm sure if it was a Helicopter with a spotlight. There would have been something in the news about looking for somebody or something or other. Right after this happened I flicked on my lights. I was kind of shocked because, you know, had a bright light that felt like it was shined directly into my eyes. Looked out my window and you know, streets are pretty empty around three in the morning. Of course my neighbors weren't awake obviously and definitely not shining lights. This was on kind of an elevated floor, second floor anyway. So there's no way that anyone could have shown a light through my window. Just something I couldn't quite explain. Never have been able to really think of a proper explanation. It didn't help that that same night I was having very strange dreams involving aliens and stuff. I'm not suggesting any abductions or that it was aliens, but it was a strange set of dreams followed by a strange circumstance. There was no way for me to even confirm anything about being abducted. I usually sleep in the nude so I couldn't check if my pajamas were on backwards or something. Anyways, just a really strange occurrence. Never been able to explain it and it's always kind of stuck in the back of my head and just something I always remember. Anyway, thanks, bye.
29: [Speaker A] We appreciate the entry, caller, and I like your debunking attempts here. But there is one possibility that you can add to your list. What if a few police officers on foot were working through the area and momentarily shined their super bright flashlights into the windows, perhaps looking for a burp or a sign of a break in. But that's just a hunch. Ufo, ghost helicopter, bald lightning, or local constable. Whatever caused the disturbance, you did the right thing by sharing it with us, caller. So thank you again for sharing the submission. Now gang up. Next we hear from Bob. Please welcome him to tonight's program.
30: [Speaker C] Hi Derek, my name is Bob. I'm calling you from the Detroit, Michigan area. So I just listened to an episode where a caller was talking about her and her husband. I think hearing Native American flute music while her friend and her husband didn't, it reminded me of my story. So I'm a professional musician and I teach music lessons as well. So one day I go to the place where I teach music lessons. I'm upstairs and it's very early, so I'm the only one there besides the guy who ran the place. And I could hear a violin playing. So obviously it's not that shocking to hear a violin playing in a music lesson studio. But we didn't have a violin teacher at the time. So I walked around to every room. There was nobody there but the guy who ran the place. I walked into his office, I asked him if he heard the violin, and he looked at me with a horrified look on his face and said, yeah, do you hear it too? So we looked in every studio. We couldn't find it. There was a bar downstairs from us which was like an R and B hip hop bar, but they weren't open. But we walked down there anyway. The doors were closed. There was nobody inside. There were no cars in the parking lot. So to this day, I have no idea where this violin music was coming from. The radio was not on in the music studio. The guy that was in the office was just sitting there doing work on his computer. There was no radio on, There were no windows open. We were kind of set off the road pretty far back off the road actually. So even if somebody had music playing in their car with their windows down, we wouldn't hear where we were. I've never been that frightened in my life because that music wasn't coming from anywhere, but we both heard it perfectly clear. So that's my story. Love the podcast. Keep it spooky. Thanks.
31: [Speaker A] Thanks, Bob. Our editor, Connor, was quick to remind me that some local radio stations can bleed over onto practice amplifiers. And assuming that this facility was full of those amplifiers, perhaps there was some sort of interference at play here. Or maybe there's a history there in the building. Or maybe the energy released from the music that's been performed there has somehow been preserved in the materials that make up the walls. Stranger things have happened, but personally, I'm hoping it was a ghost. Thank you again, Bob for taking the time to call.

32: [Speaker C] Show Notes, benefits and the importance of Was It a Laundry Room to be.
33: [Speaker A] Now with spirits still on the mind, please welcome Nate out of the state of Idaho.
34: [Speaker C] Hey Derek, this is Nate from Eastern Idaho. This experience happened in the early to mid-90s. I was probably, you know, around 11 or 12. My brother had recently moved down to southern Utah and gotten married so my brothers drove us down to visit him and he was living in an older one bedroom apartment complex on the second floor. So at night my parents got the couches to sleep on and I got to sleep on the living room floor. Well, the place I was sleeping looked straight through the living room down the hall towards the bathroom and bedroom. The little kitchen in this place was just off to the right before the hallway. So it was pretty late at night, maybe 12 1am and I just couldn't sleep because of the heat. I believe this was late July, probably close to 100 degrees outside and the ceiling fan was almost directly above me. It just wasn't helping out. So there I was just listening to my Walkman cassette player when movement in the hallway just caught my eye. It looked like my brother was coming down the hallway but you know, it didn't look like him at the same time. It was just different. He looked almost transparent like and he seemed to be coming directly at me without moving. Wasn't until he got closer. I looked up and saw his head seemingly go right through the fan blades without affecting them or him. He wasn't that tall so I was confused and looked down to see him floating close to almost a foot off the ground. When I looked back up, he was straight above me. He looked right at me, put his pointer finger to his lips in kind of a shushing gesture, and then floated to the kitchen, to the main door, and then disappeared through it. You know, I don't think I moved the rest of the night. I just lay there, scared and confused. I never saw my brother come back in, if, you know, that was my brother. But when morning finally did arrive, his bedroom door opened. I just stared at him, not even responding to him when he said, good morning. He looks fully normal now. And I was hoping he'd make a comment about whatever happened the night before, but he never did. He just behaved like nothing ever happened. Well, I never told anybody this story because, honestly, it confused the hell out of me and couldn't explain it. So it wasn't until I got some of your episodes about the living hauntings and astral projection that it hit me that Esma explained what I saw those years ago. Thank you so much for the podcast, Eric. I really appreciate the platform. Have a great one. Thank you.
35: [Speaker A] Thank you, Nate. Those sure are some muddy waters you're treading in. The astral projection, living ghosts, doppelganger territory. The more stories like Nate's that I process, the more I'm beginning to think that a lot of this is the exact same phenomena, just given a different name. It's wild stuff, Nate. And we thank you again for calling in. Now remember, you can further support the program by visiting our merch shop at monsters among us podcast.com and by clicking the shop tab. And we sure would appreciate it if you did. Now, we'd also appreciate it if you helped me welcome Stacy from Vermont to tonight's program.
36: [Speaker E] Hi, Derek. This is Stacy from southern Vermont. This happened in Westover, Vermont, at a restaurant that I used to work at called the Last Chair. So basically, this place does have history. It is haunted. The paranormal investigators of New England have come out and investigated it. I got to investigate it with them as well. There's nothing, you know, malevolent or anything there, but there's definitely some things there. So my story is I was working one evening, and at the time, we had this area kind of by these stairs that was kind of in the middle of the restaurant. There was an unopened part of just a restaurant that we have that's kind of on the other side of the stairs. Anyways, these stairs give everyone an eerie feeling, including me, including the investigators. But anyways, at that time, we had our backup kind of supplies there. And so I went over because I had to grab some backup, like, kitty cups. And during that time, I didn't have an eerie feeling at all when I went over there. Usually I feel like someone is standing on the stairwell watching me. However, this time, nothing like that. Now, we weren't allowed to be on our phone, but I'm like, I'm stepping away. We're not busy. I wanted to check my phone. So I was about to pull it out of my apron, and then all of a sudden, I heard a whistle. It was my boss's whistle. And so I didn't take my phone out because I'm like, okay, well, he's there. I'm not going to take my phone out. And then I don't see him. So then I'm like, well, that's kind of weird, but okay, I'm going to walk over. And I bet you anything he's not in the kitchen right now, because that night he was working in the kitchen doing expo on the line. And so I thought for sure there was no way he was going to be in the kitchen. I walk over, he is standing in the kitchen. So I go in and I say, hey, were you just next door or, you know, upstairs? There is an upstairs, like, loft area. Even though I knew there was no way he could have gotten from that part of the restaurant back over to the kitchen without me seeing him. And he said, no, I've been in here. And I said, well, is anyone else supposed to be over there? He's like, no. So we go over. There is no one in the lower part, the other side of the restaurant. There is no one upstairs. And actually, as a matter of fact, as soon as we went upstairs, the hair on the back of his arm stood up and he had goosebumps. And I did see that. So that was something kind of crazy that happened. It reminds me of, like, a mimic, because it sounded just like his whistle enough for me to not take my phone out because I thought he was, you know, in the vicinity right there. So, yeah, thanks so much, Derek. Have a great day.
37: [Speaker A] Thank you, Stacy. Now, we tried to dig up some of the stories from the Last Chair Restaurant, but whatever activity is going on there, mom seems to be the word, because I didn't find much of anything on the old World Wide Web. We did, however, learn that the restaurant embraces the spooky. And according to Google, restaurant staff dress in costumes near Halloween. And they've been known to host a haunted house on the premises. But outside of that, I couldn't find many first hand accounts anywhere describing the first chair. So we're just going to have to take Stacy's word for it here tonight. But based on what she said, the place seems plenty active. A big thanks to Stacy for sharing that haunted location here with us. Now moving on to this next one and visiting a theme that we've explored before here on the program. Please welcome Peter out of Tennessee.
38: [Speaker C] Hey Derek, it's Peter from Tennessee. So I had a weird thing happen to me while running at night. I often run around midnight and then I'll go to bed. For some reason it helps me sleep. But this one night I was running and I ran up a cul de sac and ran back down. And my neighborhood has uniform mailboxes. They're all brick and they all have a light pole in them. For some reason I'm fixated on this light pole to my left, this mailbox to my left. And as I'm looking at it, smoke emanates from it. And my first thought is a fuse blew out or something. And as the smoke rises, it takes the form of a miniature body. Now, this body didn't have arms or torso, just legs, like something that's about a foot tall, walking in the air from right to left, right in front of my path and then disappeared. It was one of the weirdest things I've seen. I've seen some paranormal things in my time, but I've never heard of some really small, almost like a child and walking like a man, upright in air and then disappearing. Hope you like it. Love the show. Toodles.
39: [Speaker A] Thank you, Peter. Now, as weird as this account is, it's not the first time we've heard one like it. It's not even the second time. In fact, we've received this exact same report at least twice before. Though my fading memory is telling me that we've received accounts like this many more times than even that. But the two calls to stick out to my team and I are from season 10, episode 19 in which Kelly in Alabama detailed a little green butt and a pair of legs running across the street. Here's a short portion of that original entry.
40: [Speaker E] Hi, my name is Kelly.
41: [Speaker C] In maybe 2000 in Alabama, in Birmingham, my best friend lived along a really.
42: [Speaker E] Dark, treed, very twisty winding road. Old Rocky Ridge Road. And there's a bridge that goes over the highway.
43: [Speaker C] And as I was driving across the.
44: [Speaker E] Bridge about 9:30pm I was probably driving.
45: [Speaker C] About 35 miles an hour. I saw a little green fluorescent butt. I say fluorescent because it was glowing. I saw a little green butt run across the road.
46: [Speaker E] It was about 2ft tall at the top of the butt. It had legs and feet.
47: [Speaker C] It was like a little chubby.
48: [Speaker E] There was no top half to this.
49: [Speaker C] Little creature or spirit or whatever it was.
50: [Speaker E] It moved extremely quickly because it ran across in front of my car in my headlights.
51: [Speaker C] It didn't look see through or anything like that. I cannot imagine what it might have been.
52: [Speaker A] And the second call came to us just last season when Will from Texas shared a similar story, which originally aired on season 19, episode 17. Here's a chunk of that call as well.
53: [Speaker C] Hi Derek, My name is Will and I'm from Texas. I do deliveries for work and it was nighttime. I had just gotten off work and as I'm turning around a corner corner in my vehicle, I see as I am nearing another bend in the road going to the right up ahead in my headlights is just a pair of legs walking on the grass going to the right. Imagine just a pair of legs walking. It kind of looks like a Slinky or something, but there were shadows. There were no animals at that time as far as I know. I just thought it was a really strange one just to see a pair of human shadowy legs just walking without a torso to accompany it. Alright, thank you very much.
54: [Speaker A] So there you have it Peter. Almost an exact match if you ask me. Now, matching reports is one thing, but getting to the bottom of them, well, it's another.

59: [Speaker D] Are just two.
60: [Speaker A] Now gang down to our final two calls of this main portion of the program. And to kick off this back half, we venture up to Canada. Please welcome Jay to the show.
61: [Speaker H] Hey, Derek. My name's Jay. I am from Canada. The story has to do with a group of us that went out to a country road. And I was in the passenger seat of the car my friend Greg was driving. We were both looking at each other talking about stuff. There was two guys in the back of the car, one guy, his head down, the other guy was looking kind of forward. This is about 10:30 at night in the summer and right in the front of the car, the brightest light that we've ever seen. It was unexplainable. It was kind of a whity green, but it was really bright and it seemed to last for probably about six to seven seconds and then it just vanished. And we were all super confused of what was going on. We looked around, turned the lights on in the car to look at each other and she was like, what the heck was that? And Greg's left side of his face because he was the driver, his left side of his face was completely red. The other side of his face was white. We're Caucasian. And my right side of my face was red and the left side of my face was white. And the guy that had his head down, he was completely same color as he was previous. And the guy that was looking forward, his entire face was red. And it seemed to be a time lapse thing too because looked like it was 11:35 when we kind of were like, what the hell is going on? And what we're like, we got to get the out of here. Sorry about the language. And we started driving and everything seemed to be going really slow but fast at the same time. And it looked like we were going to run into the back of some sort of vehicle. And my buddy slammed on the brakes and this vehicle just appeared out of nowhere and then it just disappeared. And there was just a pop can blowing down this country road in the middle of the road like, what the heck is going on? And I looked out to the right side of the vehicle in the field. I swore I could see these probably about 4 foot tall darker beings they were because they were in the grass through the Tree line. But they were walking around this field. I just yelled out, like, get out of here. Let's go, let's go, let's go. And we got out of there, and we stopped in town, and we were like, I don't know what just happened, but we can't tell anybody about that because that was completely weird. And Greg's mom, she owned a New Age store, and there was a lot of spiritual people in the store. Anyway, it was about a week later we went to Greg's house. He lived down in the city with his mom. We knocked on the door, and his mom, Carol, answered the door, and she looked at me, and she just smiled this huge smile. She was an amazing woman. She's passed on now. She passed away from cancer, but she was very intuitive. And she just looked at me and she's like, huh, You've been touched by the light. That's special. And she turned around and walked away. And two minutes later, Greg came to the door. And we're like, dude, did you tell your mom about that stuff? And he's like, no, I haven't told anybody about it. And so I'm like, she just came up to me and said that I was touched by the light. And this happened when we were in our 20s and I'm now 51. I just texted him today and reiterated that evening to him. And he was like, yeah, maybe that comet is the reason why our faces turned red and the little people are the ones that touched us. And that sort of blows me away. Anyway, that area of that country road had government signs of do not trespass, don't access. And they were actual government signs that have been put up same time period. Anyway, that's my story. Thanks for listening, and hopefully this makes it on your show. Have a good day.
62: [Speaker A] Thank you, Jay. You know, a year or two ago, I talked a lot about green lasers that were being blasted down to Earth in several different parts of the country. Florida and Hawaii specifically, if I remember correctly. Check out season 17 episode 12 to learn more about that. But lately, I've been seeing more reports about these green lasers, and it makes me wonder if that's not what Jay saw that evening. But I will admit there were no humanoid figures associated with those other sightings. And I certainly haven't heard anything even remotely similar to what Jay's friend's mother told him. But it sure seems like she knew something that we didn't. So, Jay, what an insane series of events. Thank you again for sharing with us. And just like that, gang, we're at tonight's final entry, but trust me when I say I left something fun for the finale. Please welcome Ayla to tonight's program.
63: [Speaker E] Hi, my name is Ayla and I'm from Brownsville, Texas. I was just watching a pretty popular TikTok account where they tell scary stories. And this girl was saying a story from South Texas, talking about a large bird, possibly even a pterodactyl, but it was like human like that they saw in their barn. They didn't say what city, but they said south Texas. And it reminded me that I have this memory from when I was young. This would have been in the early 90s, so there was no Internet back then. But I have this memory that I was watching the news with my parents and there was this like huge bird that was the size of a man and it looked like a man. Like the body and everything looked 100% like a man, but it had feathers and everything like a bird and it had a face like a bird. And so it was a bird, but also looked like a man. I want to say it was either at the flea market or downtown, you know, an area that's very populated. And I want to say that there was even a photo of this thing that was either on the news or in the newspaper. And they were just saying that they had no idea what it was. And I want to even say this man bird thing, like a bluish color. But I had that memory. And whenever I've asked my parents about it, they have no idea what I'm talking about. And whenever I google it, I don't find anything about that. So I've, you know, just given up on that and thought, well, maybe it was just like a dream. But I don't know why it's like a strong memory if it's just a dream. I mean, we are on the border of Mexico and there's, you know, the legend of the lechrusas, the witches that turn into the owls, but this is not an owl. Didn't look like an owl at all. It did also remind me of you. Not long ago played a story, and I want to say South Texas, but they didn't specify where exactly. And they said that they saw this huge bird that looks like an owl. I want to say they said it even had like an owl face, but the body of a woman and that the woman looked like she was wearing like the scuba outfit or whatever, the neoprene, you know, but white. I thought that was interesting. Who knows, maybe somebody has a story similar or same memory. Maybe it wasn't a memory. Anyway, thanks for listening and hope we can get some answers soon.
64: [Speaker A] Thank you, Ayla. A massive man shaped bird down in the southern reaches of Texas. Actually, that does ring a bell. In fact, 50 years ago this week, the Brownsville area and really the entire Rio Grande Valley experienced a flap of sightings that would rival the events that occurred in Point Pleasant, West Virginia. The following news clip is a blast from the past. An early 2000s clip from KDFW Fox News 4 out of Dallas, Fort Worth.
65: [Speaker C] The first reported sighting January 1, 1976. Five miles south of Harlingen, Texas, near an irrigation ditch. Two school girls, ages 11 and 14 reported seeing a horrible looking bird of extraordinary size. They claimed it was 5ft tall. Its wings were folded around its body. The frightened girls reported it had large, dark red eyes. Days that followed, the local newspapers carried more stories, reports from others who cited a similar creature. One in particular from The Brownsville Heron. January 8, 1976. According to the story, two San Benito policemen claimed to have seen the creature, but its primary eyewitness was a Brownsville man named Alberto Guajardo. Something had struck his trailer the night before, and when he went outside, he encountered a feathery creature, four feet tall with terrible looking eyes. It's got wings like a bird, but it's not a bird, Guajardo said. That animal is not from this world. But whatever Alberico Guajardo described to Bill Young seemed not to be a bird at all. Red, glowing eyes.
66: [Speaker G] He thought it was something demonic and.
67: [Speaker C] That'S what really frightened him and his family. However you explain it, whatever it was, the big bird sightings in the Rio Grande Valley ended as abruptly as they began. For the first few months in 1976, there were a whole series of reports, some of them from very credible people. After that, nothing for now more than 20 years.
68: [Speaker A] Now it is worth mentioning that there has been physical evidence collected of these winged beasts. In the very same news clip I just shared with you, a witness described seeing, holding and even photographing a feather that was left behind by the creature when it struck the house trailer. According to the clip, that feather, which conveniently seems to have disappeared, measured over three inches wide. Any whopping three to three and a half feet long. And before I sign off here tonight, you know I get a kick out of it when folks make music about their monsters. And thanks to a discovery by Delaney, I have yet another example of that to share with you. Here is a short portion of La Leienda del Pajaro Grande, or the Legend of the Big Bird by Wally Gonzalez. Now if you're listening to this on YouTube, you may not be able to hear the song due to clearance issues, but follow the link in the show notes to listen to the song directly. And for you English only speakers, which includes me for the most part, here is what old Wally sang about back in 1976. The following is a direct translation. Thanks to our editor Connor hey little birdie. He told us what's happening, that a giant bird is scaring the people around the fruit orchards. It appeared suddenly. It only comes out at night and hides during the day. Those who saw it said that the figure is colored white, its 4ft high, it beats its wings, its feet are like stilts, eyes like large coins, and a beak two feet long. And the chorus states and this is the story of a giant bird that you can find in Texas and was talked about for a long time. No, obviously some of the message was lost in translation, but I think we get the gist. And it's wild stuff and awfully timely too, given that that original flap occurred 50 years ago this week. Absolutely incredible. Thanks again Ayla for calling. And folks, that about wraps it up for tonight, at least for this portion of the program. But before we close things out here tonight, a very important announcement regarding the show will be dark the next two weeks. The team and I worked right through the holidays and now that we're in the slow part of the year, we're going to take a couple of weeks to rest, relax, recharge and update a few things here in the store studio. So we'll be back on February 3rd with a brand new installment and hopefully you'll be there waiting for us Now.

74: [Speaker C] Of having wants and.
75: [Speaker A] Desires for the future. Now, on last week's secret entry, I shared a story from JW in Alabama about the Sandman and a magical dust that the Sandman used to essentially put JW to sleep. Well, in my prep for this week's episode, I came across the following call and I couldn't wait to share it with you. So here with another Sandman encounter is Nadia from the Commonwealth of Virginia.
76: [Speaker D] Hello, my name is Nadia and I'm calling from Northern Virginia. When I was younger, I I guess I was about six or seven years old. My parents, they had some friends over. It was like a party atmosphere. We were all downstairs. I guess I was just getting a little rambunctious or getting on their nerves. So they told me it was time for me to go to bed and I didn't want to go to sleep. I wanted to stay down with all of the adults and, you know, be nosy and be a kid. But they said no, it's time for bed. So they sent me upstairs and I started throwing a little tantrum. I was crying and didn't want to go to sleep. So they told me, stay in my room. So I went in my room, and I was in there crying, crying, crying. While I was crying, I noticed, like, in the corner of my room, there's this chair. And I looked at the chair, and there was just this black, dark figure. And it was, like, staticky. Like the static kind of you would see on a television. It was just growing and getting bigger and coming up over this chair. And because I was crying and had tears in my eyes, I thought, oh, maybe I'm just seeing things. So I went and rubbed my eyes clear and rubbed them really good and blinked and then looked again, and it was coming over the chair. Like, now it was over the chair and crawling up toward me on the bed. Like, toward the bed. It just kept getting bigger and moving forward, and I just couldn't believe it. I freaked out. So I just got under my covers and I looked one more time, and it was still moving toward me. This big figure, like, all dark, black, staticky, moving. And so I just pulled the covers up and stopped crying and just stayed under my covers all night. I didn't move or wake up until the next morning. My mom had to come in and wake me up, and I was, like, drenched because I just stayed in that position. I don't know if I told my mom or not, but in my head, I thought that that was the sandman, because, you know, I'd always heard the saying, if you don't go to sleep, the sandman is going to come and get you. You know, put sand in your eyes and make you go to sleep if you don't go to bed. And I never saw it again. But now that I've been listening to this podcast and I hear about the shadow people, I'm thinking I probably saw a shadow person, but I didn't have anything to compare it to. And, you know, I don't think I imagined it because, like I said, I cleared my eyes, like, because at first I was like, hold on. You know when you're crying and you see everything blurry? I was like, let me clear. So I rubbed my eyes really good and blinked and everything, and it was still there. And then I looked for another time, like, peeked again through my cover, still there. So, yeah, I think I saw a shadow person, but that's my story. So. Thank you.
77: [Speaker A] Thank you, Nadia. That pesky sandman again. Or Shadow man, or Static man, perhaps. Whatever it was that Nadia saw, it seemed to take on characteristics of all three entities. Super creepy. Regardless of the cause, it's. And we thank you again Nadia for sharing and thank you folks for tuning in here tonight. Because from here on out we're going beyond.

78: [Speaker C] Hey Derek, it's me. Positive Pete just happened. Right now we live in Sunnyville, California, about a mile away from Moffett Field, which also has NASA and Lockheed Martin over here. So we see a lot of plane traffic and right now 8:43 at night we saw these three lights that look brighter than usual. A lot of airplanes are in the area so we know what it looks like. They just stayed there, but then they kind of like moved and expanded a bit and then stayed level in the horizon. But they were super bright. They weren't like regular airplane lights. So I don't know. Something was there because a few planes went by it and then it got bigger.
