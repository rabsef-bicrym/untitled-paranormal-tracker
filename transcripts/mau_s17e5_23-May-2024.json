Good evening and welcome to Monsters Among Us. I'm your guide, Derek Hayes. Welcome back to yet another thrilling installment. I have quite the selection of spine tingling and fear inducing stories to share with you here this evening. But you already knew that. That's why you're here after all. So let's not waste any time and let's introduce tonight's first submitter. We were supposed to hear from this caller back in the season 17 premiere the government Worker Special episode, but I somehow misfiled the call in the wrong folder. But it's all good now. The call has been relocated and I have it here for you right now. An entry from Zach over in Parts Unknown. Hey Derek. My name is Zach. This is a call through Government Workers Special. I used to work at IT for our local county for about five years and a lot of our offices were in the really old buildings on our square One of the main buildings that we had a lot of equipment in was called the Opera House. And it used to be just that, it used to be an opera house. So I was in there late one night working on some network equipment. We do a lot of after hours hours work to avoid disrupting business hours. And I was in the basement and this basement was really strange. It almost looked like it was carved out of a cave, but it was just really old plastic walls that had begun to warp for me. But I was in the basement and I was working on the switch and I start to hear music, orchestral music. It's really faint, really quiet. And I know that the treasurer's office, which was above me, they like to play music during the day. They had speakers in the building. So I think, well, maybe they left the music on or something. And as I go up the stairs, it keeps a constant volume, it doesn't get any louder. So I go upstairs and I walk around the treasurer's office and constant music, flat volume all the way across. Kind of quiet, kind of distant. And that's about it. Thank you much. Thanks, Zach. And sorry about the mix up with your entry. When you receive thousands of calls per year, it happens from time to time anyway. I think that's exactly the sort of activity one would expect in an old opera house. In fact, I think it would be more concerning if phantom music wasn't heard any place like that. It's almost that expected now, being there alone in the dark when said activity begins to occur, expected or not, it's gonna freak you right out. So a big thanks to Zach for sharing that entry. Now, if you're like Zach and you too have a story you would like to share here on the program, a true story, call the hotline at 888-608-NIGHT. That's 888608 NIG HT. A couple of ground rules that will ensure your story gets played. Do not call from a moving vehicle. A quiet room is always the best place. Please finish your story. I can't tell you how many people have called in with an amazing story, but they use up their five minutes and never call back to finish. So I'm left with the first half. And finally, one story per call, please. It's a bit of a nightmare when there is more than one story per call. Thus those typically get skipped over because they take extra time. So if you saw Bigfoot, a ghost and a ufo, but it wasn't all on the same day, those are separate calls. You can call them in the Same day, just make them different phone calls for my sanity. And I know many of you are patiently waiting to hear your story, so perhaps these little guidelines will help you get your story on the airwaves quicker. Now, next up, we venture to the Pacific Northwest to cover the topic you'd expect us to cover in such a location. Tony from Oregon. You talking about Bigfoot? So my name's Tony and I'm out in Oregon, towards the coast. I was on a hunting trip with my dad out in the Tillamook rainforest area, mid November. We were camping. It was like eight or nine o', clock, and we were getting ready for bed and the wind picked up and the canopy blew away. So my dad got up, was like, I'm gonna go fix this. And while he's getting ready and stuff, these shrieking sounds like. Like a cow, elk, and a coyote trying to shriek together. Mixture sounded. And there's like four or five of them. Yeah, yeah. It could just say it was some fluke or something. I think it was the urban legend, the rake, but it could be anything. I don't know. It's about the entire story. Have a good night. Thank you, Tony. Now, we already know there are a number of known species of animal that make horrendous sounds in the forest at night. We've covered that ad nauseam. But when chilling shrieking sounds are reported from the Pacific Northwest, I'm always just a little bit more willing to believe a monster might be responsible. After all, even the most casual of Bigfoot enthusiasts know that that area of the country reigns supreme when it comes to sightings of the big Guy. And for all that, we thank you, Tony, and for sharing your experience in Bigfoot country. I really need to get back up that way myself. It's been far too long. People's tax relief.

Well, folks, let's move right into another entry, shall we? This time in the form of a strange object in the nighttime sky. Ed in Texas. Welcome to tonight's program. Hi, my name is Ed and I live in Frisco, Texas. Last Wednesday, I believe it was January 17th, I was heading to work at approximately 7:20 and as I'm driving south towards Highway 121, I noticed there were three brightly lit orange lights hovering above the freeway or in that vicinity. They were in a very, very bright amber orange. I thought maybe they were planes that were coming towards me, but they never moved as I was continuing my drive south. And they were positioned diagonally in the sky. So, you know, we had one that was over to the left and the middle one was more to the right. Of course, the bottom one was, was further to the right or to the east. Then what it started to do was the top one went west and then the bottom one went right. And I kept on thinking, well, maybe these are drones doing some sort of survey. Like I was saying that the lights were extremely bright, very orange. One thing I didn't I noticed that I couldn't see any, any navigation lights. So I never saw any kind of like red or green lights on these lights. And I didn't see any kind of like flashing stroke. If you're ever driving around the Dallas area at night between like 7pm and 9pm we have two major airports around here. And you see all kinds of planes flying around, all kinds of commercial jets and they're very noticeable. You see their landing light, you see their hazard light. You know Their navigation lights with red and green lights, you see a blinking strobe light many times. These had none of those characteristics. They were just three bright orange lights hovering over the area of Frisco and Plano city lines. As I got closer to them, it appeared that they had moved around to different parts of the the area. I don't know what they were. Maybe they were just drones doing some sort of surveillance or survey. I was just wondering if anybody else had saw them because they were very noticeable. All right, love your podcast. Thanks for all you do. Have a good one. Thank you, Ed. Now, from the description, it almost sounds like this was another of these large deltas or triangles. That is until he mentioned one of the lights moving away from the formation independently. So I guess that sort of rules that out. But it does sort of remind me of the 29 palms footage captured here in California a few years back. Here's a segment of an interview with a few of the soldiers that actually witnessed this craft on base at the Marine Corps combat center at 29 Palms, courtesy of the weaponized podcast. If you look in the picture, you can see like a black triangular shape. Why are these not flares? Because they stayed there for a solid 10 minutes just in the same spot. And flares don't sit in one spot for 10 minutes. No, they definitely, they fall. So you personally know that these were not flares. Do you believe this was a craft? Yeah, I would have to believe so with the picture I took with the black triangular shape underneath the lights, it's definitely not any type of like flare illumination rounds or anything. So this was a craft. Was it hovering? Stationary? Was there any sound? There was absolutely no sound. No sound, but it was definitely stationary. How big was it? Estimate to me, how big compared to one of those stealth bombers, the size? Well, hold on, hold on. Stealth bombers can't hover. Exactly. That's why I can compare it to that. But that's how I know it wasn't that. I would say the size of like three bedroom house. I don't know, maybe bigger. Now, a link to that full interview can be found in the shoutouts. And this line of questioning took place just two days after this sighting, which was April 20th of 2021. But if I'm honest, the 29 palms UFO isn't the only thing that it reminds me of. Anytime I think about UFOs in the state of Texas, one deadly encounter always comes to mind. And this story starts the same way Eds does, with someone driving a vehicle down a long desolate stretch of route when they suddenly see something in the sky ahead of them that simply should not be there. December 29, 1980. The Piney woods of Huffman, Texas. At approximately nine in the evening, Betty Cash and Vicki Landrum and a seven year old boy, Colby Landrum, are driving home to Dayton. On Hoffman New Caney Road, 30 miles northeast of Houston. The boy sees a bright light in the sky heading straight towards them. This light will soon irreparably impact the lives of everyone in the car. The light descends and reveals itself to be a diamond shaped object. All of the occupants in the car feel strong heat and the two women are burned. Possibly as many as 23 double rotor military helicopters arrive on the scene and circle the craft. Though the object and helicopters eventually disappear over the tree line. For the three in the car, an ordeal which will haunt them for the rest of their lives has just begun. But the effects of this incident linger on. Both women suffer mysterious injuries years later. According to their families, their deaths are caused by the incident. Now that clip courtesy of UFO Hunters on the History Channel. And as the clip alluded to, both women got incredibly sick. Betty Cash more so than Vicki Landrum. And from what I gather, the young boy suffered from skin blisters and vomiting as well. So all three were affected. Now Betty died 18 years to the day of her sighting back in 1998 and Vicki passed away in 2007. And while we were researching this story, I stumbled upon something I'd never heard of before. It was the original report Vicki Landrum made to the National UFO Reporting Center, A UFO reporting hotline that's been in existence for a long, long time. Well, the recording made back in 1981 wasn't exactly easy to listen to, but I ran it through a few filters and managed to make it presentable. And since this is a show made up of first hand accounts, I thought it might be fitting to share part of her report here tonight. So the following call was made by landrum herself on February 2 of 1981. Yes sir, this is Victor Landrum from Dayton, Texas. Yes, a vehicle come down and it was like fire was coming from it right ahead of us and we had to stop and we got out of the car, which I didn't stay out for just a minute because I had my little grandson, which I got coach of and I got back in the car, there's nothing happened to me, but my eyes was burned. But the Betty cat that was with me that night not started coming and she had a real terrible headache and so she's been in Parkview Hospital over two weeks. I got out and she stayed two weeks. And I had to put her back. And all of her hair has come out. They can't find out exactly what's wrong with you, but not along with her. They keep saying it could be this. There's a possibility of that. But instead of her getting better, she gets worse. And couldn't have had anything to do with that thing that we stood and watched because we was close enough to it that we found a fire from it. How close do you feel you were to that? I'd be safe to say it wasn't more than maybe a block and a half. Lit up the whole element. And I thought the world was coming to the end. I really did. Told my grandson not to be afraid, that if he saw something come out of it, that it would be Jesus. I found a way I could explain to him to keep him from going into this area. Was this a fairly large object? Yes, sir. Would it be larger than your car? Yes, sir. And did it land on the ground? No, sir. We come down almost in a creek and then it went back up and went to the right of it. And we tried 23 helicopters. There might have been more coming on 1960 over here. We counted those helicopters up, though. So there has to be somebody that knew about it. If it was caused from that. I won't. I don't want her to die. I want her to get better. Now, a link to the full recording can be found in tonight's show notes at monsters among us podcast.com and you can really hear the desperation in her voice. She's really worried about Betty. Now, it's widely known that the pair later went on to sue the military for damages, but lost in court. And to this day, it is not known what was encountered along that lonely stretch of Texas highway, nor do we know what was caught on camera over 29 bombs or what it was that Ed saw that evening. But what we do know is that something is out there. The more important question is, should we be afraid of it? Thank you again, Ed, for opening the rabbit hole.

Now we've discussed how certain some buildings have a tendency to be haunted more than others. Places with large crowds or tons of nervous activity hospitals, prisons, museums, theaters, and even schools make that list. And it's in the latter that this next entry takes place. So just imagine yourself working at a school all alone over the graveyard shift. Now imagine doing it. Listening to an episode of MAU Brad in Missouri will tell you what to expect. Hi Derek. You can call me Brad from Missouri. I'm a school custodian and I have had some paranormal experiences. I've had a lot, but most recently down my hallway there has been like this heavy energy. Like I don't want to be around it. So I try to clean it as quick as possible. Well, one night I go home and one of my family members told me if I could cleanse the house like I normally do because they saw the night before a bouncing green ball of light in the bathroom. And I said okay. And so I cleansed the house and we had investigated and there was no way a green ball of light could have been there. We didn't have anything plugged in and the way the curtain is, it's against the wall completely so no light could go in. Well, the day I had cleansed the house, I had asked whatever was there to please go back or move on. And I tried to be as polite as possible. I go to work and all of a sudden all of my equipment starts falling over. Every time I set something down, it falls over my vacuum on the floor and normally I grab it, drop the cord to the floor, and unless there's a tangle, which there wasn't, it won't fall. Well, later that night, it's dark, I'm alone. I decided to go clean windows in that side of the building where that heavy energy was. And it was more intense this time. And I walked down in one of the wagons that they like to drag the kids around in, you know, to the playground. It moved and it squeaked like someone had pulled the handle. And the wagon was in this room that I know for sure it was not in there before when I cleaned. And mind you, all the staff on that side of the building leave well before I get down there. So that's my story for right now. Thank you for listening. I hope you can use this and I'll call back with some more stories. Thank you, Brad. Now, I have had a lot of different jobs throughout my life, but I was never a custodian. And I guess I'm thankful for that. Not because I got to skip out on all that hard work, although I doubt it would be missing much of it, but rather because it would put me alone in a potentially haunted building each and every work night. My imagination is just too good. I already know I'll find ways to creep myself out. But I have been in similar territory though. I worked for a student security program in college and part of my duties was to lock various administrative buildings there on campus at like 11pm or midnight. I don't remember. It was too long ago, but it was dark. And that's the point. And you know, some of those places were nearly 100 years old at the time. You could literally feel the energy flowing out of some of these spaces. Or maybe that was just my imagination again. Anyway, any small way I sort of get where Brad is coming from here. And let me say, those are not fun shoes to be in, but we do. Thank you Brad for sharing your nervousness with us and please do let us know if anything else strange occurs there.

And while you're perusing the T shirt selection there, please enjoy this unsettling entry from Alonzo in the Bluegrass state. Hey, Derek. This is Alonzo from Northern Kentucky. I got a little story for you that happened to me back in high school. Weird ghost story. I was dating this girl who was a practicing Wiccan. Like, her mother practiced it, and I think her grandma did too. So it's kind of a thing. I wasn't really big into it, but it didn't bother me none. I remember it was summertime, thinking, like 2004, 5, I don't remember. And we were going to stop by one of her friend's house. It was like late afternoon. So I drove her to her friend's house. I think her friend also was practicing Wicca. So we stopped by our friend's house and the two go upstairs. They said they had something to do. And so, like, no boys allowed or whatever. So I hung out downstairs. No one was in the house. The apartment was empty. So I'm sitting in the living room and I just decide to lay down on her couch. So laying on the couch to have my back to the living room and where I was laying at, I could look through this. There's a picture of their family, family portrait. And on the glass of the picture frame, it kind of reflected the room behind me because the light was coming in. So I kind of lay there for a second, closed my eyes, felt weird for a second, felt like somebody entered the room and opened my eyes. And through that picture frame, that glass behind me, I saw a shadow standing in the doorway of the front door. My first thought was, oh, her dad came home. Or brother, older brother or something. This tall figure. I immediately thought it was a male. And it was just standing there. So it kind of freaked me out. So I played dead, just kind of laid there. I'm gonna act like I'm gonna sleep. And the figure just continued to stand there and stare at me, which freaked me out. Hadn't for a couple of minutes, I just stared at it. It stared at me. Then I heard the girls coming downstairs. You could hear them coming down the steps. I counted to like 1, 2, then turned around, act like I woke up to meet this person. And no one was there, not a soul. Two girls came down, looked at me. They could see my confused look on my face and they said what's the matter? And I looked at them and said what did you do? And they just giggled and we left. Nothing more was said. I never brought it back up. I don't know if they were asking for something to stop by or I was getting watched, who knows, but there was definitely something there watching me lay on that girl's couch. I don't know. Weird story. Definitely Love the podcast. Keep knocking them out. Love listen to the episodes. Thanks. See you Knock them out I shall. Thank you Alonzo. Well, that's certainly interesting. And if I'm understanding correctly, it's Alonzo's theory that this girlfriend, whom is a serious Wiccan practitioner, somehow manifested this entity in her own home. I don't know, I'd probably be more into religion if it produced results like this. No one mentioned to me that you can conjure up monsters. But in all seriousness, I wonder if there is a connection there or if this is all just one big coincidence. An eerie one, but a coincidence nonetheless. But I'll keep my ears open, Alonzo, to see if any other Shadow man stories mention Wiccan or any other religion for that matter. It just might be onto something.

Know, there's a certain trio we haven't heard from in a long while. So here with a call that'll be sure to have you seen triple Is an anonymous caller from the state of Arkansas. Hi, I'd like to remain anonymous. This took place in Little Rock, Arkansas, in the summer of 1991. I was working on a warehouse for a newspaper called the Arkansas Gazette. And this warehouse was right next to an abandoned train station called the Rock Island Train Station. You can look it up online. I believe it's been refurbished. Beautiful old building, but it was completely dilapidated, abandoned, and it backed up to a rail yard and the river warehouse district, which at the time was completely abandoned and very sketchy. Dangerous area. I worked overnights at this warehouse with a bunch of really interesting characters. And one night we were sitting on the loading dock on a summer evening. There was not much going on. 3 o' clock in the morning, and we saw some people over by the Rock Island Railroad station station, which was strange because even homeless folks would avoid it because you couldn't hardly walk through that area without getting covered in tar. And there were so many railroad tracks and debris that it was really, you know, not practical to walk through there, even to have a shortcut. It was just more trouble than it was worth. So it was strange to see someone over there at all. But it was three people, and they were all walking exactly right next to each other, the exact same height, build, and they were wearing very distinct outfits for the time. This was 1991, and hockey jerseys were kind of a fad at the time. Even though no one in Little Rock really watched hockey, you would sometimes see someone in a hockey jersey, and that's what I initially thought. Why would three people in hockey jerseys that were very clean be walking in this very dirty area? Very, very bad area to be by yourself this time of night, even with two friends. But as I looked closer, I realized their movements were exactly mirrored, like they were androids. There were four or five guys on the loading dock with me. We all noticed it and began talking about it. You know, who are these people? What are they doing? And the clothes stood out. The clothes were very green, kind of dark green and light green. Big sweaters. And this was a summer night in Little Rock, Arkansas. So it would have been in the 90s and humid. And they were wearing what looked like big corduroy pants that were light colored, like light color khaki. They just looked homemade kind of. They were far off. But you could tell that the clothes had a strange quality to them. You know, I had no idea what was going on, but I knew that it didn't look like homeless people or anyone else who would be in the area because it's a house district. If you weren't there to do newspaper business or a transient person living in an area where there's really nothing for those folks at all in terms of people or infrastructure or even a bathroom. So you really didn't see many people there. And it was really strange. As soon as we saw them, they were at kind of a strange angle. And they walked around the edge of the warehouse and then around the edge of the Rock island train station, abandoned in the distance. And I was the youngest guy there, and I said, well, I'm gonna go see what that was. And they all said, you know, don't go see what that is. No matter what it is, it's not worth going over there and potentially, you know, getting in a fight or getting robbed or something. But I was, you know, intent on it. And I went across the parking lot and through some weeds and around this abandoned turn of the century train station, and I saw a fire. A little campfire was built underneath the awning of the train station. And it was bright, it was very luminous. But I had not seen any light prior to that. And you would be able to see it would have lit up the entire train station, would make it all luminous. That light actually made the other guys from the warehouse come start to look for me. But this campfire, which was, you know, what I would describe as a very small campfire and a ring of stones on a broken piece of concrete. It was bright, like it had just sparked. And as I stood there looking at it, all I could think of was who had made this fire. I'm disturbing someone. Someone is in this immediate vicinity. So I should, you know, be aware of what's going on. Maybe that's who these people were. The next thing I knew, the fire without completely. And I was hearing my name being called, and I was feeling the cold wind of morning on my cheek, which, if you work outside overnight, there's a certain breeze that you feel right before sunrise. And you know, like, oh, hey, morning's coming. So I'm not quite sure what happened. I was standing in the exact same spot where I remember stopping. The guys from the warehouse came to look for me. They couldn't find me. They didn't see a campfire. They did see the light. That's why they came to look for me. So I had about an hour of missing time. It was about 3am this was maybe 4:35am that they found me. They were calling for me all. All across this big warehouse building. So I go back to the warehouse, and the boss's elderly dad is there, and he would come down sometimes and just hang out with everybody who's kind of a salty old character. And he told me that those things were demonic. And he said that if you were to ever see three people walking in unison like that, that you would never look at them, never pursue them, and look the other way, go the other way. And he said that he had encountered them with his former business partner when they were young men. And this. This man was very old and he's passed on many years ago now. He said he had encountered them in central Arkansas in what would have been the 1950s with his friend out in the field. And they had a similar experience where they went around the edge of a barn and had lost time later that week. His friend was a race car driver, and he was the race car mechanic. The engine that he worked on exploded and cut the man's legs off. He later ended up dying of the injuries. So my boss's father, who was telling me this story, blames himself for it. And he blamed the mirrored men. They cursed him. And so when I heard your podcast, you know, a few years ago, and you had given these characters a name and some. Some more, it really made my blood run cold because I have not shared this with anyone, and I'm sure that that old man has not shared that story with many people because he was very upset telling the story you could tell. He did not want to talk about race cars or engines. And he had told me a thousand stories. So, anyway, I love the show. Keep up the good work. Thanks very much. Thank you, caller. Now, if I were the abbreviating type, I'd label this one as a cmms, a classic mirrored men story, because all the elements are there. It seems to be in a rural setting. There are three beings, all identical, all moving in unison. The entities look strange, unusual, particular enough that our caller saw it fit to investigate further. And of course, there was missing time involved. The only element that seems to be missing here is the odd or inclement weather, though our caller did mention that it was very hot and very humid that day back in 1991, but that's probably not all that unusual for that part of the country, but it's enough to convince me that this experience does fall under the mirroredmen umbrella. Note to self New merch idea Mirrored Men Umbrellas now, identifying a mirrored min story is easy. Explaining it is something else altogether. I'm just as confused and intrigued now as I was when I first heard one of these stories some 20 years ago. And I should point out that yet again, we have knowledge or past information presented by an old timer, someone we assume had a prior run in with these mysterious men. The first time we heard the warnings of look away and walk away was in an email sent in by a listener named Kent. Here's a snippet of the information Kent's grandfather bestowed upon him in regards to this terrifying trio. So when I was a young man, my father used to tell me, kent, if you ever see three men moving in a funny sort of way, all the same, look away, away and walk away, calm as you can, like you didn't see anything out of the ordinary. I'd ask him why and he'd always say, just you listen. No need to know more. The thing is, he would tell me and my sister this a lot. At least twice a year, from as far back as I can remember when I was in my teen years, I'd ask him about it a lot. Usually after he'd it just reminded me once more to look away and walk away, calm as can be. And he'd always tell me it was important that I remembered what he told me, but that if I knew too much that it'd be bad. Now that call can be heard on the first Mirrorman special season 7, episode 15 and was read by the talented Warren Pon Abbott. I haven't heard from Warren in a while. If you're listening, Warren, how you doing, buddy? So if our caller story isn't fabricated and is based on existing lore, that means a lot to this legend, because that would suggest that an older generation might know of this phenomena, perhaps by another name or no name at all. Which gives me an idea. Now, podcasting for the most part only reaches the younger generations. Most of my listeners fall somewhere between 25 and 45, which means that I'm missing a huge swath of people and possibly a good bit of information. So here is where you come in. If you have grandparents or even great grandparents still living, please take a moment to ask them about three strange men that look alike and move alike. Say no more than that. We wouldn't want to lead the witness too much. Just see if their eyes light up. Get whatever information you can and be sure to report back if you should get a hit. Now I'm going to say it's going to be awfully unsettling if we do get any connections back, so I guess we better watch what we wish for. But I'm hopeful that some additional information might trickle in. So I'm going to put a quirk in it right here. And I think this little social experiment will go a long way in unearthing any existing lore that might be out there forgotten for decades. And we thank you caller for this bizarre and ominous entry. An entry that gives us an opportunity to ask a few questions. Just brace yourself for the answers. Thanks again caller for sharing. This episode is brought to you by Progressive Insurance.

Some are making their way to the nearest body of water. Some swimming, some boating, maybe a little fishing or kayaking or even just a day at the beach. But I bet that a majority of you out there never give any thought to what might be hiding below, lurking beneath the murky water or hidden beyond the next frothy wave. Well, if Kat's story is to be believed, it sounds like you ought to be very, very worried. From the beaches of Southern California, please welcome Kat to the program. Hi, this is Kat again. I have a story from when I was three or four years old. I haven't heard it mentioned yet. The cryptid. We were, me, my brother, sister, my parents, we were in a church retreat that was set on the beaches in California. We were in Southern California at the time and it was supposed to be a four day retreat. Because of this happening, it was actually cut down to two days. Me and another little kid, we were with a parent and we were doing the classic chase the waves away from the beach and then run back away from the waves. You know, kids stuff, just playing tag with the waves. At one point there was something that came up in the waves. I call this my mermaid story. I know sounds crazy, but this thing that came up out of the water, it was fairly large to my four year old eyes, half human, half whatever it could be called, I suppose. It had green scales over its entire body. The head was globe shaped like not human, you know, oval shape, but it was circular and its arms were kind of squat like an alligator almost. We sat there staring at this thing as it came out of the water and just sat there on the beach looking at us and it smiled at us like ear to ear grin with these sharp pointing teeth. And we all screamed and ran and hours later everyone just left the beach. I've thought, you know, maybe it was an alligator, maybe you were just seeing things. But I've never heard of alligators being on Southern California beaches. I honestly don't know what it was. This was some odd 32 years ago showing my age, but I'm just wondering if anyone else has heard or encountered something similar to what I encountered just on the Southern California beaches, on any beach. Honestly, I. Like I said, it's my youngest encounter story that I've ever had happened to me. Anyways, I'm sorry love, love the podcast. I keep listening to it going down the road, pitch black outside, freaking myself out. Love it. Thank you so much for listening to my story. If you have any suggestions as to what it was or anyone else, I would love to hear it. Thank you. Goodbye. Thank you, Kat. You see, nonsense like that is what keeps me out of motion. Most bodies of water, though. I have swam off the coast of SoCal numerous times, but maybe not anymore. And no cat. Yours is not the only quote, unquote mermaid call that I fielded here on the program. In season 10, episode three, I played a call out of Texas in which a fisherman saw a turtle transform into a well mermaid while fishing in the Gulf of Mexico. Now, here was a brief excerpt of that call describing the creature in question. But it had arms, long arms. And the face, man, the face was just, you know, like I said, it was about 10 foot down, it was clear, so I could see a lot. You know, I could see it pretty vividly. The face was just kind of a. I want to say, like a bluish green color. I mean, it was kind of that coloration and it was just odd. Actually, later on, whenever I was at home, you know, just a couple months later, whenever it was, my wife was watching Harry Potter, and I think it's one of the latter films of Harry Potter, and they had the Bad Wizard. The face of that wizard looked almost identical to this face. It stopped me in my tracks. Whenever I was kind of walking by and glanced over the tv, I was just like, that's it. That's what it is. You had little slits in the nose. You had just this weird reptilian face. And the hair was kind of a. Dark matted type of hair. It was just very odd. Very, very odd. Now, you can find the full call on season 10, episode 3, but as similar as these two descriptions are, I actually have a third call that's even more relevant. And I usually like to spread these calls out just to keep things from being repetitive, but the following call was too much like the previous two not to put in a package. So from the opposite side of the country, please welcome RB from the Commonwealth of Virginia. Hey, Derek. I'm going to stay anonymous, but you can call me RB I found you her podcast, probably two to three months after this occurrence. Wasn't really into these podcasts or anything, but when something happens, you start to look around to figure out, you know, what other people are seeing and what things might be. I'm in very, very rural Virginia, but I'm on the waters of the Chesapeake Bay. You can take one look at the bay and you'll see that there's all kinds of finger rivers and everything like that. I don't want to say exactly where this took place, but let's just say it was very rural fishing, farming community. So it's like I said, occurred probably September or October of last year. 22. I'm an avid kayaker, retired military, spend a lot of time overseas. Never seen anything like this. So I'm in my kayak and I've got my dog with me. He's a very probably 100 pound, 110 pound German Shepherd. And we're out. I've paddled way up a river at a tributary to the point where I am pretty much in the wilderness. No more houses, no more docks. You know, left that probably a half mile mile ago. And I'm just in kind of fingers of the, you know, saltwater. But I'm in the wilderness. I'm surrounded by trees and hills and stuff and you know, marsh grass of course, that kind of thing. We've been out probably half hour, 45 minutes, something like that. And I decided to take the kayak as far up as I could go and do a little bit fishing there, you know, before you start hitting the areas where it's more fresh than salt and you're trying to just kind of see how you can far you can go and see what kind of fish you might be able to catch, that kind of thing. So I kind of came to the end of as far as I was going to get in my boat. Probably was high tide at the time. But the reason I stopped is clearly the. The river ended but the water is still probably. I have no idea deep where I'm at in the center and I'm just sitting there fishing. It's getting close to dusk. You know, you're in that pretty golden hour. It's fall, trees are beautiful. This guy's pretty and just kind of dozing off, you know, thinking to yourself about whatever you think about when you're chilling fishing. I might have even dozed off and my dog starts barking fanatically. And he's a real calm boy, doesn't do this kind of stuff. Kind of knocks me out of my wall and I start looking around. He's barking at the water. I just glance back and I look down and there is this thing looking back at me. Humanoid for sure. Looks like a reptile. Almost like after doing some, some research that I don't really know that he. I mean, I guess you could say it was a mercury, but I mean if mermaids are full on evil beings at this thing, I'll try to describe it for you. I found some research and saw something in Japan called the kappa. It kind of looked more like that Than anything. Only I say that because this thing kind of looked like a turtle. Other than. I mean, the eyes were wrong, the face was wrong, skin was right. Didn't really have a nose. A greenish, brownish, dark skin. It looked very, very reptile. But the eyes. The eyes had. They were snake eyes, that yellow diamond slit about as far apart as you see on any person. They look intelligent and evil at the same time. And I could see its mouth. Lips were kind of pursed, but you could see just through. And you could see a like bro. A sharp teeth, almost like you would see on, like a fish or something. Man, it must have been like a hair away from the surface. Like. Like you're about to. You're. You say you've been swimming and you're about to. Underwater and you're about to come up, but stop. This thing was. I could have touched it. It was just below the water line at the head, the nose, and I couldn't. The water's brackish, dark. I couldn't see beyond the shoulders, but I saw it. It burned into my mind. For some reason, I got a feeling that this thing may have been female, if that's even possible. I don't know. It just may be the way the neck and shoulders were more feminine, even though it was like, if that makes sense. I don't know. By the time you would get to where I could tell by the shape of the shoulders and the neck. And you lost visibility after that. Now, that said, I'm giving as much detail as I can. This. This was quick. This was quick because I was scared. I got scared real quick. And then I saw on the surface. It was ridiculous. It was almost like an 80s horror movie, like. Like where they put piranhas in the lake or something. I think there was one like that. And I saw water. Like little. You know, when something's moving under the water, you see the. It coming towards you from seven different places. I could make out things coming my direction. Now that said they could have just been minnows on the surface. They, you know, that's probably what it was. I don't know. The way my dog was freaking out, what I saw. I just probably turned white and I began to paddle for my life as fast as I could to get out of there. Two coves later, the ripples quit following our direction and just kind of disappeared. Yeah, I guess that's pretty much the end of the story. I wouldn't go anywhere near that body of water for months. Been back close to it since once or twice, you know, probably in the beginning of the spring of the summer. I just kind of stay away from the area now. Yeah, that's it. That's my story. Some kind of mirth thing in the tide waters of the Chesapeake. Yeah, I just. To this day I still don't know what I saw, but it scared the heck out of me. And it makes you have a little bit more appreciation for what's below because we just. You never know. All right, have a good one. Bye. That's right, rb, you never know what's down there. Thank you for calling in. And that's the trifecta, folks. In my opinion, all three are describing the exact same creature. If you don't believe me, I made a little chart and listened to each call. All three mentioned that the creature came out of the water, salt water. All three mentioned that it reminded them of a mermaid. All three described the creature's color as greenish. And all three described strange or odd shaped arms. And all seemed to be describing something reptil. Now, both RB's and cats stories detailed sharp teeth as well, a few other attributes that were shared among the group. So now that we have a bit of a description, let's analyze this creature just a little bit further. Now, if this were the only account, I tried to suggest some rare animal might be at fault. A manatee, a seal, a seldom seen fish. In fact, when I originally shared the call from Texas, I suspected it might have been a blanket octopus. Now I'm not so sure. And before I forget to mention it, RB brought up Japan's kappa. Now, coincidentally, we covered that creature back on season 11, episode one in the Waterworker special. And I've also linked to a brief documentary on the subject in the show notes. If you're not familiar, go take a look. But that's in Japan. That's not Texas, California or Virginia. But three people essentially seen the same thing in separate parts of this massive country. That's gotta mean something, right? And all three describe their encounters in very similar ways. And the circumstances in which the witness found themselves were very similar as well. And you would think that that would be enough for me to make some sort of correlation. But for the life of me, I could not find any real connection to the ocean, sea or any body of salt water for that matter. And what can only be described as a lizard man. Sure, there are plenty of anecdotal stories out there. The skateboard swamp lizard man of South Carolina instantly comes to mind. But that's quite obviously not salt water. While I did come up dry in my search for a marine humanoid reptile, I did however, find a story out of rural Mexico that I think is at least similar enough to share with you here tonight. It's a report I found on Phantoms and Monsters, a website that shares written first hand accounts with experiencers of the strange and the bizarre. The report begins with a storyteller talking about seeing white crosses all around the lake near where they lived in Ameca, Jalisco, Mexico. When asked, they were told that those all represented people that had drowned in the lake recently. Apparently many people mysteriously died, some even claiming to be pulled under as they went down, and many of the bodies were not recovered. Then the storyteller shares a story they heard from their uncle about what might be taking the victims down. And coincidentally, my buddies down in Texas Expanded Perspectives podcast just covered this very story last week and Kylie and Cam gave me the go ahead to share part of it with you here tonight. So this is the tale our storyteller's uncle shared, courtesy of Expanded Perspectives. Now this is my uncle's story. After knowing that I was asking many questions about what was going on with the lake, he told me something that happened to his friend when they were teenagers. He said that his friend had invited him to go fishing at night because that's when fish are more accessible to catch since they get close to the edge. He told him no because my grandma had grounded him. Later that night, after midnight, my uncle heard banging on the door and the doors out there were made of metal so it shook them pretty bad. Now my grandma and uncle got up and my uncle got up and went to the door and opened a little window on the door to see who it was. It was his friend, wide eyed and and pale. My uncle asked him if he was all right. He said he looked like a ghost and my grandma told him to bring him inside. They sat him down, calmed him down and asked him what happened, where was he coming from? He told him that he went to the lake alone on his bike with his fishing gear and was out there camping hoping to get some fish. But he wasn't having any luck after a couple of hours, so he decided to leave. He was on the other side of the lake so he had to go around. It was a bright night so that he could see the dirt road. He was going around the lake when he saw something come out of the other side where he was going. At first he didn't pay much attention to it, thinking it was a turtle or perhaps a giant iguana that roamed around Those parts, they grow to about 3ft or 4ft long and look even bigger when it's in the dark. So he was riding along, looking over to see this thing come out on all fours. He saw how it had wet skin and it was shining due to the moonlight and how it had a short reptilian tail. The best he could describe it was as if it had a stump of a tail, but it was wide and odd looking. He couldn't tell if it had a neck. It looked stocky from its upper body. He was just looking at how huge this lizard was that just came out of the lake when all of a sudden it stood upright on its rear legs. That's when he got scared because he could tell it was big. He estimated to be about 2 meters or 6 foot 7 inches. He made a noise and this thing turned around and looked at him. It had big, big red eyes. To be able to tell they were red. From his distance, he knew they had to be large. And he was about 20 meters away. He started pedaling hard with all of his fear because to top it off, this creature was downhill from the only road that led him out from the lake. And it was just staring at him, following him with its stare. As soon as he was parallel to the creature, he gunned it down the road and didn't look back until he got to my grandma's house, which was closer than his house, just five minutes away from the lake on a bike. He stayed over and left the next day, still shocked. I really enjoy their program and I suspect that you will as well when you finish this episode. Be sure to check expanded perspectives out. And thank you, Kyle and Cam for allowing me to share that clip. Now, this isn't even the strange part of the report. For that we go back to the Phantoms and Monsters article where our storyteller shares that after hearing the uncle's story, they did some research and discovered the following information pulled directly from the Phantoms and Monsters website. I came across this legend a few months after my uncle told me his story and left me stunned because it was too much of a coincidence with everything I had heard by then. The legend takes place in a Mecca, Jalisco, Mexico and it's about a fisherman named Lucio who was struggling to provide for his family and made a deal with the devil. He found gold soon after, but got paranoid with time and thought his family was just with him for the gold. Since the day he had made the deal, he was always carrying around a snake. So one day he took his gold and Snake and the people in the town saw him jump over a bridge into the river and never saw him again. The legend goes that he got transformed into this lizard like monster with big scaly skin, big yellow eyes, small tail, and he is the cause of people drowning in that river and the waters that connect the town's rivers. The town I was living in is only 30 minutes away from there. It's not exactly salt water, but too many similar details to ignore. So keep all this in mind the next time you find yourself in a body of water. That unshakable feeling that you're being watched from the depths below might not just be your imagination. I truly pity anyone that's listening to this while floating on a raft, any lake, river or God forbid, the Ocean. Keep all 10 toes and 10 fingers of the above the waterline if you want to keep them. And folks, that's going to do it for this evening. A huge thanks to everyone that's tuned in, and an even bigger thanks to those that toughen out to the true end of the program, and an enormous thanks to tonight's callers.

This is the professor. Now folks. Tonight's secret entry also calls back to a previous call from a past episode. Stephanie from Florida, welcome to the show. Hello Monsters Among Us. This is Stephanie from the Tampa area, but my call is in reference to a small town in Michigan called Grass Lake, Michigan. First, a little disclaimer. I began listening to Monsters among us last year 2022 and worked my way all the way through through till the current season. But I got excited when I first heard a call from season six from Jeff regarding his little son talking about the grandmas lined up in the graveyard. Anyways, fast forward to today, which I've become a Patreon and I'm listening to episode 43 in Wiguli. Referenced that episode from season six as well. So here's my story. In 2021 I was living with my father in his house, caring for him while he was suffering from pretty severe dementia, coming close to the end stages of Alzheimer's. But for a break, my brother would come and take my dad out every now and then, or my sister. And in this occasion my brother took him up to the grocery store in our small town and on the way back we Passed a cemetery, the local cemetery, cemetery. And my father said, hey, what are all those people over there doing? They're all lined up to get out of there. So it was kind of spooky at the time. And then afterwards, when I heard the story that Jeff said with his son saying the same thing, it really kind of was pretty eerie. The interesting thing to me about this also is that my brother at the time was living in a house that had some, you know, kind of unexplained occurrences. And for a while the year prior, my dad had lived with him and he used to say, hey, little girl, come out of there. Come over here. Hey, look at that little girl over there. So I'm just curious to see maybe what he saw. A lot of people talk about dementia patients, Alzheimer's patients having delusions and think they see things, but maybe they really are seeing something we don't. Anyway, keep up the good work. I love the show and love spooky things. Thank you. Thank you, Stephanie. Of course, she's referring to Jeff's call out of Ohio in which his little boy saw a bunch of older people standing around a cemetery. By far one of my favorite calls. Well, you know, it's well known that dementia sufferers can experience hallucinations, especially those suffering from lewd body dementia, delusions that often manifest in the form of rodents or small animals or even groups of people trying to gain entry into their home. I suppose both could be terrifying in their own way. But these hallucinations are limited to those two categories, making it possible that what Stephanie's father saw was simply that, a hallucination. Then again, if it's not some sort of delusion, perhaps that disease opens one eye when it closes another, giving them the ability to see to the other side, another realm, another dimension, a view that we don't share. Well, thank you again, Stephanie, for sharing your story here with us. Now, folks, stick with me as we transition to the beyond.

I used to work at IT for our local county for about five years and a lot of our offices were in the really old buildings on our square One of the main buildings that we had a lot of equipment in was called the Opera House. And it used to be just that, it used to be an opera house. So I was in there late one night working on some network equipment. We do a lot of after hours hours work to avoid disrupting business hours. And I was in the basement and this basement was really strange. It almost looked like it was carved out of a cave, but it was just really old plastic walls that had begun to warp for me. But I was in the basement and I was working on the switch and I start to hear music, orchestral music. It's really faint, really quiet. And I know that the treasurer's office, which was above me, they like to play music during the day. They had speakers in the building. So I think, well, maybe they left the music on or something. And as I go up the stairs, it keeps a constant volume, it doesn't get any louder. So I go upstairs and I walk around the treasurer's office and constant music, flat volume all the way across. Kind of quiet, kind of distant. And that's about it. Thank you much.",

      "text": "Thanks, Zach. And sorry about the mix up with your entry. When you receive thousands of calls per year, it happens from time to time anyway. I think that's exactly the sort of activity one would expect in an old opera house. In fact, I think it would be more concerning if phantom music wasn't heard any place like that. It's almost that expected now, being there alone in the dark when said activity begins to occur, expected or not, it's gonna freak you right out. So a big thanks to Zach for sharing that entry. Now, if you're like Zach and you too have a story you would like to share here on the program, a true story, call the hotline at 888-608-NIGHT. That's 888608 NIG HT. A couple of ground rules that will ensure your story gets played. Do not call from a moving vehicle. A quiet room is always the best place. Please finish your story. I can't tell you how many people have called in with an amazing story, but they use up their five minutes and never call back to finish. So I'm left with the first half. And finally, one story per call, please. It's a bit of a nightmare when there is more than one story per call. Thus those typically get skipped over because they take extra time. So if you saw Bigfoot, a ghost and a ufo, but it wasn't all on the same day, those are separate calls. You can call them in the Same day, just make them different phone calls for my sanity. And I know many of you are patiently waiting to hear your story, so perhaps these little guidelines will help you get your story on the airwaves quicker. Now, next up, we venture to the Pacific Northwest to cover the topic you'd expect us to cover in such a location. Tony from Oregon. You talking about Bigfoot?",

And while he's getting ready and stuff, these shrieking sounds like. Like a cow, elk, and a coyote trying to shriek together. Mixture sounded. And there's like four or five of them. Yeah, yeah.

Last Wednesday, I believe it was January 17th, I was heading to work at approximately 7:20 and as I'm driving south towards Highway 121, I noticed there were three brightly lit orange lights hovering above the freeway or in that vicinity. They were in a very, very bright amber orange. I thought maybe they were planes that were coming towards me, but they never moved as I was continuing my drive south. And they were positioned diagonally in the sky. So, you know, we had one that was over to the left and the middle one was more to the right. Of course, the bottom one was, was further to the right or to the east. Then what it started to do was the top one went west and then the bottom one went right. And I kept on thinking, well, maybe these are drones doing some sort of survey. Like I was saying that the lights were extremely bright, very orange. One thing I didn't I noticed that I couldn't see any, any navigation lights. So I never saw any kind of like red or green lights on these lights. And I didn't see any kind of like flashing stroke. If you're ever driving around the Dallas area at night between like 7pm and 9pm we have two major airports around here. And you see all kinds of planes flying around, all kinds of commercial jets and they're very noticeable. You see their landing light, you see their hazard light. You know Their navigation lights with red and green lights, you see a blinking strobe light many times. These had none of those characteristics. They were just three bright orange lights hovering over the area of Frisco and Plano city lines. As I got closer to them, it appeared that they had moved around to different parts of the the area. I don't know what they were. Maybe they were just drones doing some sort of surveillance or survey. I was just wondering if anybody else had saw them because they were very noticeable. All right, love your podcast. Thanks for all you do. Have a good one.",

Yeah, I would have to believe so with the picture I took with the black triangular shape underneath the lights, it's definitely not any type of like flare illumination rounds or anything. So this was a craft. Was it hovering? Stationary? Was there any sound? There was absolutely no sound. No sound, but it was definitely stationary. How big was it? Estimate to me, how big compared to one of those stealth bombers, the size? Well, hold on, hold on. Stealth bombers can't hover. Exactly. That's why I can compare it to that.

At approximately nine in the evening, Betty Cash and Vicki Landrum and a seven year old boy, Colby Landrum, are driving home to Dayton. On Hoffman New Caney Road, 30 miles northeast of Houston. The boy sees a bright light in the sky heading straight towards them. This light will soon irreparably impact the lives of everyone in the car. The light descends and reveals itself to be a diamond shaped object. All of the occupants in the car feel strong heat and the two women are burned. Possibly as many as 23 double rotor military helicopters arrive on the scene and circle the craft. Though the object and helicopters eventually disappear over the tree line. For the three in the car, an ordeal which will haunt them for the rest of their lives has just begun. But the effects of this incident linger on. Both women suffer mysterious injuries years later. According to their families, their deaths are caused by the incident.",

Now Betty died 18 years to the day of her sighting back in 1998 and Vicki passed away in 2007. And while we were researching this story, I stumbled upon something I'd never heard of before. It was the original report Vicki Landrum made to the National UFO Reporting Center, A UFO reporting hotline that's been in existence for a long, long time. Well, the recording made back in 1981 wasn't exactly easy to listen to, but I ran it through a few filters and managed to make it presentable. And since this is a show made up of first hand accounts, I thought it might be fitting to share part of her report here tonight.

I've had a lot, but most recently down my hallway there has been like this heavy energy. Like I don't want to be around it. So I try to clean it as quick as possible. Well, one night I go home and one of my family members told me if I could cleanse the house like I normally do because they saw the night before a bouncing green ball of light in the bathroom. And I said okay. And so I cleansed the house and we had investigated and there was no way a green ball of light could have been there. We didn't have anything plugged in and the way the curtain is, it's against the wall completely so no light could go in. Well, the day I had cleansed the house, I had asked whatever was there to please go back or move on. And I tried to be as polite as possible. I go to work and all of a sudden all of my equipment starts falling over. Every time I set something down, it falls over my vacuum on the floor and normally I grab it, drop the cord to the floor, and unless there's a tangle, which there wasn't, it won't fall. Well, later that night, it's dark, I'm alone. I decided to go clean windows in that side of the building where that heavy energy was. And it was more intense this time. And I walked down in one of the wagons that they like to drag the kids around in, you know, to the playground. It moved and it squeaked like someone had pulled the handle. And the wagon was in this room that I know for sure it was not in there before when I cleaned. And mind you, all the staff on that side of the building leave well before I get down there. So that's my story for right now. Thank you for listening. I hope you can use this and I'll call back with some more stories.",

Not because I got to skip out on all that hard work, although I doubt it would be missing much of it, but rather because it would put me alone in a potentially haunted building each and every work night. My imagination is just too good. I already know I'll find ways to creep myself out. But I have been in similar territory though. I worked for a student security program in college and part of my duties was to lock various administrative buildings there on campus at like 11pm or midnight. I don't remember. It was too long ago, but it was dark. And that's the point. And you know, some of those places were nearly 100 years old at the time. You could literally feel the energy flowing out of some of these spaces. Or maybe that was just my imagination again. Anyway, any small way I sort of get where Brad is coming from here. And let me say, those are not fun shoes to be in, but we do. Thank you Brad for sharing your nervousness with us and please do let us know if anything else strange occurs there.

I was dating this girl who was a practicing Wiccan. Like, her mother practiced it, and I think her grandma did too. So it's kind of a thing. I wasn't really big into it, but it didn't bother me none. I remember it was summertime, thinking, like 2004, 5, I don't remember. And we were going to stop by one of her friend's house. It was like late afternoon. So I drove her to her friend's house. I think her friend also was practicing Wicca. So we stopped by our friend's house and the two go upstairs. They said they had something to do. And so, like, no boys allowed or whatever. So I hung out downstairs. No one was in the house. The apartment was empty. So I'm sitting in the living room and I just decide to lay down on her couch. So laying on the couch to have my back to the living room and where I was laying at, I could look through this. There's a picture of their family, family portrait. And on the glass of the picture frame, it kind of reflected the room behind me because the light was coming in. So I kind of lay there for a second, closed my eyes, felt weird for a second, felt like somebody entered the room and opened my eyes. And through that picture frame, that glass behind me, I saw a shadow standing in the doorway of the front door. My first thought was, oh, her dad came home. Or brother, older brother or something. This tall figure. I immediately thought it was a male. And it was just standing there. So it kind of freaked me out. So I played dead, just kind of laid there. I'm gonna act like I'm gonna sleep. And the figure just continued to stand there and stare at me, which freaked me out. Hadn't for a couple of minutes, I just stared at it. It stared at me. Then I heard the girls coming downstairs. You could hear them coming down the steps. I counted to like 1, 2, then turned around, act like I woke up to meet this person. And no one was there, not a soul. Two girls came down, looked at me. They could see my confused look on my face and they said what's the matter? And I looked at them and said what did you do? And they just giggled and we left. Nothing more was said. I never brought it back up. I don't know if they were asking for something to stop by or I was getting watched, who knows, but there was definitely something there watching me lay on that girl's couch. I don't know. Weird story. Definitely Love the podcast. Keep knocking them out. Love listen to the episodes. Thanks.",

And if I'm understanding correctly, it's Alonzo's theory that this girlfriend, whom is a serious Wiccan practitioner, somehow manifested this entity in her own home. I don't know, I'd probably be more into religion if it produced results like this. No one mentioned to me that you can conjure up monsters. But in all seriousness, I wonder if there is a connection there or if this is all just one big coincidence. An eerie one, but a coincidence nonetheless. But I'll keep my ears open, Alonzo, to see if any other Shadow man stories mention Wiccan or any other religion for that matter. It just might be onto something.

And this warehouse was right next to an abandoned train station called the Rock Island Train Station. You can look it up online. I believe it's been refurbished. Beautiful old building, but it was completely dilapidated, abandoned, and it backed up to a rail yard and the river warehouse district, which at the time was completely abandoned and very sketchy. Dangerous area. I worked overnights at this warehouse with a bunch of really interesting characters. And one night we were sitting on the loading dock on a summer evening. There was not much going on. 3 o' clock in the morning, and we saw some people over by the Rock Island Railroad station station, which was strange because even homeless folks would avoid it because you couldn't hardly walk through that area without getting covered in tar. And there were so many railroad tracks and debris that it was really, you know, not practical to walk through there, even to have a shortcut. It was just more trouble than it was worth. So it was strange to see someone over there at all. But it was three people, and they were all walking exactly right next to each other, the exact same height, build, and they were wearing very distinct outfits for the time. This was 1991, and hockey jerseys were kind of a fad at the time. Even though no one in Little Rock really watched hockey, you would sometimes see someone in a hockey jersey, and that's what I initially thought. Why would three people in hockey jerseys that were very clean be walking in this very dirty area? Very, very bad area to be by yourself this time of night, even with two friends. But as I looked closer, I realized their movements were exactly mirrored, like they were androids. There were four or five guys on the loading dock with me. We all noticed it and began talking about it. You know, who are these people? What are they doing? And the clothes stood out. The clothes were very green, kind of dark green and light green. Big sweaters. And this was a summer night in Little Rock, Arkansas. So it would have been in the 90s and humid. And they were wearing what looked like big corduroy pants that were light colored, like light color khaki. They just looked homemade kind of. They were far off. But you could tell that the clothes had a strange quality to them. You know, I had no idea what was going on, but I knew that it didn't look like homeless people or anyone else who would be in the area because it's a house district. If you weren't there to do newspaper business or a transient person living in an area where there's really nothing for those folks at all in terms of people or infrastructure or even a bathroom. So you really didn't see many people there. And it was really strange. As soon as we saw them, they were at kind of a strange angle. And they walked around the edge of the warehouse and then around the edge of the Rock island train station, abandoned in the distance. And I was the youngest guy there, and I said, well, I'm gonna go see what that was. And they all said, you know, don't go see what that is. No matter what it is, it's not worth going over there and potentially, you know, getting in a fight or getting robbed or something. But I was, you know, intent on it. And I went across the parking lot and through some weeds and around this abandoned turn of the century train station, and I saw a fire. A little campfire was built underneath the awning of the train station. And it was bright, it was very luminous. But I had not seen any light prior to that. And you would be able to see it would have lit up the entire train station, would make it all luminous. That light actually made the other guys from the warehouse come start to look for me. But this campfire, which was, you know, what I would describe as a very small campfire and a ring of stones on a broken piece of concrete. It was bright, like it had just sparked. And as I stood there looking at it, all I could think of was who had made this fire. I'm disturbing someone. Someone is in this immediate vicinity. So I should, you know, be aware of what's going on. Maybe that's who these people were. The next thing I knew, the fire without completely. And I was hearing my name being called, and I was feeling the cold wind of morning on my cheek, which, if you work outside overnight, there's a certain breeze that you feel right before sunrise. And you know, like, oh, hey, morning's coming. So I'm not quite sure what happened. I was standing in the exact same spot where I remember stopping. The guys from the warehouse came to look for me. They couldn't find me. They didn't see a campfire. They did see the light. That's why they came to look for me. So I had about an hour of missing time. It was about 3am this was maybe 4:35am that they found me. They were calling for me all. All across this big warehouse building. So I go back to the warehouse, and the boss's elderly dad is there, and he would come down sometimes and just hang out with everybody who's kind of a salty old character. And he told me that those things were demonic. And he said that if you were to ever see three people walking in unison like that, that you would never look at them, never pursue them, and look the other way, go the other way. And he said that he had encountered them with his former business partner when they were young men. And this. This man was very old and he's passed on many years ago now. He said he had encountered them in central Arkansas in what would have been the 1950s with his friend out in the field. And they had a similar experience where they went around the edge of a barn and had lost time later that week. His friend was a race car driver, and he was the race car mechanic. The engine that he worked on exploded and cut the man's legs off. He later ended up dying of the injuries. So my boss's father, who was telling me this story, blames himself for it. And he blamed the mirrored men. They cursed him. And so when I heard your podcast, you know, a few years ago, and you had given these characters a name and some. Some more, it really made my blood run cold because I have not shared this with anyone, and I'm sure that that old man has not shared that story with many people because he was very upset telling the story you could tell. He did not want to talk about race cars or engines. And he had told me a thousand stories. So, anyway, I love the show. Keep up the good work. Thanks very much.",

      "text": "Thank you, caller. Now, if I were the abbreviating type, I'd label this one as a cmms, a classic mirrored men story, because all the elements are there. It seems to be in a rural setting. There are three beings, all identical, all moving in unison. The entities look strange, unusual, particular enough that our caller saw it fit to investigate further. And of course, there was missing time involved. The only element that seems to be missing here is the odd or inclement weather, though our caller did mention that it was very hot and very humid that day back in 1991, but that's probably not all that unusual for that part of the country, but it's enough to convince me that this experience does fall under the mirroredmen umbrella. Note to self New merch idea Mirrored Men Umbrellas now, identifying a mirrored min story is easy. Explaining it is something else altogether. I'm just as confused and intrigued now as I was when I first heard one of these stories some 20 years ago. And I should point out that yet again, we have knowledge or past information presented by an old timer, someone we assume had a prior run in with these mysterious men. The first time we heard the warnings of look away and walk away was in an email sent in by a listener named Kent. Here's a snippet of the information Kent's grandfather bestowed upon him in regards to this terrifying trio.",

If you're listening, Warren, how you doing, buddy? So if our caller story isn't fabricated and is based on existing lore, that means a lot to this legend, because that would suggest that an older generation might know of this phenomena, perhaps by another name or no name at all. Which gives me an idea. Now, podcasting for the most part only reaches the younger generations. Most of my listeners fall somewhere between 25 and 45, which means that I'm missing a huge swath of people and possibly a good bit of information. So here is where you come in. If you have grandparents or even great grandparents still living, please take a moment to ask them about three strange men that look alike and move alike. Say no more than that. We wouldn't want to lead the witness too much. Just see if their eyes light up. Get whatever information you can and be sure to report back if you should get a hit. Now I'm going to say it's going to be awfully unsettling if we do get any connections back, so I guess we better watch what we wish for. But I'm hopeful that some additional information might trickle in. So I'm going to put a quirk in it right here. And I think this little social experiment will go a long way in unearthing any existing lore that might be out there forgotten for decades. And we thank you caller for this bizarre and ominous entry. An entry that gives us an opportunity to ask a few questions. Just brace yourself for the answers. Thanks again caller for sharing. This episode is brought to you by Progressive Insurance.

We were, me, my brother, sister, my parents, we were in a church retreat that was set on the beaches in California. We were in Southern California at the time and it was supposed to be a four day retreat. Because of this happening, it was actually cut down to two days. Me and another little kid, we were with a parent and we were doing the classic chase the waves away from the beach and then run back away from the waves. You know, kids stuff, just playing tag with the waves. At one point there was something that came up in the waves. I call this my mermaid story. I know sounds crazy, but this thing that came up out of the water, it was fairly large to my four year old eyes, half human, half whatever it could be called, I suppose. It had green scales over its entire body. The head was globe shaped like not human, you know, oval shape, but it was circular and its arms were kind of squat like an alligator almost. We sat there staring at this thing as it came out of the water and just sat there on the beach looking at us and it smiled at us like ear to ear grin with these sharp pointing teeth. And we all screamed and ran and hours later everyone just left the beach. I've thought, you know, maybe it was an alligator, maybe you were just seeing things. But I've never heard of alligators being on Southern California beaches. I honestly don't know what it was. This was some odd 32 years ago showing my age, but I'm just wondering if anyone else has heard or encountered something similar to what I encountered just on the Southern California beaches, on any beach. Honestly, I. Like I said, it's my youngest encounter story that I've ever had happened to me. Anyways, I'm sorry love, love the podcast. I keep listening to it going down the road, pitch black outside, freaking myself out. Love it. Thank you so much for listening to my story. If you have any suggestions as to what it was or anyone else, I would love to hear it. Thank you. Goodbye.",

      "text": "Hey, Derek. I'm going to stay anonymous, but you can call me RB I found you her podcast, probably two to three months after this occurrence. Wasn't really into these podcasts or anything, but when something happens, you start to look around to figure out, you know, what other people are seeing and what things might be. I'm in very, very rural Virginia, but I'm on the waters of the Chesapeake Bay. You can take one look at the bay and you'll see that there's all kinds of finger rivers and everything like that. I don't want to say exactly where this took place, but let's just say it was very rural fishing, farming community. So it's like I said, occurred probably September or October of last year. 22. I'm an avid kayaker, retired military, spend a lot of time overseas. Never seen anything like this. So I'm in my kayak and I've got my dog with me. He's a very probably 100 pound, 110 pound German Shepherd. And we're out. I've paddled way up a river at a tributary to the point where I am pretty much in the wilderness. No more houses, no more docks. You know, left that probably a half mile mile ago. And I'm just in kind of fingers of the, you know, saltwater. But I'm in the wilderness. I'm surrounded by trees and hills and stuff and you know, marsh grass of course, that kind of thing. We've been out probably half hour, 45 minutes, something like that. And I decided to take the kayak as far up as I could go and do a little bit fishing there, you know, before you start hitting the areas where it's more fresh than salt and you're trying to just kind of see how you can far you can go and see what kind of fish you might be able to catch, that kind of thing. So I kind of came to the end of as far as I was going to get in my boat. Probably was high tide at the time. But the reason I stopped is clearly the. The river ended but the water is still probably. I have no idea deep where I'm at in the center and I'm just sitting there fishing. It's getting close to dusk. You know, you're in that pretty golden hour. It's fall, trees are beautiful. This guy's pretty and just kind of dozing off, you know, thinking to yourself about whatever you think about when you're chilling fishing. I might have even dozed off and my dog starts barking fanatically. And he's a real calm boy, doesn't do this kind of stuff. Kind of knocks me out of my wall and I start looking around. He's barking at the water. I just glance back and I look down and there is this thing looking back at me. Humanoid for sure. Looks like a reptile. Almost like after doing some, some research that I don't really know that he. I mean, I guess you could say it was a mercury, but I mean if mermaids are full on evil beings at this thing, I'll try to describe it for you. I found some research and saw something in Japan called the kappa. It kind of looked more like that Than anything. Only I say that because this thing kind of looked like a turtle. Other than. I mean, the eyes were wrong, the face was wrong, skin was right. Didn't really have a nose. A greenish, brownish, dark skin. It looked very, very reptile. But the eyes. The eyes had. They were snake eyes, that yellow diamond slit about as far apart as you see on any person. They look intelligent and evil at the same time. And I could see its mouth. Lips were kind of pursed, but you could see just through. And you could see a like bro. A sharp teeth, almost like you would see on, like a fish or something. Man, it must have been like a hair away from the surface. Like. Like you're about to. You're. You say you've been swimming and you're about to. Underwater and you're about to come up, but stop. This thing was. I could have touched it. It was just below the water line at the head, the nose, and I couldn't. The water's brackish, dark. I couldn't see beyond the shoulders, but I saw it. It burned into my mind. For some reason, I got a feeling that this thing may have been female, if that's even possible. I don't know. It just may be the way the neck and shoulders were more feminine, even though it was like, if that makes sense. I don't know. By the time you would get to where I could tell by the shape of the shoulders and the neck. And you lost visibility after that. Now, that said, I'm giving as much detail as I can. This. This was quick. This was quick because I was scared. I got scared real quick. And then I saw on the surface. It was ridiculous. It was almost like an 80s horror movie, like. Like where they put piranhas in the lake or something. I think there was one like that. And I saw water. Like little. You know, when something's moving under the water, you see the. It coming towards you from seven different places. I could make out things coming my direction. Now that said they could have just been minnows on the surface. They, you know, that's probably what it was. I don't know. The way my dog was freaking out, what I saw. I just probably turned white and I began to paddle for my life as fast as I could to get out of there. Two coves later, the ripples quit following our direction and just kind of disappeared. Yeah, I guess that's pretty much the end of the story. I wouldn't go anywhere near that body of water for months. Been back close to it since once or twice, you know, probably in the beginning of the spring of the summer. I just kind of stay away from the area now. Yeah, that's it. That's my story. Some kind of mirth thing in the tide waters of the Chesapeake. Yeah, I just. To this day I still don't know what I saw, but it scared the heck out of me. And it makes you have a little bit more appreciation for what's below because we just. You never know. All right, have a good one. Bye.",

      "text": "That's right, rb, you never know what's down there. Thank you for calling in. And that's the trifecta, folks. In my opinion, all three are describing the exact same creature. If you don't believe me, I made a little chart and listened to each call. All three mentioned that the creature came out of the water, salt water. All three mentioned that it reminded them of a mermaid. All three described the creature's color as greenish. And all three described strange or odd shaped arms. And all seemed to be describing something reptil. Now, both RB's and cats stories detailed sharp teeth as well, a few other attributes that were shared among the group. So now that we have a bit of a description, let's analyze this creature just a little bit further. Now, if this were the only account, I tried to suggest some rare animal might be at fault. A manatee, a seal, a seldom seen fish. In fact, when I originally shared the call from Texas, I suspected it might have been a blanket octopus. Now I'm not so sure. And before I forget to mention it, RB brought up Japan's kappa. Now, coincidentally, we covered that creature back on season 11, episode one in the Waterworker special. And I've also linked to a brief documentary on the subject in the show notes. If you're not familiar, go take a look. But that's in Japan. That's not Texas, California or Virginia. But three people essentially seen the same thing in separate parts of this massive country. That's gotta mean something, right? And all three describe their encounters in very similar ways. And the circumstances in which the witness found themselves were very similar as well. And you would think that that would be enough for me to make some sort of correlation. But for the life of me, I could not find any real connection to the ocean, sea or any body of salt water for that matter. And what can only be described as a lizard man. Sure, there are plenty of anecdotal stories out there. The skateboard swamp lizard man of South Carolina instantly comes to mind. But that's quite obviously not salt water. While I did come up dry in my search for a marine humanoid reptile, I did however, find a story out of rural Mexico that I think is at least similar enough to share with you here tonight. It's a report I found on Phantoms and Monsters, a website that shares written first hand accounts with experiencers of the strange and the bizarre. The report begins with a storyteller talking about seeing white crosses all around the lake near where they lived in Ameca, Jalisco, Mexico. When asked, they were told that those all represented people that had drowned in the lake recently. Apparently many people mysteriously died, some even claiming to be pulled under as they went down, and many of the bodies were not recovered. Then the storyteller shares a story they heard from their uncle about what might be taking the victims down. And coincidentally, my buddies down in Texas Expanded Perspectives podcast just covered this very story last week and Kylie and Cam gave me the go ahead to share part of it with you here tonight. So this is the tale our storyteller's uncle shared, courtesy of Expanded Perspectives.",

      "text": "Now this is my uncle's story. After knowing that I was asking many questions about what was going on with the lake, he told me something that happened to his friend when they were teenagers. He said that his friend had invited him to go fishing at night because that's when fish are more accessible to catch since they get close to the edge. He told him no because my grandma had grounded him. Later that night, after midnight, my uncle heard banging on the door and the doors out there were made of metal so it shook them pretty bad. Now my grandma and uncle got up and my uncle got up and went to the door and opened a little window on the door to see who it was. It was his friend, wide eyed and and pale. My uncle asked him if he was all right. He said he looked like a ghost and my grandma told him to bring him inside. They sat him down, calmed him down and asked him what happened, where was he coming from? He told him that he went to the lake alone on his bike with his fishing gear and was out there camping hoping to get some fish. But he wasn't having any luck after a couple of hours, so he decided to leave. He was on the other side of the lake so he had to go around. It was a bright night so that he could see the dirt road. He was going around the lake when he saw something come out of the other side where he was going. At first he didn't pay much attention to it, thinking it was a turtle or perhaps a giant iguana that roamed around Those parts, they grow to about 3ft or 4ft long and look even bigger when it's in the dark. So he was riding along, looking over to see this thing come out on all fours. He saw how it had wet skin and it was shining due to the moonlight and how it had a short reptilian tail. The best he could describe it was as if it had a stump of a tail, but it was wide and odd looking. He couldn't tell if it had a neck. It looked stocky from its upper body. He was just looking at how huge this lizard was that just came out of the lake when all of a sudden it stood upright on its rear legs. That's when he got scared because he could tell it was big. He estimated to be about 2 meters or 6 foot 7 inches. He made a noise and this thing turned around and looked at him. It had big, big red eyes. To be able to tell they were red. From his distance, he knew they had to be large. And he was about 20 meters away. He started pedaling hard with all of his fear because to top it off, this creature was downhill from the only road that led him out from the lake. And it was just staring at him, following him with its stare. As soon as he was parallel to the creature, he gunned it down the road and didn't look back until he got to my grandma's house, which was closer than his house, just five minutes away from the lake on a bike. He stayed over and left the next day, still shocked.",

And thank you, Kyle and Cam for allowing me to share that clip. Now, this isn't even the strange part of the report. For that we go back to the Phantoms and Monsters article where our storyteller shares that after hearing the uncle's story, they did some research and discovered the following information pulled directly from the Phantoms and Monsters website. I came across this legend a few months after my uncle told me his story and left me stunned because it was too much of a coincidence with everything I had heard by then. The legend takes place in a Mecca, Jalisco, Mexico and it's about a fisherman named Lucio who was struggling to provide for his family and made a deal with the devil. He found gold soon after, but got paranoid with time and thought his family was just with him for the gold. Since the day he had made the deal, he was always carrying around a snake. So one day he took his gold and Snake and the people in the town saw him jump over a bridge into the river and never saw him again. The legend goes that he got transformed into this lizard like monster with big scaly skin, big yellow eyes, small tail, and he is the cause of people drowning in that river and the waters that connect the town's rivers. The town I was living in is only 30 minutes away from there. It's not exactly salt water, but too many similar details to ignore. So keep all this in mind the next time you find yourself in a body of water. That unshakable feeling that you're being watched from the depths below might not just be your imagination. I truly pity anyone that's listening to this while floating on a raft, any lake, river or God forbid, the Ocean. Keep all 10 toes and 10 fingers of the above the waterline if you want to keep them. And folks, that's going to do it for this evening. A huge thanks to everyone that's tuned in, and an even bigger thanks to those that toughen out to the true end of the program, and an enormous thanks to tonight's callers.

      "text": "Hello Monsters Among Us. This is Stephanie from the Tampa area, but my call is in reference to a small town in Michigan called Grass Lake, Michigan. First, a little disclaimer. I began listening to Monsters among us last year 2022 and worked my way all the way through through till the current season. But I got excited when I first heard a call from season six from Jeff regarding his little son talking about the grandmas lined up in the graveyard. Anyways, fast forward to today, which I've become a Patreon and I'm listening to episode 43 in Wiguli. Referenced that episode from season six as well. So here's my story. In 2021 I was living with my father in his house, caring for him while he was suffering from pretty severe dementia, coming close to the end stages of Alzheimer's. But for a break, my brother would come and take my dad out every now and then, or my sister. And in this occasion my brother took him up to the grocery store in our small town and on the way back we Passed a cemetery, the local cemetery, cemetery. And my father said, hey, what are all those people over there doing? They're all lined up to get out of there. So it was kind of spooky at the time. And then afterwards, when I heard the story that Jeff said with his son saying the same thing, it really kind of was pretty eerie. The interesting thing to me about this also is that my brother at the time was living in a house that had some, you know, kind of unexplained occurrences. And for a while the year prior, my dad had lived with him and he used to say, hey, little girl, come out of there. Come over here. Hey, look at that little girl over there. So I'm just curious to see maybe what he saw. A lot of people talk about dementia patients, Alzheimer's patients having delusions and think they see things, but maybe they really are seeing something we don't. Anyway, keep up the good work. I love the show and love spooky things. Thank you.",

      "text": "Thank you, Stephanie. Of course, she's referring to Jeff's call out of Ohio in which his little boy saw a bunch of older people standing around a cemetery. By far one of my favorite calls. Well, you know, it's well known that dementia sufferers can experience hallucinations, especially those suffering from lewd body dementia, delusions that often manifest in the form of rodents or small animals or even groups of people trying to gain entry into their home. I suppose both could be terrifying in their own way. But these hallucinations are limited to those two categories, making it possible that what Stephanie's father saw was simply that, a hallucination. Then again, if it's not some sort of delusion, perhaps that disease opens one eye when it closes another, giving them the ability to see to the other side, another realm, another dimension, a view that we don't share.
