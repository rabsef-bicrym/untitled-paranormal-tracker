2: [Speaker B] Sam.
3: [Speaker A] Good evening and welcome to Monsters Among Us. I'm your guide, Darren Case. It's good to be back with you here this evening folks. I have an awesome episode in store for you this evening. A little bit of everything here tonight and I'm not gonna waste any time in getting started. From the State of Arizona, please welcome Amra to tonight's program.
4: [Speaker B] Hi Derek, My name's Amra. I'm calling from Tucson, Arizona. I decided to call in after hearing somebody else tell a ghost tour story. This happened October of 2021 and I decided to invite my friend and her boyfriend to join me and my husband on the local ghost tour. We hadn't been and I thought it might be a fun idea to just learn about some of the history of the downtown area. But nothing too scary. I'm not into getting too scared, but just the spooky stuff. So we decided to meet them for dinner first just next to where the ghost tour begins. And just as an aside, this will be important later. I'm a psychologist, and I typically keep my cell phone on vibrate. I don't have the ringer on because I can't have it going off during sessions and disturbing things. And also, I'm very careful about emfs. So anytime I have my phone near me, like in my bag or in this case, in a fanny pack, I typically put it on airplane mode. And so my husband and I, you know, went to meet them at the restaurant. And before going in, I turned on my phone Just to see if there were any messages from my friend first. There weren't. And so I turned it back on airplane mode, and I was wearing a fanny pack this evening Just so I wouldn't have to carry a purse or anything like that on the walking tour. So kind of carefully made sure it was off in my bag, and we went in to meet them at dinner and then set off on the tour. Toward the end of the walking tour, we were downtown on congress street, which is one of the oldest streets in tucson, and we were standing across a small side street from the hotel congress, which is an old hotel from, I think, sometime in the 1800s. The tour guide was telling us the stories about different purported sightings and experiences that people typically have while working or staying at the hotel. And she finished her story. We started moving on to the next location. Went around the corner, heading toward the train station, when my fanny pack starts vibrating with the phone going off. And at first, I'm just annoyed because I'm thinking, I could have sworn I turned my phone onto airplane mode. I'm really good about that. And I remember doing it so it's loud and it's vibrating. And so I open the fanny pack, take the phone out, and it's also flashing. And I see that it's calling 91 1, and I panic because I don't want to be calling 91 1. Obviously, I'm on a tour. And so I hang up. Unfortunately, the call had gone through. So now 911 is desperately trying to reach me, Thinking that there's some emergency. And, you know, I'm whispering to the woman at 91 1, telling her that, no, everything is fine, really. You know, nobody's holding me against my will and telling me to say this. They finally believe me, and I put the phone onto airplane mode back in my bag, and we finished the tour. You know, thinking about this later, I'm like, okay, what was that? Because I am sure I turned it onto airplane mode. So I start Googling. You know, maybe even though I wasn't touching the bag, nothing new had happened, hitting the bag. Maybe there's some combination of buttons on an iPhone that you can press that activates emergency 911. Maybe somehow something happened and there was nothing abnormal about it. It just dialed out. Didn't find too much about that. And in any case, I realized in hindsight, my phone vibrates when I receive a call, not when I make a call. So I've got to wonder, you know, with all the stories about spirits being able to manipulate electronic devices, if maybe somebody wasn't trying to get my attention. And at first I thought, you know, oh, you're trying to get me in trouble with the police with 911. But, you know, in hindsight, I thought, you know what? Actually, I'm a psychologist, and, you know, maybe somebody really was just reaching out for help, and this was a symbolic way of conveying that. So that is my story. Thanks.
5: [Speaker A] Thank you, Amra. You know, a couple of summers ago, something similar happened to me. We'd been down at the lake all day, and suddenly I get a frantic call from both my mother and my dad because they'd somehow got an alert from my phone saying that I was in danger of some sort. I was not. I guess they're both on my emergency contacts list, and some button was pushed. At some point, they were alerted to the fact that I was in distress. Well, a couple of quick phone calls later, and everything was cleared up. But I'm really happy that the phone didn't actually call 911 like Amra's phone did. But I was not in a haunted location that I know of. Amra here was. She was outside the Hotel Congress. There, in the heart of downtown Tucson, a structure known to harbor a ghost or two. We know the first floor of the Hotel Congress for the fun and food. But when you go upstairs, you get a different type of chill.
6: [Speaker B] Trent Valadarez with the Hotel Congress, takes.
7: [Speaker A] Us on a tour of four haunted rooms, starting with room 214.
8: [Speaker B] So in this room, we have numerous reports of what we call our Victorian gentleman. So it's a gentleman dressed in a seersucker or pinstripe suit, top hat, dressed to the nines.
9: [Speaker A] He says many people have made reports from down in the plaza of that exact man looking through the window. And it gets spookier in room 212, just next door. He says many guests report the door rattling, opening and closing on its own as a whole.
10: [Speaker B] When you have a hotel that was built over 100 years ago.
11: [Speaker A] There are a lot of stories to tell in room 242 sightings of a.
12: [Speaker B] Woman in white had a woman that came to stay in the hotel and ended up staying for an extended stay. She was having a rough point in her life and with her marriage and was going through a separation and ultimately barricaded herself in here and unfortunately took her own life.
13: [Speaker A] He says. Guests have reported feeling a presence while sleeping and even say they've seen her sitting at the foot of the bed. The the last room 220 was home to a World War II veteran.
14: [Speaker B] This friend here in our hotel, because he seems to be quite playful, he likes to just kind of hide things and move things.
15: [Speaker A] Now that clip courtesy of KGUN ABC News 9 out of Tucson, and it does a great job of presenting much of the reported activity there at the hotel. Perhaps they should have added phantom 911 calls to their list of occurrences. Now there's another cool tidbit about the Congress Hotel. Notorious bank robber and gang leader John Dillinger was ambushed and captured by the FBI just outside its doors on January 25, 1934. So you can say that the place has all sorts of history recorded within its walls. So thank you again, Amra for taking the time to call in. Now folks, I have all kinds of creepiness to share with you this evening, so don't even think about going anywhere. I'll be right back. This episode is brought to you by Progressive Insurance.

Please welcome the aptly named Houston to tonight's program.
16: [Speaker B] Hey there, Derek. This is Houston from Texas. Not in Houston, Texas, but in Austin. So this was sometime between 2009, 2012. I really couldn't tell you the exact year at the time. A friend of mine, practically my brother, he had a Nissan 99, you know, the old pickup truck. So we're driving down the road, and we're kind of in the less economically advantaged part of town we're driving. And the Nissan, it had some issues, but it still ran. If you know anything about these trucks, they can actually take a lot of abuse. He had a pulley, the AC pulley actually, that, you know, controls the air conditioner belt. The belt was gone, but the pulley was still there. I believe we might have been on the way to the auto parts store to get the belt, but the pulley fell off because the nut was not holding it on very well. This was on a stretch of road that wasn't, at least that day, very heavily traveled. And so we saw the pulley. I mean, we heard it fall. I turned around from the passenger seat and saw it in the middle of the road. So we turned around and picked it up and pulled into a gas station. It's a clear day, middle of the day. Not cloud in the sky. It's not cold, not hot. Just a nice day. And so we popped the hood, put the pulley back on. While we're under the hood, putting it back on. I don't know what made me look. Nobody made a noise or anything. I just got this sense of, you know, look at the back of the truck, and I do so behind the bed of the truck, like directly at the back of it, whereas we were at the front. There's a man just a little bit older than us, not particularly old. It's kind of hard to guess his age, actually. Wrapped in a blanket, a brown woolen blanket. Just basic. I got the sense that he was naked under that blanket, but I don't know why, like he could have been wearing something. But I distinctly got the sense that he did not have a stitch of clothing on underneath that blanket. And he asked for some money. I happened to have cash on me and I reached into my pocket and I pulled out a five dollar bill because it's the lowest bill I had. And then my friend Michael, he puts his hand out and stops me and says, no, go inside the store. Because we were stopped at a gas station. He said, no, no, go inside the store and get him some food. I told him, no, man, he can decide what he wants to do with the $5. That's my opinion on that. And I go to hand him the five and he's gone. Me and Michael both saw him, both interacted with him, and then he's gone. The intersection that we're at has a clear line of sight in all directions. It's flat. He was barefoot. There is nowhere that he could have gone that quickly. Not only did we not see him approach, which by all logic, we should have, you know, when we went to open the hood, he was there so quickly, it's like he came out from under the car in the time it took me to turn to Michael and say no, that he just vanished. Anyway, love the show. Binging it while I drive around for work. So, yeah.
17: [Speaker A] Thank you, Houston. Well, that's something you don't hear about every day. A naked man under a blanket that simply disappeared. Now, I can't help but think that someone that's asking for money the way this man did, or that seems to have found himself in a situation like this man did. I doubt he's simply going to disappear before he's able to get the money that he asked for. After all, he was naked under a blanket in a place it sounds like he shouldn't have been. So it sounds like he could have used a couple of bucks. But we mustn't forget that humans are a strange breed. And individually, we're all apt to do all sorts of things the masses might deem unusual. Asking for money, then dipping before you can get it could fall under that category, I suppose. But regardless, it all made for a great story, Houston.

Just like in Vicki's story here out of the state of Minnesota.
18: [Speaker B] Hey Derek. This is Vicki from Minnesota. I have a short, kind of cute story. I was in the cities at my son's house. He wasn't home yet. I let myself in. He's got a new puppy, 11 weeks old and a 4 year old dog. And when I first got in the house, of course pup wants to get outside right away. So I did that and came back in. But I was hearing this strange sound. And when I went in his living room I realized he left the TV on for dogs, I guess. And there were sheep and they were making their sheep goises. So after about an hour of fooling around and I was tired of hearing this, so I found the remote, which he has like four or five of them that shut the TV off. So I shut it off and after a little bit, then the little pup looks down his hallway and kind of does his little puppy growl and just barks a little bit looking down his hallway. Well, it's a small house, so I look down the hallway. There's nothing I can see. His other dog did not react, but I thought it kind of weird. But the dogs, they horse around and all that stuff. And now I had shut the TV off, right? Well, I don't know. Hour or so later, TV pops on and it's Apple tv. It wasn't this other thing. And I thought, this is really strange. I grabbed the two remotes, tried to shut it off or change channel or whatever and nothing worked. And then I had to get out of the chair to go get one of them that actually shut the TV off. And I thought, well, how did this TV turn on in the first place? I wasn't touching the remotes, I wasn't sitting on the remotes. The two that were next to the chair didn't turn Apple TV on. So I don't know, I just thought that was kind of a weird thing to happen. Other weird things have happened in his house before, not necessarily recent. They were a long time ago. That's my story. Keep it spooky.
19: [Speaker A] Thank you, Vicky. Perhaps it was a ghost of some sort, a spirit that was enjoying the sheep just as much as the puppy was, and that spirit was so determined that it found a way to turn the unit back on. Or perhaps the puppy itself was controlling the TV with its mind, so determined to continue watching the sheep show that it simply willed the TV back to life. All joking aside, my TV does weird stuff all the time. It's not a ghost. It's just a buggy television. So maybe that's all it is, Vicki. A malfunctioning TV with a mind of its own. Thank you again, Vicki, for sharing the phone call. This episode is brought to you by Progressive Insurance. You chose to hit play on today's podcast. That was a smart choice.

21: [Speaker A] Now it's time for a wild UFO story. This time from Anonymous from parts unknown.
22: [Speaker B] Hi there. I wanted to call in and share with you a story that I've only shared a couple of times. This story takes place in somewhere around 1999 when I was later in high school. My husband now was my boyfriend at the time. And we lived in a community in Maryland where the neighborhood was kind of set away from the rest of the town that we lived in. And in our neighborhood there was an elementary school. So the school sat on the main road through our neighborhood, and along the backside of the school there was a small teachers parking lot and blacktop area and plain playground. So oftentimes, being kids that really didn't have anywhere to go, we would drive or walk over to the elementary school and sit on the playground and talk or walk around the grounds or whatnot. One evening we had probably gone to a movie or something earlier and weren't quite ready to go home. So we went parking at the elementary school. It was probably around 11 o', clock, and the way we were parked, the front of our car was facing the blacktop, and beyond the blacktop was the playground. So my husband and I were sitting in the car, talking and listening to music, when all of a sudden both of us looked out to face through the front window of the car. We see these lights that weren't there previously. My husband remembers there being three main lights, though I don't recall that detail. But I do remember that the lights were really bright, like led. But before led, it was really unusual because there had previously been only some motion detector floodlights on the outside of the building that were very old and yellowed. But this was really bright. It was also directly in front of us, not against the building where we had previously seen them a million times. So as we watched, it occurred to us that where there was previously blacktop, we were seeing what looked like a brick wall. Before, there was nothing that was unusual about the view from the parking lot when we had first pulled in. But now these lights seem to be affixed to what seemed like a brick surface or brick wall. It had kind of a cube shape. It was seated where the blacktop had been previously. And it spanned the entire width of the blacktop, probably 30ft. It almost looked like if you had pulled into the parking lot for the first time, you would have thought that the school extended into the blacktop instead of there being a blacktop at all. And you no longer were able to see the playground on the other side. It was solid. So this big brick looking box all of a sudden started to slowly lift up off the ground. And you could literally see the space between the blacktop and the bottom edge of it. And I remember specifically looking underneath to see if there was fire or lights or a Propeller or something that was lifting the building, ship, whatever it was, up. My boyfriend and I didn't even say anything to one another. We were just stunned and frankly terrified. And the building continued to lift up and over the school and disappeared somewhere where we could no longer see it above the car. You know, we hit the road, immediately, booked it out of there. As soon as we kind of like came to looking back, it seemed like the ship or whatever it was almost took the form of the building behind it, as if it had been hidden in plain sight. Sight. It's funny because as I hear from your other callers, people seem to sometimes forget about these things until they're reminded. And the same was true for us. It was bizarre and crazy and we couldn't believe it happened. But life goes on, particularly when you're a busy adolescent. Frankly, I think it maybe just fell out of my memory because it was in the category of we weren't supposed to go anywhere but straight home after the movie, so we couldn't tell our parents we had gone parking and nearly evaded UFO abduction. My husband and I didn't talk about it again after that night until nearly 20 years later. I had a memory flash of the event and I said to him, hey, do you remember that time we saw a UFO at the elementary school? When he shared his memory, it matched mine to a T. So that was really validating for me that I hadn't made this up or could have blown it up. We weren't using substances. It was just two kids, like hanging out. So there you have it. Thanks so much for the podcast and the community that you've created around these bizarre happenings.
23: [Speaker A] Thank you, caller. You know, we don't hear from the state of Maryland all that often, and typically when we do, I feel like it's a ghost story that the state is connected with, not typically a ufo. So I did a little digging around on this call, but without knowing the exact location, it was really difficult to pin anything down. I did, however, manage to find a handful of other reports out of the old line state that you just might be interested in, each describing a rectangle shaped object that, at least to me, sounds somewhat similar to what our caller described here. Now, I've linked to each of those National UFO Reporting center reports in the Show Notes at monsters among us podcast.com and under the Show Notes tab. But outside of those reports, I can confidently claim to you, caller, but I have no idea what it was you saw that evening. But I sure am glad that you told us all about It. And speaking of UFOs, I have one more flying saucer story to share with you tonight. This barn Burner by Mirko over in Italy.
24: [Speaker B] Hi Derek, this is Mirko. I'm reaching you from Italy, Bologna to be exact, in the northeast of the country. So this happened at the end of the 90s, maybe 98 or 99. I was about 11 or 12. I was in the Boy Scouts at the time. It was late summer, like the end of August and we were at summer camp. We traveled to the Gran Sasso area, a famous mountain in central east of Italy. This was one of the last nights of the two weeks period we spent there. The camp itself was situated in a big clearing of a wooded area at the foot of the mountain. It was about 10 or 10:30pm and all us kids and few adults were around the fire singing the night songs as usual. Suddenly a big shape appeared in the night sky. From the clearing I saw what seemed like a big geometric structure in flames. I mean it was completely covered and surrounded by fire. You know how really big things seem to almost fall in slow motion. That's exactly how it was. I remember all the kids looking at each other and then looking at the adults. Everyone was really scared. Now in all honesty, I cannot confirm or deny it was a UFO or a flying saucer or anything like that. All I know and all I, all I remember, it looked like a plane but without the wings and it was on fire and it was falling from the sky. This fireball thing crossed the sky we could see from the clearing and actually disappeared underneath the side of the mountain. After that. Some of the kids were actually freaking out, like real bad. I remember the strangest of the things that happened that night was the response from the adults. In some way they looked drunk or high in that moment. They tried to, you know, calm us down. And I was really feeling anxious and scared, like in danger. First of all, we are in the middle of the woods and this thing is on fire and everything could catch on fire. You know, a group of kids and like two or three adults. We don't want to be trapped in a massive fire. Second of all, this flying thing could contain creatures, could contain, you know, whatever. And yeah, they could get to us. And again, we are kid with two adults and we're not safe in here. Yeah, but the strangest thing was the adults, they were so calm, they were so relaxed. You know, they were smiling, they were trying to calm us down. They said it's probably fireworks. All I remember they looked so relaxed and so Calm. That was the scariest thing of all. They were real spooky. And after that, everyone seemed to fall under dispel. Yeah, everyone seemed to accept it was nothing. And they all came back again around the fire and they continue singing songs. And after this moment, I don't remember. I don't recall what happened. And this is another thing that in a way worries me most, is that after this moment, I don't remember anything until the next morning. And we never talked about what happened. Soon after that, I actually left the boy Scouts for cool reasons, time management and all of that. Yeah, 20 years has gone by and I don't think I will ever see anyone of them again. That's it, really. And I want to thank you for everything you do. Keep up the good work and have a good night. Bye.
25: [Speaker A] Grazie. Mirko. What an encounter. An encounter that leaves me with many, many questions, the biggest of which probably is why was it on fire? Was it landing to the earth? Was it crashing to the ground? And just what the hell was it? And where the hell did it come from? Well, Mirko, as it turns out, if it was a UFO and it did in fact crash that evening, it wouldn't be the first time. In the country of Italy in 1933.
26: [Speaker B] It'S claimed that a UFO crashed in the Lombardy region of Italy. This was apparently an object around 50ft in diameter, like two saucers joined together. It was described as being grayish in color and metallic. And apparently it was then taken by the military and studied on the personal orders of the then dictator Benito Mussolini. According to some accounts, the UFO crashed near the city of Magenta, just 80 miles northeast of Mount Municipal. The craft was found to be unoccupied and unlocking its secrets became a top priority.
27: [Speaker A] Now, that clip comes from the television series Ancient Aliens. And you know what I like to say about cases like this? If it's happened once, it can happen again. So whatever crash landed out there, Mirkow, I'm elated that we got to hear about it. Thank you again for taking the time to call in.

31: [Speaker A] You know, the bullpen should be better than what it is right now. You had some belief that this offense. Now, if you don't mind, I have more stories to share. This one from Elizabeth down there in Texas.
32: [Speaker B] Hello. I'm going to use my middle name, which is Elizabeth. I actually give readings and I don't want to spam on your show. I have a few stories, and this is before I even started giving readings. I'm not one of those psychics where I claim to see everything. I don't see dead people, but my dreams are that way. So this was around the year 2004. Me and my husband at the time were living in Houston, Texas. My dad's side of the family we're not very close to. Once my grandmother died, my dad's mother, the family just sort of stopped talking a lot on that side. You know, that goes sometimes when family members, they're not as close anymore. Once somebody dies in the family, like a grandparent, unfortunately. Anyhow, we were out there. We don't have any family out there at the time. He was going to college and I was just working. And I had a dream. In my dream, I was in my grandmother's house. She had died back in 1999, and this was around 2004. And in my dream, I was going through my grandmother's photo album in the dream, I felt like something wasn't right. Like someone passed on, but I didn't know if anyone did. So when I woke up, I told my mom about that dream about a week later. And I asked her, I said, by the way, did anyone on dad's side of the family die? Because I had this really weird dream. I just felt like sadness. And I was the only one in grandma's house. She said, no, I haven't heard anything. Again, my dad's side of the family, they don't talk very much. My parents live in the south, and most of my parents family, both of them, most of their family is in California because that's where originally from. So about a week went by and my mom says, so I found out that someone did die. One of your second cousins. We weren't really close to him. I think the last time I saw him was around 12 years old at one of my grandmother's birthday parties a long time ago, back in, like, 1993. And I'm 25 at the time when this is going on. And she said that she found out he had died in his sleep. And he wasn't very old. He was in his late 20s, actually. So about five days later, I have a dream where I see my cousin. He's walking in front of me in the dream, and he's wearing a black jersey with the number 3, 0. He looks behind and waves back to me. And he's walking with who looks like my Uncle Bill. We called him Uncle Bill, but he was basically my dad's uncle. But they called each other cousins because they're about the same age. So he was waving goodbye, and he was wearing just jeans and a black jersey with the number 3, 0. I remembered it in my dream. It was like crystal clear. We didn't go to the funeral. Unfortunately, neither did my mom or dad. And again, I didn't really talk to anyone really on that side of the family because, remember, we're not very close. So about a month later, I get in touch with someone on my dad's side of the family, and I tell her about my dream. I never went to the funeral. I didn't see any pictures or anything. This is, you know, before social media was big, right? So I didn't know anything. I told her about my dream and I said, you know, I think I saw Brad and my dream wave goodbye. And it was so crystal clear. I mean, he was wearing a black jersey and jeans with the number three on it. I don't know what that means. And she gasped he stopped and she was like, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, say that again. What was he wearing? And I said, he was wearing a black jersey with the number 30 on the back. And he was wearing like jeans. And she goes, oh, my God. I said, well, what's wrong? And she goes, he was buried in a black jersey and jeans. I said, what? And she goes, well, you know, his favorite team was the football team, the Oakland Raiders, you know, because we're all from California and I'm in Texas at the time, I'm in Houston with my husband and my daughter. I was like, oh my God. And she goes, not only that, the number of the jersey he was wearing was the number three. So in my dream it was three zero. I guess it was one of his favorite players was the number three. She's my witness to that because no one else had told me that. And I hadn't even been to the funeral and neither were my parents or my sisters or anyone. And I said, just curious, why did they dress him in a jersey and jeans? Because most of the time people dress him up really conservative and, you know, not that it's a big deal to me. And she goes, well, because his mother told his brother that he could dress him however he wanted and he wanted him to wear his black and silver Raiders jersey with the number three of his favorite teammate. So that was the most accurate dream I ever had. Anyway, I love your podcast, so I'll talk to you soon.
33: [Speaker A] Thank you, Elizabeth, for calling in. I can imagine having prolific dreams like that could be a bit frustrating, especially when they don't give you enough information to actually avert the oncoming tragedy. We've heard countless stories like this and I have countless more to share here in the future. And I've heard enough to know that there is something going on, some sort of connection to knowledge we don't quite understand yet. It just happens way too often for this to be some sort of coincidence. But I'm afraid determining anything outside of that is well beyond my pay grade. But we do appreciate you taking the time to share the call, Elizabeth. So thanks again for calling in. Alright, listeners, we're nearing the end, but we certainly aren't there yet. I still have several stories to share with you, beginning with Renee's out of Tennessee.
34: [Speaker B] Hi Derek and monsters among us family, this is Renee from Tennessee. I'm going to start with, like the most craziest paranormal experience that I had. So I live in Tennessee now. I'm 31 years old and I'm from Missouri, so I Remember the year, because something happened to me significantly, like the day after this happened. But I don't want to say what that was. But it had to have been like the year 2006. Going into 2007, I would have been like 12 or 13 years old. So this was the summertime. I've always been a night owl. And my family of one in five kids and my parents, we all grew up in like a small little three bedroom house in Missouri, 100 miles north of St. Louis. We were all out of school. This was in the middle of the summertime. Everybody was sleeping. I was a night owl of the family, always staying up. I still stay up. I work overnights right now. But anyway, I was watching a movie, laying on the couch. I think our little brother was on the couch with me. Whatever the night goes on. The movie I remember specifically too was Overboard with Goldie Hawn and whoever she's married to. But the movie goes on and I'm just, you know, I gotta pee. So I get up to go pee. And so with this house, like where we lived, I was small, basically when you walked into the front doors, the front room, and then there was a wall behind you and that's where the TV was at. And like across from the wall, the TV is the couch. Then next to the couch is like the doorway where you walk to go towards the back of the house. And from the front room was me and my sister's room. And then that opened up into the kitchen and then right through the kitchen was the bathroom right next to the stove. So each doorway, essentially you could look straight down the doorway and just see right from the front room door back to the bathroom door. I mean, it was a little staggered like the doorways, but I mean, essentially you could see straight through. There was nothing in my peripheral or nothing that could be there. But anyway, next to the bathroom doorway was the oven. And so I got up to go to the bathroom and there's a hat man. The hat man was sitting on the stove. I was terrified. He was sitting there and he was swinging his legs like, you know, like when your legs can't reach the floor, you're a kid, you know, you just swing your legs back and forth. Which is weird because I didn't hear his legs hitting that like, oven, you know, But I didn't see no facial features. Definitely wide brim hat. Look at his shadow guy. He was just dark and it was scary. Kind of getting shaky talking about this. So that was my experience with the hat man, shadow man. I didn't know anybody else had seen him until I started listening to your podcast and other paranormal podcasts and I was like, oh my gosh, other people have seen him. This is scary and crazy, but thank you and you all have a good day.
35: [Speaker A] Thank you, Renee. Spooky stuff. But you know what's worse than seeing a strange entity? Well, that's seeing three of them from the state of New Hampshire. Christina, the mic is yours.
36: [Speaker B] Hi Derek, this is Christina from New Hampshire calling. What I'm calling about tonight has to do with one of the earliest paranormal experiences that I can recall. This happened back when I was four and my family, we were living in Red Hook, New York at the time. The countryside, not the city where we lived, was on top of the massive hill. All of the trees on this hill were either apple trees, peach trees. I believe there were like three plum trees. It was an orchard. It was beautiful. Now this story comes from when I was in bed, top of my bunk. My sister was in the bottom bunk. I don't know what time it was, but even at this age, I had a terrible time with insomnia. I think I just staring at the ceiling, looking at the shadows in my room. I remember looking at my Minnie Mouse backpack, lightish pink with this like physical like mini head on the back. It was weird, but it was my favorite. I remember looking at this backpack and thinking the shadows looked a little weird. And something caught the corner of my eye and I looked to the left of it at my closet. Now my driveway, the front of our house, where my bedroom window was, there was a street light that would overlook our driveway. This would bring in some light. It was some nice night light for me growing up. But it would bring in the shadows of the bushes that like outlined my window, but it didn't cover my window. I want to be clear about this. When I looked over at my closet, I saw three figures, three beings, about three and a half to four feet tall, humanoid, odd shaped heads. But at the time I didn't really understand what I was looking for up. I just remember being puzzled. Why were there three beings in my room? The next thing I know, my father is literally kicking down my bedroom door. I remember him staring at me, wild eyed hair all a fluff. It is tighty whities. You don't forget that. He just looks at me with this wild expression and says, why are you screaming? I have no memory of screaming. I just remember looking at these beings and wondering what these shadows were that just looked so humanoid. When I looked back at the Closet after my father's, like, trying to figure out why he got woken up out of the middle of the night. There's nothing in front of my closet. My closet is not white from the reflected light coming in. So that just begs the question, did I have three beings manifest in my childhood bedroom and there was some kind of a time slip? And that's why I have no recollection as to why my father thought I was screaming, because I wasn't, or. And what my father did shortly after this makes me wonder, were there three beings standing outside of my window? The reason I say this is shortly after this incident, my father got some kind of a security system for our house. One that if I tried to open the window, which I found out the hard way, would let off a blaring alarm throughout the entirety of the house. So, yeah, I don't know. Thank you, Derek, for everything that you do, you guys. Love y'. All. Bye.
37: [Speaker A] Thank you, Christina, for calling in. Now, your guess here is as good as mine, but whatever it was, it sounded pretty terrifying. And listener, I bet when you heard me say three entities, you thought I was talking about a specific trio of time altering troublemakers. Perhaps. Well, I won't leave you wanting. Here with a story about those infamous mirrored men is Jacob out of the state of Texas.
38: [Speaker B] Hi, Derek, My name's Jacob from Marlin, Texas. I have a story about the mirror man. The time I saw it, I never even knew what I saw until I listened to your podcast. I was like freaked out about it, but this was like super late at night in South Padre. There's always a side of the beach where it's like really dark, where there's no light pollution. And when I saw these people, they were heading the dark side of the beach and for some reason I was the only one. They were same height, for some reason, they look white and bald. They're wearing like just green stuff and running exactly the same, just like pitch perfect, like mirror to mirror. I was weirded out because no one doesn't go to the dark side of the beach at all unless they're just fishing. But that's usually during the day. It not freaked me out. I was just kind of thrown back as what was these people? When people gave them description of three people exactly the same in height and everything, it was. Oh, that's what I saw. It was one of the weirdest thing I ever saw. But no, that was something I wanted to tell you. Huge fan though.
39: [Speaker A] Thank you, Jacob. What do you think, folks? Do we have a match now remember the checklist. Three people, typically men, walk in in unison with an identical appearance. The weather outside will be strange, a heat wave or a fog bank will roll in, and at a certain point they will all stop in unison and their heads will turn in unison and they'll look directly into your soul. That's when they'll steal time from you, sometimes up to eight full hours. Then they simply leave your life just as mysteriously as they first appeared. So what do you think, guys? Do we have a match now? A big thanks to Jacob and all of tonight's callers. I sure had a great time hanging out with Jens this evening. And the fun doesn't have to stop here, believe it or not.

43: [Speaker A] Now. You know I'd love to save the weirdest calls for this slot. The secret story and tonight's entry is par for the course. So from the big old state of Montana, please welcome Matt to tonight's episode.
44: [Speaker B] Hi Derek, My name is Matt. I live in Northwest Montana. I have had the same job for a number of years now and I drive the same road to work. Very early in the morning, about 2017 during the month of June, I saw what appeared to be a green ring fly across my field of vision. I don't know, it was a really strange experience. It was about the size of a dime, maybe a little bit smaller, held at arm's length, maybe about 30, 35 degrees in my field of vision went from left to right, which is approximately north to south. When it entered my field division, it was just A perfect green ring. By the time it left, it was asymmetrical and the leading edge had changed compared to the rest of it. I can't really describe what the difference was. It was just different. I know that they kind of ate me up for years. Sexual How I Found this Podcast Also, because of listening to your podcast, I found out about Paranormal Caught on Camera.
45: [Speaker A] Recently on season one, Episode eight, there.
46: [Speaker B] Was a couple in Italy that had filmed what I believe to be the exact same thing. And it was amazing to see. And it was such a great feeling of confirmation and validation. And it was the same color, it was the same circle. It didn't do quite the same thing at that point when they saw it, but I feel like that was exactly what I saw.
47: [Speaker A] Man, it just feels great to have that confirmation.
48: [Speaker B] Well, I really enjoy your podcast. Thanks a lot. Bye.
49: [Speaker A] Well, now that's interesting. Thank you, Matt, for calling in. Well, first off, he's right. What he's describing does sound exactly like a video that we discussed over on that television program, season one, Episode eight, if you're looking for it. And I linked the episode on Discovery. Plus if you happen to have that. If not, I've also linked to a couple of screenshots that show the ring in question, if you'd like to take a look. Certainly not something you typically see floating around up there, but what do you think, listeners? Anyone else have suggestions as to what this might be? I know that Powerline Transformers can produce a black ring when they malfunction and blow up. Is there a scenario where that ring of smoke can turn a green hue? I'm open to suggestions here, and so is Matt from the Sounds of Things. So let us know what you think. And thank you again, Matt, for making the Secret Story tonight super interesting. Now folks, it is time to go beyond the after show. We produce each and every Thursday directly after the main event. And I have a good one lined up for you here tonight. And it begins with this story from Corrine from my old home state of Ohio.
50: [Speaker B] Hi, this is Corinne. I'm from the west side of Cleveland. Homestead Falls is where I grew up. I've had a lot of experiences growing up with the supernatural. When I was a kid, I just thought it was normal to like have these feelings about things. I have a lot of experiences to share, but I think I'll start with the scariest. That was about in 2022 and my friend Stacey from college and I decided to go down to the Ohio Reformatory Prison in Mansfield. That was a year before so that was in like 20, 21 in October. When we were there, we listened to the guy who had been in the prison when he was a kid and his experiences there and it didn't really match up with like the museum that was there. You know, his stories were like, everyone has a shiv or you need to protect yourself. Where like the museum kind of showed. Oh, we found a few shivs, but it's not like people were dying there anyway. While I was there, we were there for like probably four hours. The museum part, I just felt like this sadness. And then we did like a self guided tour of the rest of the prison and somehow we ended up, when we were in the cell blocks, we ended up on a cell block that was off limits. Somehow we had ended up in there. As I was going past some of the cells, some of the cells were marked, you know, this famous person died or whatever. Those cells. I never felt anything but there was just like random cells. Dude, just like feel a cold spot as you walked past. As we were walking past these cells and I was feeling cold spots, one of the workers told us, hey, you're in the wrong spot so you can't be in this area. So then we like went to the correct area, wandered around some more. I ended up where the solitary confinement was and that was like.
