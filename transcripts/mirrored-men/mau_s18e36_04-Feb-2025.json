It's. Good evening and welcome to Monsters Among Us. I am your guide, Derek Hayes. Good evening, folks, and welcome back to the program. Now, I've been doing this for a long time. It'll be nine years and a little over a month. And in those nine years, I've noticed some patterns with some of these submissions. Certain places, certain types of people, certain situations tend to produce more unexplained events than others. And I couldn't tell you the cause, but I can point out the connection. And there is one place on this planet where more strange things seem to happen than any other. And it's a place that all of us venture to frequently. I'd say most of you encounter these liminal spaces on a daily basis. It's not hospitals. It's not prisons. It's not cemeteries, and it's not the deepest, darkest parts of the forest. I'm talking about the road, the veins and arteries of our society. The thoroughfares, the highways, the streets, lanes, alleys and dirt roads of the planet. And I don't know why these experiences are so frequent. Maybe it's because there are so many roads and so many people on them. So it's just a hasten. Or perhaps roads are the only way most of us reach these rural parts of the planet. Places that would otherwise go unseen by human eyes. Or maybe there's some magic in the idea that these thin strips of asphalt and concrete can transport us almost anywhere. Whatever the cause, the correlation is real. And I have the stories to prove it. And to put my money where my mouth is. Tonight's themed episode will be chock full of stories from the road. Tales of ghostly encounters, strange things witnessed overhead, and otherworldly creatures just off the berm. So to kick us off tonight, we begin with a classic from the state of Ohio. Please welcome Slice back to the program. Yo, what up, son? This is big Slice man from Hamilton, Ohio. So when I was about 17, which would have been about 21 years ago, me and friends, we like to just cruise around at all hours of the night. You know, you hear tales of stuff being haunting, crap like that. So we cruise out to places where that stuff goes on. So one night we're out just driving around aimlessly. It's probably about, I don't know, two, three in the morning and we're coming up to a four way stop in the middle of nowhere Ohio. It's like farmland type deal. But on like the left side of the road is like woods and on the right side of the road is a farm field. And on the stop sign on the right, I'm riding in the back of the truck, couple buddies and you know, I'm kind of looking forward and I see a guy leaned against the stop sign, one foot on the ground, one foot against like the post, and he's dressed in like black baggy clothes. Well, I think they're black. It was dark, so I don't really know what color they were. But like baggy, like tattered, tight clothes and looked like he had some kind of satchel on his back and a big old hat, you know, big full brim, like, like a half. They probably would have worn like a wild west, not like a cowboy hat, but a flat full brim, like big brim, trying to tuck down. But I could see he had a big defined nose and A long defined jaw. And it was so weird that anybody would be here at this time of night, just hanging out like we were on the interstate. I'd have figured he was a hitchhiker or something like that, but we weren't. We're in the middle of nowhere. So I'm thinking we're coming to this four way stop. And I'm thinking there's no way he's gonna stop with this because this guy stand there. Well, he starts to slow down and I'm like, oh, here we go. There's no telling with this guy. He's got to be whacked out on something to be standing out here like that, just chilling. So as we start to slow down, I'm no longer looking at him. It was sideways because at first I'm thinking, well, maybe if we don't make eye contact, he'll just stay over there. So we get closer, closer. We're slowing down and like an interfere just starts to get a hold of me. So weird. When we get to the stop sign, I look over, he's just gone. So I start like scanning the field, the other side of the road, anywhere he could have went, but he's just nowhere. It was like he just vanished into thin air. I can remember this to this day, like it just happened yesterday. And I asked my buddy driving later if he saw that fool. And he was like, what are you talking about? He had no clue what I was even speaking of. So I don't know what it was. But that's what my story is. Hick Slice Hamilton Church. Thank you, Slice. A disappearing stranger on a dark, remote back road. That's exactly the type of stuff that I'm talking about here. Now, to play devil's advocate, I grew up in Ohio and throughout the state we have many Amish communities. In fact, I worked with many Amish fellows back when I was in and just out of high school, and I'd give them a shout out here, but something tells me they're probably not listening. Anyway, my point here is that the description fits the bill. That sounds like an Amish style hat to me. Amish men typically wear these felt or straw wide brim hats, very similar to what Slice just described. The timing is also correct. Those guys are hard workers and their day typically begins super early, sometimes even 3 or 4am the time of Slices encounter. And lastly, they famously drive buggies pulled by horses, or usually just one horse. So if they're working away from home, either building a barn or helping to plant fields, they often have to hitch a ride. So what if this was just a young Amish guy waiting for his ride to work, and when he noticed the truck stop filled with rowdy young Englishmen, maybe he did the wise thing and ducked into the shadows when no one was looking. Because it's always better to avoid trouble than to figure out how to deal with it. So could Slice's strange encounter be that simple? Just a Amish gentleman waiting for work? Well, as you're about to learn this evening, many strange things are seen out there on the road, so it's entirely possible that my simple explanation has stalled in the passing lane. So, explainable or not, we appreciate the call as always, Slice. Thank you for calling in, folks. There are plenty more where that one came from, and I'm going to get right to them right after this quick message from tonight's sponsors. If you hit your ball through here.

We can't have a spooky episode all about the road and not play a story about a terrifying road trip. So here to help us out is Jamie from Nevada. Hi Derek, my name is Danny and I'm calling from Reno, Nevada. My wife and I recently found out that she was pregnant and that we were going to be having our first child together. Because of this great news, we decided to drive down to the LA area where both of us grew up and where most of our families still reside. It's a great time seeing everyone and sharing our news with them. But that's not what I'm calling about. That's just a little backstory. On our return trip to Reno, we encountered a lot of bad weather. This last winter in general had been insane. The most snowfall that we've seen in the Sierra Nevadas for at least a decade. Unfortunately, I know you know what that's been like this winter as well, Derek. Again, due to the intense winter and snowfall, many of the roads were either closed due to avalanche warnings or simply decaying due to the impact of the severe weather. In any case, it required to change up our normal route of taking 395North all the way from Mojave to Reno to now needing to go way east on the 6th and find our way up to Interstate 80 west. While going east over roads we were unfamiliar with, we were only getting more enveloped by weather issues. Heading east took us out of the snow potential, but it didn't take us out of extreme winds we experienced driving through a sandstorm for the first time, which honestly was more terrifying than driving through a whiteout blizzard. We couldn't see more than 15ft in front of our vehicle, causing us to drastically reduce our speed and contemplate pulling over until the storm had passed. But you couldn't see if anyone else was on the road, let alone pulled over. You truly couldn't see anything. We kept moving on through the storm until something caught our eye. To our right, just off the road, there was a strange break in the storm where we could see maybe 30ft just to the right of us. I don't know what caused us both to look over at that moment, but through the sandstorm just where the break occurred, a small creature came sprinting out of the storm towards the road. It saw us and immediately turned around and sprinted back into the storm. I don't think it expected to see us, and my wife and I were both yelling, did you see that? What was that? The Creature looked to be canine esque. We originally thought it may have been a coyote that had a really bad case of mange. But the more we thought about the size and the weird body shape the creature had, we began to go skeptical of reason and ventured more into the realm of the unknown. This creature was hairless, dog like, but seemed to have an elongated snout, almost a sunken back. Potentially it could have been a deformed coyote with mange, but the research we have done in the Chupacabra seemed almost too coincidental. No wings though. And again, we only got a quick glance at it, but we were both drawn to the area of the storm it came out before immediately running back into the abyss. I don't know if anyone else has ever driven on the 6th or had any other encounters in that area. Like I said, this was our first time on that road. I also don't know if it had anything to do with us literally listening to the Monsters Among Us podcast while our experience occurred and if that affected us mentally at all. But it was a polarizing occurrence to not be able to see anything, then have this break where a creature happened to run out towards us. Such a strange happening. Anyway, love the podcast. My wife showed it to me and I am hooked. Thanks Derek. Keep up the good work. Go Bucks. Thank you Jamie. And go Bucks. Now, I'll be honest, the story sounded awfully familiar to me and there's a good reason for that. Because I received a similar call just a few short months ago. A call from Jordan that aired on season 18 episode 25. Now, Jordan was helping with a biological survey in the Humboldt Toyabi National Forest. The Table Mountain Wilderness, specifically. Well, Jordan and his friend Mitch decided to take a short sunset hike when they encountered something unusual on the trail. Here's a brief segment of that call so you can hear for yourself just how similar these two stories are. All of a sudden, right in front of us, we saw something dart out from the bushes into the middle of the trail. We both, I remember this very clearly. We both looked at each other, looked back at where the thing was and we raised our flashlights to try and see it. And in the middle of the trail was a very large, black, almost kind of Great Dane sized dog creature. But like its legs were a little bit longer than its front legs, its hind legs were a little bit longer than its front legs. And as we're looking at it and just completely frozen, it was hairless, it had like black skin and like sickly, almost like a jaundiced yellow eyes and I remember a low growl and then it stood up on both its hind legs and. And ran off the trail and into the darkness. Well, as I'd mentioned, Jordan's encounter occurred in the Table Mountain Wilderness, a desolate swatch of land right in the middle of Nevada. There are no towns in this area and very few roads. But there is one road that passes nearby. I'm talking 30 or 40, maybe even 50 miles. But it's the closest road to that area. And it's a road that is known as the loneliest road in America. Or as you'll find it on the map, US 6. The exact same road Jamie had his experience on. Maybe it's just a big coincidence the two creatures described weren't exact matches. There seemed to be an obvious size difference here. But I will remind you that even the biggest monsters likely began as small ones. So regardless of what was witnessed either time, I have my eye on the situation. And if I find any more connections, I'll be sure to let you know. But in the meantime, thank you again to both Jamie and Jordan for those unsettling submissions. Now, folks, if you too would like to leave a story for me to share, maybe a story about an upright canine in the Silver State, give my hotline a call at 888-608-night. That's 888608, Nig H T. Or record your story as a voice memo and email it to me at monsters among us podcast.com we can't wait to hear from you. Now for another story about a mystery canine in the middle of the road, please welcome Kat from Alabama. Hi, this is Kat again. I'm driving right now. I know that's kind of against the rules and I really hope my signal stays viable. I'm in Alabama currently and it is foggy. Like Silent Hill foggy. I'm calling in because this just happened not even five minutes ago. I came up over a hill. The fog had gotten thicker and it's a two lane road. I'm on Alabama 5, heading north. I saw headlights in the fog and they flashed right at me like someone had flashed their high beams at me. And suddenly it just disappeared. Headlights and everything just disappeared. There was no way to. It just. Anyways, sorry. The reason why I'm so freaked out about this is because not half a mile down the road there's just this huge, gigantic. I've never seen a boxer this big, but I guess it was a stray. He was skinny looking. I'm sitting here thinking, I'm like, huh, that's weird because the stray, when I slowed down enough to pass him without hitting him, just sat there in the middle of the road like looking at me as I passed and I'm just like, well, holy crap, did a ghost car just warn me that there was a dog in the middle of the road? I don't know. I just wanted to share. Love the podcast. Going to go back to listen to it now. It was just. It's just really creepy. Thank you. Bye. Thank you, Cat. What do you guys think? Was a dog's life spared by a ghost car or was this all just a trick of the eye brought on by foggy conditions? Whichever it was, we can't thank you enough, Cat, for sharing it with us.

Please join me in welcoming Sean from here in California. Hi, my name is Sean and I'm in Southern California and I heard one of your shows about somebody in California years ago who saw a ghost or some apparition off the side of the road where no one should have been able to be. And then the description was a greaser type, I guess, is what he said. You know, from those old days, how guys dress. My grandpa used to dress like that back in the old days. When I heard that, I just, I. I don't know, I was a bit gobsmacked. I remembered something very similar that happened to me probably back in 2014 in Southern California, in the city of Whittier, there's like this place where people have all these urban legends about it's called Terrible Canyon. And I used to run there every day after work. I'd get in, you know, five, 10 miles of trail running, and it's really beautiful. And I used to love running there. It's got this kind of notoriety, but I loved it. I never experienced anything weird, any bad vibes. And I would be in the canyon, you know, running out at night after it gets dark. And I'd be by myself with the. Just like a headlamp or a flashlight or something. And I never even got the creeps, you know. It was just always a really beautiful place and really nice, despite all these urban legends and stuff like that, you know. And I'm not really one that I don't think I'm like super superstitious. But anyway, this is like the story. One night I was there. It was a summer night, probably around 2014, and I was running with a friend of mine. We got out of the canyon at night. It was probably eight or nine at night, and my friend was driving the car. We were parked at the corner, top of the hill, and we had to drive down the hill to get into the town and go home. And it's kind of a windy road and it's always been popular with like, you know, guys who are racing or motorcycles or cars, you know, ever since my grandparents days, you know, back in the 40s and stuff. And there's no sidewalk or anything like that. You know, the twisties are kind of like made in a way over this hill that on one side you've got a canyon, on the other side you've got a cliff. And we're driving down, getting towards home, and all of a sudden like we turn and the headlights catch this kid where no one should be. He was kind of like standing like off the embankment. There's a cliff there. And he wasn't wearing like running clothes or anything like that. I noticed his clothes right off the bat. Like he was dressed like a greaser kind of kid. He had the haircut and everything like that. I don't know, he kind of looked like a Morrissey fan or something, you know what I mean? And he was motioning for us to come over and we passed him and just a few moments later I told my friend like, hey, did you think that kid needed help? And my, my friend was like, what kid? You didn't see that kid? He's right in our headlights. And my friend was like, no, I didn't see anybody. Do you want to go back? And like right then it kind of hit me, like, why I usually stop right away or I see somebody needs help. I don't. You know, I just stopped right away. But this time I hesitated because there was something kind of off about this guy. He didn't look like he needed help. He was young, he must have been a teenager, maybe 18 or so. Mexican American looking guy, which is normal for the neighborhood. I mean, I'm from a Mexican American family myself. And when my friend said, let's turn around and go back or do you want to turn around and go back? And I said no, because, you know, for one thing it was a really dangerous spot. Like there's no way to walk there. And the thought crossed my mind, like, maybe this kid was like racing and his car went over the side or something like that. So I was like, well, I can't just do nothing. So I called the local fire department or something like that. Like, you know, I think I called, maybe I even called 911 and they transferred me and I tried my best to explain exactly at what point this was at on the road. So they like went out with like a helicopter and they really, they looked. I mean, they scoured and they kept calling me back and telling me like, are you sure it was here? And they didn't find anything. And like this. It had to have been within 10 minutes of me seeing this that I had made the call and they were mobile. It's serious business on this road. Like, you know, I'm sure people die there, you know, in car accidents. It's dangerous and people do like hot dogging stuff. There's. So that's why I made the call. See if there was an emergency, if the kid needed help. They didn't find anything. And, you know, I called the fire department the next day and verified it. The thought just crossed my mind, like they never found anything. And it always just kind of gave me the chills. Something about it just wasn't right. The guy shouldn't have been there. There was no way for him to be there. What did he want? You know, it's miles away from any pedestrian area. He looked like he was gesturing for us to come over, like to the drop on this hairpin turn over this cliff. It was just like he was like standing like right there on the embankment. So when I heard the story of somebody telling something pretty similar, I was like, whoa, that's kind of weird. And anyway, like everybody says, I don't tell this story to a lot of people. I don't want to add to the negative connotation this beautiful part of the town has. I don't really think it's spooky, but, you know, something kind of weird happened there. Like, I saw something weird. Definitely wasn't out of the corner of my eye. I saw it. I saw this kid. But anyway, that's my story. I hope that gives somebody the creeks out there. Thank you, Sean. Spooky stuff. And you're right, your story does sound familiar. Now luckily, I happen to know exactly what story you're referring to. Mickey T's tale from season 15 episode 17 and here is a brief portion of that phone call to jog your memory. At a certain point in the road, what my mom says she saw was two people standing on this hairpin curve. And at first as she started to come upon them, she thought they were just two people in need. And they were dressed oddly, though at first it just looked like regular people. So she thought they were needing help. They were waving their arms. Come here. And it was a male and a female. The male was dressed in 50s, 60s outfit, you know, kind of the greaser type with blue jeans and the cuffs were rolled, white T shirt. And the cuffs on the sleeves were rolled on his shirt and his hair was slicked back. And the girl was wearing what looked like a poodle skirt, a Dress of that kind from that period of the 50s and 60s. But what really freaked her out was when she got closer, she realized they had no feet. And she could see through their eyes, see the sky, the stars and moon behind them. And then she realized they were hovering out over the edge. They weren't actually on the shoulder. They were out over the cliff. So when she got closer and noticed that she had slowed down because she was thinking that they were a couple legitimately needing help. But then when she saw all that detail, she sped up and screaming and beating on my father, you know, to wake up that she just saw something horrifying. Pretty darn similar, if I do say so myself. And if you remember Mickey T's entry, there were other witnesses to this event. A truck driver and a carload of college students, all of which met up with and discussed the encounter with Mickey T. And his parents afterward. And I don't know that this is the exact same location, although it sounds like it could have been. Whittier and Pasadena are only about 20 miles apart, and there are plenty of mountains behind the city of Pasadena. Now, sadly, parts of those mountains were recently burned during the Eaton fire, I believe. But with a little luck, the greaser ghost remains. Now, before I move on here, Sean, if you happen to be listening, please reach back out to me and let me know the exact location where this entity was seen. Not only could that help me tie these two stories together, but it's likely close enough that I can make a drive down there myself to see if I can't explain experience the exact same thing. Thank you again to both of those scholars. That story gives me large Marge vibes for some reason, and I love it. Well, folks, this next story gives me island of Dr. Moreau vibes. Please join me in welcoming Marie to the program. Hi, this is Marie. I'm calling from. From California. I have a lot of different things that I could talk about, but I have a monster. One, I guess, or other dimensional. So I live in the high desert area of Southern California, and we're used to a lot of stray dogs ringing around all times of the night. There was a night, it was a Saturday night, and I was driving home from being about an hour east of where I live, and it was about two something in the morning. I was just a couple of blocks from my home on the main street, but where I live, it's rural, so Main street is still rural. Barely any lights, lots of dirt, plants, and, yeah, middle of nowhere type thing. And as I was driving down the street, about two and a half blocks from my home, I started to get this sensation to look to my right hand side at the road. On my left hand side there's houses, on the right hand side there's houses and then there's cross streets the whole way. So I got the sensation to look to my right side. And when I looked towards my right side at the corner that I was approaching, I saw what looked like an animal laying on the corner underneath the street light. But I felt weird because something just felt super, super off. I was like, okay, this is a large dog just laying there. Like, why is this feeling so weird? But as I was looking at what I was seeing and driving by it, because I started to slow down because it just felt weird, I noticed that the thing saw me looking at it and what was looking back at me from that creature had the head of an owl, or what I can best describe as an owl. So now I'm seeing what looks like a large dog with an owl head looking at me and I'm creeped out beyond belief, totally horrified and amazed at the same time. The head is moving in a very owl like manner. I got this sensation immediately that I'm not supposed to be seeing this. Like it's surprised to see me just as much as I'm surprised to see it. And I got completely scared that this thing was. All of a sudden I'm going up here in my back seat. I don't know why. So I decide to. I need to speed up. And I'm looking at this thing through my rearview mirror now. So I just couldn't keep my eyes off of it. And it was just staring what felt like it was staring like a hole in me. And I just couldn't believe what I was seeing. And I kept checking my back seat like a weirdo in the rearview mirror. Needless to say, it never came in the car with me. I made it home successfully, but to this day, I don't know what that was. It was like a dog owl or something. Like I said, it was like the body of a large dog, face of an owl, head, move like an owl. I don't know of anything that has been discovered by man that looks like that. So I'm calling because I want to see. Does anyone know of any mythical creatures that's in Southern California or the desert area that exists like that or anywhere or any culture? All right, thanks. Love your podcast. Bye. Thank you, Marie. That's an area I know all too well, and it's certainly a land full of magic So I guess I'm not all that surprised that you saw something weird while driving around out there under the stars. What that something is, however, I haven't the foggiest. But I did ask Delaney to do some digging on the subject and she sorta came up empty. Though she did point out one interesting common thread. It is worth noting that both these animals, dogs and owls, are considered to be psychopomps, guides whose primary function is to escort souls to the afterlife. Cultures from across the globe have associated each of these animals with death, dying, bad omens, witches, ill intent in the underworld or afterlife. So take that however you'd like, Marie, and thank you for sharing. I'll be sure to keep my eyes open the next time I'm down there. No open houses and no inconveniences.

Hi Derek. My name is Brandy. I'm from southeast Texas and I have listened for a long time and this is my first call in. So I'm calling in with an alien black cat story just for you. I moved into a new house and I moved in in August and this happened around November. I work night, so I leave work at about 6am I get home at about 6:36, 35. So this would have been about 6, 26, 25 in the morning, still dark like I said November. So longer nights still full on dark, more or less at 6 in the morning. So I was driving home and I take a back road that kind of circles around my hometown. And it's kind of tightly packed with people up until a certain point. And then the yards get bigger, the spaces open up, but it stays a little narrow two lane road. Now this road circles back around my town past like a big drainage ditch that runs from the middle of town out into the fields and between the neighborhoods on one side and a big cemetery on the other. Now there's a little bridge that goes over, like I said, this giant drainage ditch. And coming around the corner on my way to the drainage ditch. So there's still houses on my left hand side and there's the cemetery on my right hand side almost to this bridge. And this really big for a cat, black cat, about the size of a good sized German shepherd. But it didn't move like a dog. It moved like a cat jumps from down in the grass on the left hand side of my car straight through my headlights. So it's not like I couldn't see what I was looking at straight through my headlights. Dark, dark black, little light cubby ears. I know that sounds stupid, but like little cat ears but rounded like panthers kind of like that. I cannot for the life of me remember if it had a tail or not. But it cleared this two lane road in one jump like it had front paws on the street on the left hand side, back paws in the grass and jumped and made it to front paws in the grass and back paws on the paved part of the road on the other side. And then it was gone. I mean it's weird because it was still in the middle of town, but on that side of town where the yards start to open up and the houses aren't quite as tight together. We do see a lot of deer. So I mean it wouldn't be weird that something that you know could eat deer would be out there. But it was the only time I've seen it. I haven't seen anything since I didn't hear anything around the time about, you know, like, pets or anything going missing. Nobody else that I've talked to in town has ever seen anything like it. So I don't know, maybe I'm just crazy. But I just wanted to call in and tell you about it. Thanks so much for the podcast. It's a great platform for us weirdos to call in and let other people know about the weird stuff that we see. Good luck. I hope you and Sarah are doing okay and that's all. Okay, bye. Thank you, Brandy. Sarah and I can't complain. We're taking it one day at a time just like everyone else. But with fun calls like this one, some days are brighter than others. It's funny that Brandy would mention that the big cat was seen in town and that she thought maybe that took away a bit from the credibility. Well, I come from a very small town myself. So small that they don't even call it a town. They refer to it as a village. But my brother, my brother was police chief there for several years and my mom lives right there in town to this day. And both my brother and my mother have claimed to see something similar. A large, black, big cat within village limits. In fact, I'm pretty sure both stories were featured on the very first episode of this program back when I had to hunt down stories. Thankfully, they now come to me. And thankfully, they're almost always amazing tales, just like Brandy's. So thank you again for taking the time to share.

Now this next entry takes us north to Illinois. Mac, welcome to the program. Hey, Derek. Wow, longtime listener. Love the podcast and I've been planning on calling in for a while. This is. I'm gonna go say Mac from Northern Illinois. Been planning on calling in about a few things, but didn't expect this to be how my first call would be because I just had something happen to me on the road tonight. So not an over road driver, but I definitely put in probably about anywhere between 600 and 800 miles a week. On the road, driving a week and up in northern Illinois tonight, in November here, it's our first snow. But I was driving a stretch of road I'm very used to right near my hometown. And the craziest thing is I'm coming around this one corner that we normally have, and I'm used to there being all types of lights from all types of vehicles. We get a lot of farm equipment out there and stuff. And this was not a light I've never come around the corner to. And for just a half a second, it was way more encompassing of everything being bright than I'm used to. And then, I swear, in my view, just as I'm driving up, it looked like this light almost transformed. It's really hard to explain, but it's like the light almost folded in on itself. And then it came out to look like a light. More like the front lights of kind of like a truck with maybe some extra LED tops on it or something, when you're thinking some of the just guys with the raised trucks to look something more normal. But it went from a form and a shade of light as I was turning this corner that I said, and I have goosebumps just around this because I just drove up the road and pulled over because this is weird, but oh, my gosh, I swear that light just transformed right in front of me to make it look more like a car. And I don't know if this is some trickster thing, I don't know. But just ever since I started driving around that corner almost before the lights, I swear I've just had my goosebumps up and my skin crawling, feeling like something is in the air, like an electricity. And this was weird. I don't know what the classified other than weird lights on the road, but I don't know what to say. I did not expect to see this on the road tonight. Be safe out there. Keep doing what you're doing, because we need places where we can talk about this weird stuff. Man, this is crazy on the streets. Have a good day. Thank you, Mac. No, I don't know this as a fact, but it sounds right to me. I bet a majority of UFO sightings are made by people in vehicles, especially drivers, because think about it. They're surrounded by windows, they're bored out of their gourd, and their eyes are glued to the landscape in front of them, or at least they should be. So you would think that that combination would make them more susceptible to sightings. So I suppose none of this surprises me, Mac. But regardless, thank you again for sharing your experience.

This weekend, launching a website, sharing his amended complaint in his. Now then, next up is another mystery man in the middle of the road, this time out of the state of Texas. Please join me in welcoming this anonymous caller to the platform. Hello, I'm calling from San Marcos, Texas. I wanted to share an eerie experience I had this past October 2024. I walk regularly each day for exercise. However, I had some medical skin treatments and was to stay out of the sun for three weeks. So I decided to walk a half hour before dawn. For that time I started out by walking down a semi steep street. Street terminates at a T intersection which has a lone street light. There appeared to be an unusual person in the middle of the street walking down towards the T intersection. It was not quite 2/3 of the way down the street here what seemed to have a wide stance and the legs were much longer than normal. Very much disproportionate to the body. He was tall. It had a jerking shaking movement. I was gaining on him and I was wondering if he was using stilts or something. Got a little closer, maybe about 60ft from him. I could see white legs at the end of the pant legs and socks and shoes. His pant legs looked a little too short for the leg. Maybe about a foot short. I say. An animal starts scattering in all directions from him. Cat started to the right, deer to the left. Other animals were too blurry to identify. I started to feel the hair raised on the back of my neck and goosebumps on my arms. Strange person made it to the T intersection before me. His back was too me and appeared to be standing still looking at the house on the left. As I approached it sensed that I was there. It said sort of the turn about 10 degrees only and then the whole body started turning in a staggering shuffling motion. My eyes were locked on the back of his head. I was terrified and my gut instinct seemed to warn me not to look at his face. I turned right quickly at the T intersection. That street goes up a steep incline. I was up to the top quicker than ever before. I stopped doing the pre dawn walks and still have uneasy memory of the event. I'm 70 and never experienced anything like this. Now I often wonder what if I had looked at his face. Thank you caller. You know, years ago I shared a story about a woman jogging with her dog that encountered a 10 old year 10 foot tall praying mantis or grasshopper like creature just standing there under a streetlight. I believe that was season three episode one if you want to try to check it out. But anyway, the story somehow reminds me a bit of that entry. Different creatures but a similar scenario and the same spooky results. But you know, there is one thing out there that's worse than a jerky lanky man that frightens animals and that is three of them. Here with the latest installment of the Mirrored Men saga is Dustin out of the state of Oregon. Hey Derek, this is Dustin from central Oregon. I thought about calling for a long time because I saw something when I was probably 10 or 12 hunting with my dad in the Ochikos. And I wasn't sure if it pertained to the Mirrored Men. But the more I listen to stories the more I'm kind of thinking about it and it kind of scares me a lot. When I was little, the first time I went hunting with my dad, we went out into the Ochakos and we went with my grandfather, my mom's dad and he had a trailer. And in the back of the trailer, there was a bunk bed, and I slept on the top bunk. And there were two sides to the trailer, and both sides had, like, a little porthole window so you can, like, look out. Well, two or three days in, I can't really remember to the trip, it started snowing really bad, like, blizzard style. And we were in the mountains, and we didn't really have anything. And so my dad was kind of just waiting to figure out whether or not we would need to go back into town and cancel our trip or if we could continue hunting. And that night, I was just. I don't know if I was asleep at that point or if I had woken up or if I had still been up, but I was, like, up. And I looked over towards. Because the. The campground was only maybe, like, a couple hundred yards away from, like, the gravel mountain road that, like, led out into the woods. And then there were, like, campgrounds on either side of the road. So we were only a couple hundred yards away from the road. And it was pouring snow outside. Not, like, heavy, like, where it was, like, heavy wind. It was just like, there were huge snowflakes falling, like, consistently, probably about a foot of snow outside. And I saw three identical figures walking down the road. And they looked like they had, like, towels, like, big black towels on their shoulders. They all looked exactly the same. Nobody had, like, anything in their hands like in previous stories. They were just walking together down the road. And I felt very, very, very, very strongly that they could see me and that they knew that I was looking at them. None of them looked at me. And like, so many of the stories say, like, one or all of them will, like, turn their heads to look. I felt very strongly that they were going to do that at any moment, but they never did and just walked back, like, by the camp and then down the road. And I always thought, you know, they're probably, like, more hunters, like, going to the camp. Like, they had been hiking all day, and then they were just going back. And then they had black, like, shaws on because of the snow. Like, and then, of course, they would all have, like, sort of the same thing. But the more that I hear these stories about the mirrored men, the more it terrifies me. And for some reason, that's always terrified me, that experience. And the more I hear about the mirrored men, the more it terrifies me, and it keeps making me remember that story. So, yeah, I'm in central Oregon. We were hunting in the Ochaco Mountain range, and that's it. Thank you so much. Thank you for calling in, Dustin. While there are a few parameters to a sighting that I think constitutes it as a true mere d experience, whatever the hell that is. And those details are as three men dressed the same and walking in unison? Check. The feeling of dread or that you're being watched? Check. Bad, strange or inclement weather? Also check. Which means the only characteristic I think is missing in this account is the absence of missing time, one of the key elements of a Mirrored man encounter. Now, that doesn't mean what he witnessed that evening was not the mirrored man, but it is something worth noting. And whatever it was he saw, it certainly sounds downright terrifying. So thank you. Thank you again, Dustin, for taking the time to ring in. And thank you, dear listener, for spending part of your evening here with us. It's been a real treat to share the airwaves with you now.

It'll be nine years and a little over a month. And in those nine years, I've noticed some patterns with some of these submissions. Certain places, certain types of people, certain situations tend to produce more unexplained events than others. And I couldn't tell you the cause, but I can point out the connection. And there is one place on this planet where more strange things seem to happen than any other. And it's a place that all of us venture to frequently. I'd say most of you encounter these liminal spaces on a daily basis. It's not hospitals. It's not prisons. It's not cemeteries, and it's not the deepest, darkest parts of the forest. I'm talking about the road, the veins and arteries of our society. The thoroughfares, the highways, the streets, lanes, alleys and dirt roads of the planet. And I don't know why these experiences are so frequent. Maybe it's because there are so many roads and so many people on them. So it's just a hasten. Or perhaps roads are the only way most of us reach these rural parts of the planet. Places that would otherwise go unseen by human eyes. Or maybe there's some magic in the idea that these thin strips of asphalt and concrete can transport us almost anywhere. Whatever the cause, the correlation is real. And I have the stories to prove it. And to put my money where my mouth is. Tonight's themed episode will be chock full of stories from the road. Tales of ghostly encounters, strange things witnessed overhead, and otherworldly creatures just off the berm. So to kick us off tonight, we begin with a classic from the state of Ohio. Please welcome Slice back to the program.",

      "text": "Yo, what up, son? This is big Slice man from Hamilton, Ohio. So when I was about 17, which would have been about 21 years ago, me and friends, we like to just cruise around at all hours of the night. You know, you hear tales of stuff being haunting, crap like that. So we cruise out to places where that stuff goes on. So one night we're out just driving around aimlessly. It's probably about, I don't know, two, three in the morning and we're coming up to a four way stop in the middle of nowhere Ohio. It's like farmland type deal. But on like the left side of the road is like woods and on the right side of the road is a farm field. And on the stop sign on the right, I'm riding in the back of the truck, couple buddies and you know, I'm kind of looking forward and I see a guy leaned against the stop sign, one foot on the ground, one foot against like the post, and he's dressed in like black baggy clothes. Well, I think they're black. It was dark, so I don't really know what color they were. But like baggy, like tattered, tight clothes and looked like he had some kind of satchel on his back and a big old hat, you know, big full brim, like, like a half. They probably would have worn like a wild west, not like a cowboy hat, but a flat full brim, like big brim, trying to tuck down. But I could see he had a big defined nose and A long defined jaw. And it was so weird that anybody would be here at this time of night, just hanging out like we were on the interstate. I'd have figured he was a hitchhiker or something like that, but we weren't. We're in the middle of nowhere. So I'm thinking we're coming to this four way stop. And I'm thinking there's no way he's gonna stop with this because this guy stand there. Well, he starts to slow down and I'm like, oh, here we go. There's no telling with this guy. He's got to be whacked out on something to be standing out here like that, just chilling. So as we start to slow down, I'm no longer looking at him. It was sideways because at first I'm thinking, well, maybe if we don't make eye contact, he'll just stay over there. So we get closer, closer. We're slowing down and like an interfere just starts to get a hold of me. So weird. When we get to the stop sign, I look over, he's just gone. So I start like scanning the field, the other side of the road, anywhere he could have went, but he's just nowhere. It was like he just vanished into thin air. I can remember this to this day, like it just happened yesterday. And I asked my buddy driving later if he saw that fool. And he was like, what are you talking about? He had no clue what I was even speaking of. So I don't know what it was. But that's what my story is. Hick Slice Hamilton Church.",

      "text": "Thank you, Slice. A disappearing stranger on a dark, remote back road. That's exactly the type of stuff that I'm talking about here. Now, to play devil's advocate, I grew up in Ohio and throughout the state we have many Amish communities. In fact, I worked with many Amish fellows back when I was in and just out of high school, and I'd give them a shout out here, but something tells me they're probably not listening. Anyway, my point here is that the description fits the bill. That sounds like an Amish style hat to me. Amish men typically wear these felt or straw wide brim hats, very similar to what Slice just described. The timing is also correct. Those guys are hard workers and their day typically begins super early, sometimes even 3 or 4am the time of Slices encounter. And lastly, they famously drive buggies pulled by horses, or usually just one horse. So if they're working away from home, either building a barn or helping to plant fields, they often have to hitch a ride. So what if this was just a young Amish guy waiting for his ride to work, and when he noticed the truck stop filled with rowdy young Englishmen, maybe he did the wise thing and ducked into the shadows when no one was looking. Because it's always better to avoid trouble than to figure out how to deal with it. So could Slice's strange encounter be that simple? Just a Amish gentleman waiting for work? Well, as you're about to learn this evening, many strange things are seen out there on the road, so it's entirely possible that my simple explanation has stalled in the passing lane. So, explainable or not, we appreciate the call as always, Slice. Thank you for calling in, folks. There are plenty more where that one came from, and I'm going to get right to them right after this quick message from tonight's sponsors.",

      "text": "Hi Derek, my name is Danny and I'm calling from Reno, Nevada. My wife and I recently found out that she was pregnant and that we were going to be having our first child together. Because of this great news, we decided to drive down to the LA area where both of us grew up and where most of our families still reside. It's a great time seeing everyone and sharing our news with them. But that's not what I'm calling about. That's just a little backstory. On our return trip to Reno, we encountered a lot of bad weather. This last winter in general had been insane. The most snowfall that we've seen in the Sierra Nevadas for at least a decade. Unfortunately, I know you know what that's been like this winter as well, Derek. Again, due to the intense winter and snowfall, many of the roads were either closed due to avalanche warnings or simply decaying due to the impact of the severe weather. In any case, it required to change up our normal route of taking 395North all the way from Mojave to Reno to now needing to go way east on the 6th and find our way up to Interstate 80 west. While going east over roads we were unfamiliar with, we were only getting more enveloped by weather issues. Heading east took us out of the snow potential, but it didn't take us out of extreme winds we experienced driving through a sandstorm for the first time, which honestly was more terrifying than driving through a whiteout blizzard. We couldn't see more than 15ft in front of our vehicle, causing us to drastically reduce our speed and contemplate pulling over until the storm had passed. But you couldn't see if anyone else was on the road, let alone pulled over. You truly couldn't see anything. We kept moving on through the storm until something caught our eye. To our right, just off the road, there was a strange break in the storm where we could see maybe 30ft just to the right of us. I don't know what caused us both to look over at that moment, but through the sandstorm just where the break occurred, a small creature came sprinting out of the storm towards the road. It saw us and immediately turned around and sprinted back into the storm. I don't think it expected to see us, and my wife and I were both yelling, did you see that? What was that? The Creature looked to be canine esque. We originally thought it may have been a coyote that had a really bad case of mange. But the more we thought about the size and the weird body shape the creature had, we began to go skeptical of reason and ventured more into the realm of the unknown. This creature was hairless, dog like, but seemed to have an elongated snout, almost a sunken back. Potentially it could have been a deformed coyote with mange, but the research we have done in the Chupacabra seemed almost too coincidental. No wings though. And again, we only got a quick glance at it, but we were both drawn to the area of the storm it came out before immediately running back into the abyss. I don't know if anyone else has ever driven on the 6th or had any other encounters in that area. Like I said, this was our first time on that road. I also don't know if it had anything to do with us literally listening to the Monsters Among Us podcast while our experience occurred and if that affected us mentally at all. But it was a polarizing occurrence to not be able to see anything, then have this break where a creature happened to run out towards us. Such a strange happening. Anyway, love the podcast. My wife showed it to me and I am hooked. Thanks Derek. Keep up the good work. Go Bucks.",

Now, Jordan was helping with a biological survey in the Humboldt Toyabi National Forest. The Table Mountain Wilderness, specifically.

And in the middle of the trail was a very large, black, almost kind of Great Dane sized dog creature. But like its legs were a little bit longer than its front legs, its hind legs were a little bit longer than its front legs. And as we're looking at it and just completely frozen, it was hairless, it had like black skin and like sickly, almost like a jaundiced yellow eyes and I remember a low growl and then it stood up on both its hind legs and.

There are no towns in this area and very few roads. But there is one road that passes nearby. I'm talking 30 or 40, maybe even 50 miles. But it's the closest road to that area. And it's a road that is known as the loneliest road in America. Or as you'll find it on the map, US 6. The exact same road Jamie had his experience on. Maybe it's just a big coincidence the two creatures described weren't exact matches. There seemed to be an obvious size difference here. But I will remind you that even the biggest monsters likely began as small ones. So regardless of what was witnessed either time, I have my eye on the situation. And if I find any more connections, I'll be sure to let you know. But in the meantime, thank you again to both Jamie and Jordan for those unsettling submissions.

I'm on Alabama 5, heading north. I saw headlights in the fog and they flashed right at me like someone had flashed their high beams at me. And suddenly it just disappeared. Headlights and everything just disappeared. There was no way to. It just. Anyways, sorry. The reason why I'm so freaked out about this is because not half a mile down the road there's just this huge, gigantic. I've never seen a boxer this big, but I guess it was a stray. He was skinny looking. I'm sitting here thinking, I'm like, huh, that's weird because the stray, when I slowed down enough to pass him without hitting him, just sat there in the middle of the road like looking at me as I passed and I'm just like, well, holy crap, did a ghost car just warn me that there was a dog in the middle of the road?

      "text": "Hi, my name is Sean and I'm in Southern California and I heard one of your shows about somebody in California years ago who saw a ghost or some apparition off the side of the road where no one should have been able to be. And then the description was a greaser type, I guess, is what he said. You know, from those old days, how guys dress. My grandpa used to dress like that back in the old days. When I heard that, I just, I. I don't know, I was a bit gobsmacked. I remembered something very similar that happened to me probably back in 2014 in Southern California, in the city of Whittier, there's like this place where people have all these urban legends about it's called Terrible Canyon. And I used to run there every day after work. I'd get in, you know, five, 10 miles of trail running, and it's really beautiful. And I used to love running there. It's got this kind of notoriety, but I loved it. I never experienced anything weird, any bad vibes. And I would be in the canyon, you know, running out at night after it gets dark. And I'd be by myself with the. Just like a headlamp or a flashlight or something. And I never even got the creeps, you know. It was just always a really beautiful place and really nice, despite all these urban legends and stuff like that, you know. And I'm not really one that I don't think I'm like super superstitious. But anyway, this is like the story. One night I was there. It was a summer night, probably around 2014, and I was running with a friend of mine. We got out of the canyon at night. It was probably eight or nine at night, and my friend was driving the car. We were parked at the corner, top of the hill, and we had to drive down the hill to get into the town and go home. And it's kind of a windy road and it's always been popular with like, you know, guys who are racing or motorcycles or cars, you know, ever since my grandparents days, you know, back in the 40s and stuff. And there's no sidewalk or anything like that. You know, the twisties are kind of like made in a way over this hill that on one side you've got a canyon, on the other side you've got a cliff. And we're driving down, getting towards home, and all of a sudden like we turn and the headlights catch this kid where no one should be. He was kind of like standing like off the embankment. There's a cliff there. And he wasn't wearing like running clothes or anything like that. I noticed his clothes right off the bat. Like he was dressed like a greaser kind of kid. He had the haircut and everything like that. I don't know, he kind of looked like a Morrissey fan or something, you know what I mean? And he was motioning for us to come over and we passed him and just a few moments later I told my friend like, hey, did you think that kid needed help? And my, my friend was like, what kid? You didn't see that kid? He's right in our headlights. And my friend was like, no, I didn't see anybody. Do you want to go back? And like right then it kind of hit me, like, why I usually stop right away or I see somebody needs help. I don't. You know, I just stopped right away. But this time I hesitated because there was something kind of off about this guy. He didn't look like he needed help. He was young, he must have been a teenager, maybe 18 or so. Mexican American looking guy, which is normal for the neighborhood. I mean, I'm from a Mexican American family myself. And when my friend said, let's turn around and go back or do you want to turn around and go back? And I said no, because, you know, for one thing it was a really dangerous spot. Like there's no way to walk there. And the thought crossed my mind, like, maybe this kid was like racing and his car went over the side or something like that. So I was like, well, I can't just do nothing. So I called the local fire department or something like that. Like, you know, I think I called, maybe I even called 911 and they transferred me and I tried my best to explain exactly at what point this was at on the road. So they like went out with like a helicopter and they really, they looked. I mean, they scoured and they kept calling me back and telling me like, are you sure it was here? And they didn't find anything. And like this. It had to have been within 10 minutes of me seeing this that I had made the call and they were mobile. It's serious business on this road. Like, you know, I'm sure people die there, you know, in car accidents. It's dangerous and people do like hot dogging stuff. There's. So that's why I made the call. See if there was an emergency, if the kid needed help. They didn't find anything. And, you know, I called the fire department the next day and verified it. The thought just crossed my mind, like they never found anything. And it always just kind of gave me the chills. Something about it just wasn't right. The guy shouldn't have been there. There was no way for him to be there. What did he want? You know, it's miles away from any pedestrian area. He looked like he was gesturing for us to come over, like to the drop on this hairpin turn over this cliff. It was just like he was like standing like right there on the embankment. So when I heard the story of somebody telling something pretty similar, I was like, whoa, that's kind of weird. And anyway, like everybody says, I don't tell this story to a lot of people. I don't want to add to the negative connotation this beautiful part of the town has. I don't really think it's spooky, but, you know, something kind of weird happened there. Like, I saw something weird. Definitely wasn't out of the corner of my eye. I saw it. I saw this kid. But anyway, that's my story. I hope that gives somebody the creeks out there.",

So she thought they were needing help. They were waving their arms. Come here. And it was a male and a female. The male was dressed in 50s, 60s outfit, you know, kind of the greaser type with blue jeans and the cuffs were rolled, white T shirt. And the cuffs on the sleeves were rolled on his shirt and his hair was slicked back. And the girl was wearing what looked like a poodle skirt, a Dress of that kind from that period of the 50s and 60s. But what really freaked her out was when she got closer, she realized they had no feet. And she could see through their eyes, see the sky, the stars and moon behind them. And then she realized they were hovering out over the edge. They weren't actually on the shoulder. They were out over the cliff.

Now, sadly, parts of those mountains were recently burned during the Eaton fire, I believe. But with a little luck, the greaser ghost remains. Now, before I move on here, Sean, if you happen to be listening, please reach back out to me and let me know the exact location where this entity was seen. Not only could that help me tie these two stories together, but it's likely close enough that I can make a drive down there myself to see if I can't explain experience the exact same thing. Thank you again to both of those scholars. That story gives me large Marge vibes for some reason, and I love it. Well, folks, this next story gives me island of Dr. Moreau vibes. Please join me in welcoming Marie to the program.",

      "text": "Hi, this is Marie. I'm calling from. From California. I have a lot of different things that I could talk about, but I have a monster. One, I guess, or other dimensional. So I live in the high desert area of Southern California, and we're used to a lot of stray dogs ringing around all times of the night. There was a night, it was a Saturday night, and I was driving home from being about an hour east of where I live, and it was about two something in the morning. I was just a couple of blocks from my home on the main street, but where I live, it's rural, so Main street is still rural. Barely any lights, lots of dirt, plants, and, yeah, middle of nowhere type thing. And as I was driving down the street, about two and a half blocks from my home, I started to get this sensation to look to my right hand side at the road. On my left hand side there's houses, on the right hand side there's houses and then there's cross streets the whole way. So I got the sensation to look to my right side. And when I looked towards my right side at the corner that I was approaching, I saw what looked like an animal laying on the corner underneath the street light. But I felt weird because something just felt super, super off. I was like, okay, this is a large dog just laying there. Like, why is this feeling so weird? But as I was looking at what I was seeing and driving by it, because I started to slow down because it just felt weird, I noticed that the thing saw me looking at it and what was looking back at me from that creature had the head of an owl, or what I can best describe as an owl. So now I'm seeing what looks like a large dog with an owl head looking at me and I'm creeped out beyond belief, totally horrified and amazed at the same time. The head is moving in a very owl like manner. I got this sensation immediately that I'm not supposed to be seeing this. Like it's surprised to see me just as much as I'm surprised to see it. And I got completely scared that this thing was. All of a sudden I'm going up here in my back seat. I don't know why. So I decide to. I need to speed up. And I'm looking at this thing through my rearview mirror now. So I just couldn't keep my eyes off of it. And it was just staring what felt like it was staring like a hole in me. And I just couldn't believe what I was seeing. And I kept checking my back seat like a weirdo in the rearview mirror. Needless to say, it never came in the car with me. I made it home successfully, but to this day, I don't know what that was. It was like a dog owl or something. Like I said, it was like the body of a large dog, face of an owl, head, move like an owl. I don't know of anything that has been discovered by man that looks like that. So I'm calling because I want to see. Does anyone know of any mythical creatures that's in Southern California or the desert area that exists like that or anywhere or any culture? All right, thanks. Love your podcast. Bye.",

That's an area I know all too well, and it's certainly a land full of magic So I guess I'm not all that surprised that you saw something weird while driving around out there under the stars. What that something is, however, I haven't the foggiest. But I did ask Delaney to do some digging on the subject and she sorta came up empty. Though she did point out one interesting common thread. It is worth noting that both these animals, dogs and owls, are considered to be psychopomps, guides whose primary function is to escort souls to the afterlife. Cultures from across the globe have associated each of these animals with death, dying, bad omens, witches, ill intent in the underworld or afterlife. So take that however you'd like, Marie, and thank you for sharing. I'll be sure to keep my eyes open the next time I'm down there.",

      "text": "Hi Derek. My name is Brandy. I'm from southeast Texas and I have listened for a long time and this is my first call in. So I'm calling in with an alien black cat story just for you. I moved into a new house and I moved in in August and this happened around November. I work night, so I leave work at about 6am I get home at about 6:36, 35. So this would have been about 6, 26, 25 in the morning, still dark like I said November. So longer nights still full on dark, more or less at 6 in the morning. So I was driving home and I take a back road that kind of circles around my hometown. And it's kind of tightly packed with people up until a certain point. And then the yards get bigger, the spaces open up, but it stays a little narrow two lane road. Now this road circles back around my town past like a big drainage ditch that runs from the middle of town out into the fields and between the neighborhoods on one side and a big cemetery on the other. Now there's a little bridge that goes over, like I said, this giant drainage ditch. And coming around the corner on my way to the drainage ditch. So there's still houses on my left hand side and there's the cemetery on my right hand side almost to this bridge. And this really big for a cat, black cat, about the size of a good sized German shepherd. But it didn't move like a dog. It moved like a cat jumps from down in the grass on the left hand side of my car straight through my headlights. So it's not like I couldn't see what I was looking at straight through my headlights. Dark, dark black, little light cubby ears. I know that sounds stupid, but like little cat ears but rounded like panthers kind of like that. I cannot for the life of me remember if it had a tail or not. But it cleared this two lane road in one jump like it had front paws on the street on the left hand side, back paws in the grass and jumped and made it to front paws in the grass and back paws on the paved part of the road on the other side. And then it was gone. I mean it's weird because it was still in the middle of town, but on that side of town where the yards start to open up and the houses aren't quite as tight together. We do see a lot of deer. So I mean it wouldn't be weird that something that you know could eat deer would be out there. But it was the only time I've seen it. I haven't seen anything since I didn't hear anything around the time about, you know, like, pets or anything going missing. Nobody else that I've talked to in town has ever seen anything like it. So I don't know, maybe I'm just crazy. But I just wanted to call in and tell you about it. Thanks so much for the podcast. It's a great platform for us weirdos to call in and let other people know about the weird stuff that we see. Good luck. I hope you and Sarah are doing okay and that's all. Okay, bye.",

It's funny that Brandy would mention that the big cat was seen in town and that she thought maybe that took away a bit from the credibility. Well, I come from a very small town myself. So small that they don't even call it a town. They refer to it as a village. But my brother, my brother was police chief there for several years and my mom lives right there in town to this day. And both my brother and my mother have claimed to see something similar. A large, black, big cat within village limits. In fact, I'm pretty sure both stories were featured on the very first episode of this program back when I had to hunt down stories. Thankfully, they now come to me. And thankfully, they're almost always amazing tales, just like Brandy's. So thank you again for taking the time to share.

Been planning on calling in about a few things, but didn't expect this to be how my first call would be because I just had something happen to me on the road tonight. So not an over road driver, but I definitely put in probably about anywhere between 600 and 800 miles a week. On the road, driving a week and up in northern Illinois tonight, in November here, it's our first snow. But I was driving a stretch of road I'm very used to right near my hometown. And the craziest thing is I'm coming around this one corner that we normally have, and I'm used to there being all types of lights from all types of vehicles. We get a lot of farm equipment out there and stuff. And this was not a light I've never come around the corner to. And for just a half a second, it was way more encompassing of everything being bright than I'm used to. And then, I swear, in my view, just as I'm driving up, it looked like this light almost transformed. It's really hard to explain, but it's like the light almost folded in on itself. And then it came out to look like a light. More like the front lights of kind of like a truck with maybe some extra LED tops on it or something, when you're thinking some of the just guys with the raised trucks to look something more normal. But it went from a form and a shade of light as I was turning this corner that I said, and I have goosebumps just around this because I just drove up the road and pulled over because this is weird, but oh, my gosh, I swear that light just transformed right in front of me to make it look more like a car. And I don't know if this is some trickster thing, I don't know. But just ever since I started driving around that corner almost before the lights, I swear I've just had my goosebumps up and my skin crawling, feeling like something is in the air, like an electricity. And this was weird. I don't know what the classified other than weird lights on the road, but I don't know what to say. I did not expect to see this on the road tonight. Be safe out there. Keep doing what you're doing, because we need places where we can talk about this weird stuff. Man, this is crazy on the streets. Have a good day.",

      "text": "Thank you, Mac. No, I don't know this as a fact, but it sounds right to me. I bet a majority of UFO sightings are made by people in vehicles, especially drivers, because think about it. They're surrounded by windows, they're bored out of their gourd, and their eyes are glued to the landscape in front of them, or at least they should be. So you would think that that combination would make them more susceptible to sightings. So I suppose none of this surprises me, Mac. But regardless, thank you again for sharing your experience.

      "text": "Hello, I'm calling from San Marcos, Texas. I wanted to share an eerie experience I had this past October 2024. I walk regularly each day for exercise. However, I had some medical skin treatments and was to stay out of the sun for three weeks. So I decided to walk a half hour before dawn. For that time I started out by walking down a semi steep street. Street terminates at a T intersection which has a lone street light. There appeared to be an unusual person in the middle of the street walking down towards the T intersection. It was not quite 2/3 of the way down the street here what seemed to have a wide stance and the legs were much longer than normal. Very much disproportionate to the body. He was tall. It had a jerking shaking movement. I was gaining on him and I was wondering if he was using stilts or something. Got a little closer, maybe about 60ft from him. I could see white legs at the end of the pant legs and socks and shoes. His pant legs looked a little too short for the leg. Maybe about a foot short. I say. An animal starts scattering in all directions from him. Cat started to the right, deer to the left. Other animals were too blurry to identify. I started to feel the hair raised on the back of my neck and goosebumps on my arms. Strange person made it to the T intersection before me. His back was too me and appeared to be standing still looking at the house on the left. As I approached it sensed that I was there. It said sort of the turn about 10 degrees only and then the whole body started turning in a staggering shuffling motion. My eyes were locked on the back of his head. I was terrified and my gut instinct seemed to warn me not to look at his face. I turned right quickly at the T intersection. That street goes up a steep incline. I was up to the top quicker than ever before. I stopped doing the pre dawn walks and still have uneasy memory of the event. I'm 70 and never experienced anything like this. Now I often wonder what if I had looked at his face.",

Different creatures but a similar scenario and the same spooky results.

      "text": "Hey Derek, this is Dustin from central Oregon. I thought about calling for a long time because I saw something when I was probably 10 or 12 hunting with my dad in the Ochikos. And I wasn't sure if it pertained to the Mirrored Men. But the more I listen to stories the more I'm kind of thinking about it and it kind of scares me a lot. When I was little, the first time I went hunting with my dad, we went out into the Ochakos and we went with my grandfather, my mom's dad and he had a trailer. And in the back of the trailer, there was a bunk bed, and I slept on the top bunk. And there were two sides to the trailer, and both sides had, like, a little porthole window so you can, like, look out. Well, two or three days in, I can't really remember to the trip, it started snowing really bad, like, blizzard style. And we were in the mountains, and we didn't really have anything. And so my dad was kind of just waiting to figure out whether or not we would need to go back into town and cancel our trip or if we could continue hunting. And that night, I was just. I don't know if I was asleep at that point or if I had woken up or if I had still been up, but I was, like, up. And I looked over towards. Because the. The campground was only maybe, like, a couple hundred yards away from, like, the gravel mountain road that, like, led out into the woods. And then there were, like, campgrounds on either side of the road. So we were only a couple hundred yards away from the road. And it was pouring snow outside. Not, like, heavy, like, where it was, like, heavy wind. It was just like, there were huge snowflakes falling, like, consistently, probably about a foot of snow outside. And I saw three identical figures walking down the road. And they looked like they had, like, towels, like, big black towels on their shoulders. They all looked exactly the same. Nobody had, like, anything in their hands like in previous stories. They were just walking together down the road. And I felt very, very, very, very strongly that they could see me and that they knew that I was looking at them. None of them looked at me. And like, so many of the stories say, like, one or all of them will, like, turn their heads to look. I felt very strongly that they were going to do that at any moment, but they never did and just walked back, like, by the camp and then down the road. And I always thought, you know, they're probably, like, more hunters, like, going to the camp. Like, they had been hiking all day, and then they were just going back. And then they had black, like, shaws on because of the snow. Like, and then, of course, they would all have, like, sort of the same thing. But the more that I hear these stories about the mirrored men, the more it terrifies me. And for some reason, that's always terrified me, that experience. And the more I hear about the mirrored men, the more it terrifies me, and it keeps making me remember that story. So, yeah, I'm in central Oregon. We were hunting in the Ochaco Mountain range, and that's it. Thank you so much.",

And those details are as three men dressed the same and walking in unison? Check. The feeling of dread or that you're being watched? Check. Bad, strange or inclement weather? Also check. Which means the only characteristic I think is missing in this account is the absence of missing time, one of the key elements of a Mirrored man encounter. Now, that doesn't mean what he witnessed that evening was not the mirrored man, but it is something worth noting. And whatever it was he saw, it certainly sounds downright terrifying. So thank you.
