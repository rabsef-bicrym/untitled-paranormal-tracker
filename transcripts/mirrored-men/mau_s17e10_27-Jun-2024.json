I am your guide, Derek Hayes. Welcome folks to another installment of your favorite paranormal call in show. I have quite the specimen on display for you here this evening. Calls about shadow entities, winged weirdos, synchronized strangers, and a whole lot more. And of course, to the best of my knowledge, each and every call shared here on the program is 100% factual. They've all been submitted via my 24. 7 hotline that I'll share more about here in a bit. And in addition to all that, each call shared tonight is downright hair raising, beginning with this wicked experience from Joe up there in Big Sky Country. Hey, this is Joe. I'm from Montana. I've been listening to your podcast all day today. Some of your stories reminded me of a story quite a long time ago. Back in high school, me and four of my friends actually went to a Cemetery we have here in Missoula. And we decided going there for a little trip. So we went in, there's five of us. I was in the front, me, another guy and two girls. But the cemetery leads up to the highway, so we decided to jump the fence and go up to the back of the cemetery and back. And so it took. We were there about 9:30 at night. It took us maybe an hour to do. And then it was kind of spooky quiet and just had a weird feeling about being there. And so we got all the way up to the highway, it was pretty quiet. Then we did up there for a little bit, turned around, came back to the gate and my friend jumped over the fence. I helped the two girls jumped the fence and then I jumped the fence and we only had two cars. And so once I landed on the outside of the fence, I saw a six foot black snake like thing go from underneath my friend's car to underneath my car. And so I wounded up having one of my friends drive my car and we took the girls home. One of the girls was on the other side of town, so we took her home first. And then we went to the fort here in Missoula. And I was having my friend drive and we got almost to the fort and my friend slammed on the brakes and he slid and pre woke us all up. And I looked at him and I asked him, what, what the hell was he doing? And his face was like, he's seen something, I don't know, like pale white. And I asked him, what's wrong? And he told me that he just hit somebody. I looked at him like, what are you talking about? He's like, I literally just hit somebody. And so me, him and the other. Guy, we all got out of the. Car, we walked back to where the skid mark started and there was no body, no nothing. It was a crystal clear night. And the three of us started walking back to the car and one of the girls took a picture of us. And there was orbs everywhere in the picture. And faintly, there was four of us in the picture, not just three. But that's my story. I really love hearing your podcast and keep it spooky. Bye. Thank you, Joe. Now, as terrifying as it might be to hit someone with your vehicle only for them to disappear into the darkness, but we've covered that plenty of times here in the program. Instead, let's focus on the strange snake that Joe saw prior to the accident. The show is called Monsters Among Us. After all, what's more monstrous than a Giant snake. But to be honest, six foot isn't very big for a snake. The largest snake found in Montana is the bull snake or the gopher snake, which can grow up to seven feet in length. I actually saved two of these beauties off local roads in the last couple of weeks while out riding my dune buggy. They can get sizable and sometimes ornery, but nothing that I would label a monster. However, giant snakes have been in the news lately. Just a few weeks ago it was announced that fossils from what is now known as the largest snake to ever slither the earth were found. They call it Vasuki indictus. So what would you do if you found a snake as long as a school bus and as heavy as a car? You're not going to but researchers found these snake fossils near a coal mine in India. They discovered it was a species they'd never seen before. They named it Vasuki indicus after a mythical Hindi snake king. According to the journal Scientific Reports, the snake could have been between 36 and 50ft long. Now because of its size, researchers think it was a very slow moving creature. They believe it lived around 47 million years ago. So don't go looking for one. But that's interesting. I love when they find new species or new animals that we had no idea even exist. Now that clip courtesy of KVUE ABC News out of Austin. And imagine running into one of those snakes. Joe, you think a six foot black snake is spooky? How about a snake the size of a tanker truck? Now on a somewhat related note, there was a video released recently in where an elderly woman was attacked and eaten by a python over in Indonesia. Now I'm not going to play a clip from those tragic events or anything, but I will link to it in the show notes if you're interested. Morbidly curious. And believe it or not, that snake was only about 16ft long. So just imagine what the Vasuki indictus would have been capable of. But it's now long extinct and half a world away. So Joe in Montana has nothing to worry about, right? Well, not so fast, my friend. Depending on which part of Montana he's in, he could be relatively close to a body of water that's said to harbor a snake like creature that's just as large as the Vasuki indictus and it even has a cute cartoonish name. They call it the Manapogo. One of the great figures in Canadian folklore lies somewhere in the depths of Lake Manitoba. The Manipogo sea monster. The monster is predicted to be anywhere from 12 to 50ft long depending depending on the eyewitness. Sightings of the monster go back centuries, with indigenous people of the surrounding areas telling oral legends of a serpent like creature in the lake. In 1948, C.P. Alrich reported a large creature that rose from the lake and gave a dinosaur esque cry. Similarly, the snake like creature was spotted. By a couple in the 1960s no. More than 60 yards from their boat. In 2004, a commercial fisherman reported that several of his fishing nets that were cast near the narrows had been torn. Up with damage similar to what a. Shark or killer whale would do in the ocean. Although the descriptions vary, there's no question that something strange lurks in Lake Manitoba. Now that clip via the Travel Manitoba TikTok page, a tourism account for the area and I'd have to think a snake that size would spend most of its time in the water, where its weight and girth wouldn't be so much of a burden. Not too unlike the giant anacondas that still roam the earth today. And up that direction there are a lot of bodies of water, so a giant snake like creature cruising the waters of south central Canada sort of makes a bit of sense to me. Can they survive the long, treacherous winter? That's the real question. Either way, thank you Joe for allowing me to go on a bit of a giant snake tangent. I've been wanting to share that recent discovery for some time now, and I'm pretty excited that I finally got to do it. This episode is brought to you by Progressive Insurance.

All right, this next one is a strange one. But how Aren't they all K from Pennsylvania? Tell us how yours might be different. Hi Derek, My name is K. I'm from the suburbs of Philadelphia and this is actually where the story happened. It was in one of the houses we lived in when I was very young, I was about five years old, my parents bought this old farmhouse, this old stone farmhouse. It was a very big move for them. There's a lot of stories about this house that I can get into later, but. Or not. But the one thing specifically I wanted to talk about is because something happened in this house that I haven't heard anybody else talk about and I want to see if anybody else has had this experience. So I was about 5 years old at this point. When we lived in the house, I would be in the kitchen with my mom a lot of the time, and one wall in the kitchen facing southwest. Every once in a while this would happen where the wall would start to shimmer and glimmer to me. And I remember thinking it was so funny and laughing. My mom really didn't like this, didn't see this happening. The wall would start to move. It would separate from the wall, the shimmering square, and would move across the room towards the opposite wall. I would be sitting at the table when this happened. It happened multiple times. I remember that I would giggle and laugh. I thought it was so funny. My mom really didn't like it when it would pass through me on the other side. It like felt funny and I would laugh and it got to the point where my mom would yell at me when this would happen because I think she would get so upset she didn't like this house. She told me later a lot of things about this house really freaked her out. She told me I used to call it the shimmer wall. I don't remember saying that, but I'll. Take her word for it. I know this sounds crazy, but I remember it very vividly. And I listened to a lot of podcasts and your podcast, which I love. I haven't heard anything like this and maybe it was my imagination, but maybe not. And I guess I'm just sharing it to see if anybody else had a similar experience. Thank you. I enjoy your podcast. It's great. Bye. Thank you. Kay. How about it, folks? Anyone ever experienced something strange like this or has anyone ever even heard of anything like this? It doesn't seem to ring any bells with me. Certainly doesn't jog any memories. But if you do have some information or any true paranormal story you would like to share here on the program, call our hotline at 888-608-night. That's 888608, Nig HT.

And please, if you get cut off, call back in and finish the story. Otherwise, I'm left with half a tail that I can do nothing with. Again, that number is 888608 NIGHT. Now tonight's subsequent call comes to us from my state of California, Tina. Welcome to the show. Hi Derek, this is Tina from Northern California. I was listening to somebody talking about seeing a person in the middle of the road in the middle of nowhere. And that got me remembering something that happened to me when I was around 20. I was living by myself in a little apartment up there in the foothills. So like below Tahoe area. So it's kind of woodsy, it's not very dense with like neighborhoods and stuff. There's houses everywhere, but it's pretty spread out. So I went to visit a friend who lived about a mile away from me in the same little town. And I left her house around, I don't know, 11, 11:30. It was really late. And as I'm leaving her house, it's a little tiny spirit lane that goes downhill and turns and then there's this 90 degree turn to go back up towards the main road to go back to my house. But as you're coming to this 90 degree turn, there's just nothing. It's all like prairie or meadow. I guess you would say it was more of a meadow, trees way off in the distance, but there's nothing there. So as I'm driving, the only Lights are my headlights. It's totally quiet, no street lights. And I see something laying just past the 90 degree turn. You know, my eyes are trying to figure out what the heck I'm seeing. As I get closer to it, it looks like a woman is laying down with her back towards me on her side with. I remember she just had like long hair all strewn out and jeans and I don't know what kind of shirt she was wearing, but I laid there. I mean, I sat there and watched her laying there. Like, what am I seeing? This, this isn't right. And all of a sudden I just got like so scared. And I've seen a lot of stuff in my life and I have not ever really been scared. Like, things are creepy, a little perplexing, but. But this like made everything, every hair. On my body stand up. So I booked it out there and I went to my apartment and I woke up my roommate and I was like, I just saw a person laying in the field. Like, I think I saw a dead body. And he's like, well, let's go. So he jumps out of bed, we go back, we drive by, and right away I can see there's nothing there. But I drive by, I drive all the way down, I flip the U turn and I recreate the scene. So I'm coming up and there's nothing there. There's no log, there's no rocks, there's no bush leaves. There's nothing on the ground where I saw this person. And I was like, I swear to God it was there. And he just says, yes, I believe you. I totally believe you. Let's get out and look around. And I was so overwhelmed with like, just like, this is a trap. We can't get out of the car. This. Something's really wrong. We have to just go. And he's like, let's get out, let's look. I said, nope, no, we're leaving, we gotta go home. And just booked it home and tried to go to bed, but that was super spooky. And I can still picture the hair and the person laying there. So I don't know what that was, but I just wanted to share that I hope you like my story and I love this podcast. Thank you. Bye. Thank you for calling in, Tina. Now, if I didn't know any better, I'd say that you had a run in with the little known but much feared beast of the Sierras known simply as Penelope. Here is what the website Weird California has to say about this monstrous maiden. Every now and then, someone sees or runs across a large, vicious, horrid humanoid creature roaming the Sierra Nevadas. Said to be a female, thin and 7ft tall, with long arms and long legs, a deformed face and long, dirty, light colored hair. This bestial creature is known as Penelope, and she is the subject of urban legend in the area. Park rangers have documented a few strange sightings over the years in the Sierra Nevada mountains, and these encounters have been attributed to this creature, who for some reason is referred to as Penelope. She has been described as wearing no clothes, looking like a beastial giant witch, and rumored to be lightning fast with razor sharp claws. She has supposedly disemboweled or even decapitated her victims before they even realize she is there. Moving so fast they have no time to react before she is upon them. Who is she? Where did she come from? No one is sure. But the short version of the urban legend describes her as a woman who became lost in the Sierra Nevadas and somehow turned into this flesh eating monster that terrorizes the region today. Well, that's spooky stuff and certainly seems similar to what Tina just described, except for one minor detail. Did you happen to catch it? That's right. It was the hair color. Tina described the hair on the entity she saw as dark brown or black. And historically, Penelope's hair, whatever the hell she might be, is often said to be blonde or light colored. I have two thoughts here. Firstly, I read several reports that also claim Penelope has dark hair as well. But those more reputable sources suggested a lighter hue. So maybe there's some sort of mix up there. But you know, I have an explanation for this little discrepancy. You see, even some light colored hair looks dark when it's wet and matted. So perhaps in the darkness, and if the mystery figure was sporting sopping wet locks, the color was incorrectly identified. Perhaps the entity's hair seemed darker because of its filthy state. Well, either way, we do appreciate the call, Tina. It's not every day I get to talk about Penelope, but trust me, whenever I'm up in the Sierra Nevadas, she's on the forefront of my mind. And speaking of discrepancies, last week I made a rare mistake and accidentally said that Crystal, who actually hails from Washington state, was from Canada. Well, I clearly got some wires crossed there, and for that I apologize. And a big thanks, I guess, to everyone that pointed out my mistake. It ain't the first and it certainly won't be the last, but we do our best to stay factual here on the show. So I wanted to clear that little mistake up. Now, moving on, I can do one more story before we have to take another break. So if you would please join me in welcoming Lily to tonight's program. Hi, Derek. I love your podcast and your fan stories, and I was introduced to your podcast by my boyfriend, and my story is about aliens. So basically, this incident occurred on June 17th of 2020 and it was around 1:20 in the morning. And at the time I had shared a room with my brother and we were talking together late at night because it was summer. And I went to the bathroom and I came back and he told me he had heard a strange noise. And at first I didn't really believe him because I thought he was trying to prank me or scare me or something like that. So we were in our room together and it was probably about 20 minutes since then, and he was telling me maybe the noise would come back because he really wanted me to hear it because he couldn't believe the noise he heard. So we had continued our conversation and later on in the night, I heard the noise. And this noise still scares me till this day. And the easiest way I can explain it is that it sounded like an alien ship either landing or taking off. And the sound was very, very close. It sounded like it was maybe a few houses down from us, if that. The sound was very tacky and eerie all at the same time. And my brother and I just kind of looked at each other and we froze and we ran to our parents room and we woke up our dad and we told him the noise we heard. And he came to our room basically to try to see if he could hear this sound that we heard. And of course no sound ever came back. So in total, we only heard this sound twice. My brother heard it twice and I heard it once. And my brother and I probably stayed up till about four in the morning just to see if we can hear it again. And you know, we were discussing all the possibilities of what it could be. You know, honestly, truly, to this day, I believe it was something to do with aliens. It just. It sounded so much like a ship landing. I just can't explain it. I tried looking on YouTube of certain sounds and I can't really pinpoint an exact sound, but it does sound very, very similar to something like that. When I was researching though, that night, I found one article and it was talking about something called the hum, which claims to be a widespread low frequency humming, rumbling, or droning sound, which is not audible to all people. And this is the only thing I can possibly think of to explain this or I don't know, maybe it really was an alien ship landing. But you know, to this day I have no idea what it really was and I've not heard this sound since. And I'm just curious to know if anybody else has heard this sound because it was so close and you know, it was just very, very scary to hear this late at night. Thank you so much for listening to my story. Thank you, Lily. That is very unsettling. And if you want my professional opinion, I'm not sure this is related to the infamous hum activity at all. Several places around the world have them. The Taos Hum in New Mexico, for example, or the Auckland Hum in New Zealand, or the Windsor Hum in Canada. This phenomenon does exist. But to me this sounds somehow much more ominous, if that makes any sense. And I have that opinion because I have another report I'm going to share in tonight's beyond episode that seems to share many, if not all of the attributes in Lilly's encounter. So be sure to stick around for that and I'll tell you how you can tune in and even do it for free at the very end of this program. So I'll save any further commentary until then, but I will say thank you, Lily, once again for calling in. I'm excited to compare these two unsettling entries.

Moments before they sell out. Okay, so this next entry takes psychic ability to creepy extremes. Christine from Washington state, welcome to the show. Hi, Derek. My name is Christine. I'm calling from Washington. But my story or my experience took place in Southern California. I only think that this would be a supernatural story based off of what has happened since then. But it might be a let's not meet story because it has to do with a medium and something that they told me a few years back. So this happened in the summer of 2004. And I remember that because I turned 18 and I was working at a pool as a lifeguard. I was checking everyone in, which means I was in the front of the building. Mind you, I'm 18, I'm wearing a bathing suit and pretty much nothing else. And I'm by myself at the front. So I was very cautious of people. And as I'm checking, everyone in a family comes in that I don't recognize. And a man with long hair, dark skin, and he came up and he was kind of creepy, but I think he was just trying to be nice and I just was not comfortable. He said, I need to read you. And I was confused. Now I'm like, fine. He's like, I'm a medium. And they're telling me, I need to talk to you. And I was like, okay. And he had to be in his 30s or something, but he then followed his family and said. He said, I'm going to come back and talk to you. And I was like, no, thank you. But he left and the lines died down. Everyone was going inside. And I had about like 20 more minutes till I needed to close cash and go out. And I called my manager on the walkie talkie and I was like, hey, I got creeped out. Can I. Can I close up early? 15 minutes early? He's like, yeah, sure. Do you need me out there? And I'm like, no, it's okay. I'm just going to close out early. Just let you know. So I was closing out 15 minutes earlier, and this guy comes running back out from the showers, right? And he runs. He says, I'm glad I Caught you. I need to talk to you. And I was like, what? So I'm alone with this older man and I'm, you know, uncomfortable. I'm in a bathing suit, I'm. I'm nervous, right? And he starts telling me all these things and he starts, he's like, can I read your poem? And you know, I was, ladies, especially young girls, if you feel uncomfortable, tell them no, it's okay. And I was not in that kind of mindset. And I, I gave in. I just handed my hand over to them. And he starts reading my poem and he starts, like, rubs my arm. And I'm feeling so uncomfortable and thinking, this guy's just a creep. He's just a creep. Well, he starts saying some stuff. The first thing he says was, well, you're not a virgin. And I was like, well, that's like, of course. Like, what a creepy thing to say. Like, you're just creepy, right? And I'm like, okay. I didn't really give a confirmation. I just said, okay, move on. And then he said, okay. So it looks like you're gonna have like a nice life. Like, your lifeline is healthy. You're gonna have a good life. I see that you're gonna get married, but you're gonna get married twice. And the problem is I can't see whether it's by death or divorce, but you are gonna get married twice. And I was like, well, that doesn't give me any answers. That tells me nothing. Like, you can't tell if it's death or divorce, but you're just saying I'm going to get, like, something has to happen, right? So I just, okay, this crazy. Like, that's weird. And then he gets really somber and he says, I'm really sorry to tell you this, but you're going to have three children and one of them is going to die. And I just, my heart kind of dropped and I was like, like, what? Why are you doing this to me? You know, like, what kind of what? Like, you're such a weirdo. You're so creepy. Like, why are you doing this? And I'm thinking this man is like just here to make me uncomfortable. And he did tell me other things. He read other things on my palm, I guess, and I don't remember them because I was so upset. And like, I'm shaking now just remembering like that feeling. But he did tell me other things. I just don't remember them. So I was obviously upset because who says that to an 18 year old? Like, your kid's gonna die. And so I went to my manager and I was visibly upset and I was crying and I said, the guy came back and I told him all the things that he told me. I told him that, you know, he said, it's gonna die. And like, I was just very upset. And my manager, who is atheist and he's does not believe in anything. And he was like, you have to ignore that. Like, that guy was just a weirdo. Like, he's just. Why would anyone say that? Someone in upset. Look how upset you are. Why would someone like, like that was. We don't worry about it. He's just messing with you, essentially. Well, I kind of shake it off and I move on. And you know, years start passing and I start dating my now husband. And we've been together, we're celebrating our 15 year anniversary this year. But you know, a few years after that, I would say three to four years after that. And I'm talking with one of my friends and she's telling me, swapping like paranormal stories essentially. And I was like, yeah, I had this. I had a supernatural thing. I'd say, well, I guess, I don't know. I don't know if I believe in mediums because you might think it's not supernatural, that it's just, yeah, there's mediums in the world. And then you might see it how I see it, where I didn't believe in them. And then something happened and we're telling and I start explaining what he said to me and relaying this story again. And when me and my husband got married, he was being deployed, he was in Afghanistan. And I planned the wedding. He was gone. And he called me and said, you have to cancel, I'm not coming home. So I canceled the wedding. Luckily, he did actually come back fairly close to our original date. But I had canceled the wedding because I didn't know when he would be back. So we ended up having a courthouse wedding and it was really quick, it was just family and we just got it done because I was like, well, we already plan on getting married. I want to get married. And anyways, we did. And then the same year I was pregnant and my daughter, I became preeclamptic and I went into. She was prematurely born through via emergency C section and she did not survive. I almost didn't survive. She lived about a week in the nicu. Her body just wasn't developed enough and so we had to let her go. And so she passed and. Sorry. So anyways, I was telling my friend about that and I was explaining I was like, I. When I got a tattoo like, of my daughter's name, I put one big flower and then I put two smaller flowers. And I don't know why. I think I just aesthetically, I liked it. But I had always said, like, oh, well, we're going to redo our. Our wedding because we had to have a courthouse wedding. And now it's coming up on. We're celebrating 15 years this year. And we were just talking about how on our 20th anniversary we're going to do a renewal of our vows. And that would be a second wedding that wasn't because of death or divorce. I have two children, surviving children right now. So I had three children and one passed. It's strange because it took so many years for this all to come to pass. And I didn't believe it at first. I was wanting to shake it off as a person who just wanted to make someone uncomfortable. But now I see that it was supernatural and it was years and years coming. So I guess the point of the call is that sometimes you have these experiences and it just takes years and years for you to see it. I appreciate it. Love your show. Big fan. Thanks again. Bye. Oh, Christine, I'm sorry for your loss, but thank you for having the courage to share your experience and what an impactful experience it was. And a powerful premonition as well, albeit a tragic and life altering one. Now, you know, the rational side of my brain wants to write this off to coincidence. Maybe the guy just made a guess trying to impress young Christine and simply got lucky. It could happen. But that's a fairly bold thing to predict, and it certainly doesn't help him out in the flirting department. That is a mood killer right there. So that same logically thinking half of my brain tells me that if it was an attempt to woo poor Christine, it was a doomed attempt from the start. Which makes me think that it's likely that wasn't the man's intention. And that's when the imaginative side of my noggin begins churning and I start asking the tough questions. Who are they that told him he must speak with Christine? How was the information delivered? And why on earth did he feel the need to share it? Then that leads me to remember my own premonitions and how they've probably come off is creepy as well. After all, I did out several pregnancies unprovoked. And hopefully I wasn't as skeezy about it as the man that approached our caller. But regardless of what it was or how it happened, I am very sorry that it did. Christine.

I'll tell you one thing now folks. Next up is an entry from Ashley in Parts Unknown. Hi Derek, this is Ashley. I only recently found your show a few weeks ago and I'm only in season five. But I love the show and I decided to go ahead and call in with this experience. So in 2015 myself and two of my girl cousins decided to go on a girls trip to St. Augustine. We are all really interested in the paranormal so we love to do ghost tours and historical tours of the area that we visit. On this particular day in St. Augustine we rented some bikes and we were riding around and it was the evening at this time and I had decided to show them a chapel and that's located off of San Marcos Ave. Because I had an experience there and I'll call back another time about that experience. So Anyways, we ride along a side street to see this chapel called lady of Leche Chapel. It's located in a cemetery. So we're on the side street and across from the chapel are houses. So we check out the chapel, we turn around and we just happened to look up at one of the houses there. And there was a man standing in the window. He was wearing all black. He was not transparent. He was wearing a very large, wide brim hat. You can clearly see like, you know, his outline of his shoulders. But the man had no distinguishable facial features. They were all kind of blacked out. I did reach out to my cousins before recording this to make sure that what I saw was the same thing that they saw. And they did confirm the same details. So after seeing that man, obviously it scared us. So we rode away quickly on our bikes. But we did stop near the end of the street with just, you know, maybe like 20 seconds, seconds later. And we turned around to take a look at the house, but obviously there was nothing there. So the next day we revisited the area and as expected, there was nothing in the window. And located where the chapel is, there is also a church with a gift shop. And that gift shop is actually run by nuns. So we go inside to check it out. And my curiosity got the best of me and I decided to start up a convo with the nun. And I asked her, you know, if the church owns the houses across the street. And she said that they do. And I asked her if priests live there. She said that they do, the clergy lives there. And then I asked her, you know, what the priests normally wear. And she proceeded to say that, you know, on their off days they just wear regular clothes. So I asked her if in particular do they wear long black overcoat type robes with wide brim hats? And she said that they do wear robes, but they are not long black ones. And for this particular time of the year that the priests are currently wearing white robes with like purple decorations on them for the mass. But that's only during the mass. So I just thanked her for her time and we left. Never really revisited this experience or thought about it much until I started listening. But I did think to myself that even if it were a priest or a person that was in that window, what they were wearing was like very, very odd, especially for Florida, because in Florida there are only two seasons, it's either hot or hotter. And you know, it'd be weird for someone to be wearing like a long overcoat inside the house and a wide brim hat, especially in the middle of the night. It just, it didn't make sense to me. So that's really it. Thank you and keep up the good work. Derek. Love the show. Thank you Ashley for the phone call. Now this is one of those types of stories that at first sounds really extraordinary, but when you think about it and break down the events, it could be easily explained. You see, it's simple. Perhaps there was a man up there, or perhaps a mannequin or dress form that was holding a costume or uniform. And maybe whatever it was was simply moved the following morning from the street view, it looked just as though there was someone or something standing up there. But in reality it was just a trick of the eye. Then again, I was not there and I do not know all that Ashley knows. So maybe there's more to this experience or perhaps it was simply something supernatural that is yet to be explained. But I love Ashley's gumption. Asking the nun working the gift shop was a great addition to the story. So thank you Ashley for both the call and for digging down deeper for the truth.

I think that's enough of a tease. Wouldn't want to give anything away. Mac from Illinois, welcome back to. Hey Derek, it's Mac from Illinois. Told you I'd call back. So I'm listening to Season 15, Episode 7 and My Story that I'm about to tell you. You can probably mark it under a military special if you wish. So as I'm listening to this episode, you're talking about the Mirrored man. And suddenly it triggered a memory from something, an incident that happened while I was out training one year. So this was about somewhere in the late 90s, I think. So this one night we were out training, we're driving around and it's dark. There's no lights anywhere. Of course we're under blackout condition. We stop and we huddle up with our platoon sergeant to talk about what's going to happen next. As we're standing there, there's a whole group of us, probably about 12 people. And to my left in the Woods. I hear something. And I wasn't the only one. I looked over one of my squad mates. I said, hey, you hear that? It sounds like somebody's walking over there. And like, yeah, okay, let's go check it out. So of course we do our thing. We go over and walk over toward the wood line a little bit, and I step in behind some bushes, and I swear to you, Derek, I heard three men walking towards us in the woods. I walked out a little further, and sure enough, I see three black shadows, fully dressed soldiers walking towards us. Here's what's weird. I'm not the only one who saw these three men. So I start calling out, halt. Who's there? Halt. Stop. You know, the whole gamut of what we're supposed to do. They weren't stopping. They kept walking. My two squad mates were to my right and behind me. They did the same thing. They were calling out, hey, halt. Stop. Whatever. You know, they were there. They weren't stopping. We were challenging them. And I swear we were muzzle to muzzle. And these guys kept coming at us. Suddenly, my platoon sergeant says, hey, what's going on over there? He says, I got soldiers in front of me. They're not stopping. We're challenging them. And he walks over a little ways and he says, there's nothing there. And as soon as he said that, Derek, those shapes that I saw as three men suddenly disappeared and turned into trees, I didn't see trees. When I walked into that wood line, I saw a slightly open area with three fully dressed soldiers in black shadow outline walking towards us. My squad mates agreed there was men there because otherwise none of us would have challenged them. So I can mark this under, what did we see? Was it just trick of the light and we just thought we saw something, or was there something there that suddenly disappeared as soon as he said something? I don't know. It's a good question. Your guess is as good as mine. I'd love any kind of theories. Talk to you later. Thank you, Mac. The mirrored men. Now, for those of you that are living under a rock, the mirrored men is a phenomena that I uncovered all the way back on the first season of this program, I shared a story my friend had been telling me since college about three men that look and move identically and that are associated with bouts of missing time. We later learned that strange weather and strange facial details also often find their way into Meerdman reports. But this is the first I've ever heard of these odd entities turning into a tree or even blending into their surroundings, and there didn't seem to be any mention of missing time or odd or inclement weather as well. And their appearance as soldiers is certainly brand new to me. So you decide for yourself. Was this a true Mirrored man experience or something that somehow just seems similar now? Since we're talking about the infamous Mirrored Man, I thought this would be a great opportunity to share a story I found recently on a website I frequent called Phantoms and Monsters, a collection of written accounts from researcher Lon Strickler. This story was originally obtained by our friends at Expanded Perspectives. I grew up in a small town and this particular thing happened in an even smaller town. I was 16. My best friend and I worked at a fast food restaurant. Our boyfriends normally picked us up from work and if it was early enough or the weekend, we usually went to one of our homes. If not, he'd drop me off at home. My mom was very lenient so I didn't have to tell her what I was doing. She knew who I was with and knew I'd be home. Now this night happened to be Halloween and instead of the usual, somebody had the idea to ride around before we had to be home. It was around 8pm There was an old long closed cement plant in the smaller town and from the sounds of sounded pretty creepy. I had only heard of it before and that night found myself on my way there. I wasn't afraid, just going with the flow and having fun with my friends. It was myself, my best friend, another girl and her two boyfriends in the car. The old plant used to be a thriving, active business, built in the early 1900s but had long closed down. It was situated along the outskirts of town along a very long two lane dark road with no street lights. It was well past any residential area. We drove out to the plant which took about 15 minutes. My boyfriend was driving, I was in the front passenger seat and the other three were in the back. We pulled up to the plant which was on our left, but my boyfriend did a U turn and parked along the fence so the plant is now on our right. We were all talking, just saying how old the place was and what it must have been like to see it in its earlier days. There were machine parts and metal and other debris all over the large lot. Even in the dark you could make out the junk. We hadn't been there maybe five minutes when the two guys decided to get out and get closer to the fence for a more dramatic experience. It truly wasn't scary, but the other guys were making noises trying to scare us girls. We all started laughing but immediately stopped. Out of nowhere lights came on in the doorways windows of the abandoned building. It was as if somebody turned on a light switch that lit up 20 or 30 windows at the same time. In the lights were standing these huge buff, tall, idle standing men that had long hair. They didn't walk up to the light, they were already in the light. They didn't appear to be standing behind the structures of the building on the inside, but on the outside of the building as if on a balcony or ledge. All the men were uniform, all the same size and stature, not saying a word, not moving. They had balled up fists and seemed to have work boots on. I didn't notice any wind blowing before, but you could see their long hair blowing softly in the wind, all in unison. You could see their huge arm muscles, but strangely these things were featureless. You could assume that they were men, but their bodies were like shadows, blacker than black. You could not make out any facial features or clothing. Nothing. They just stood there, perfectly still. I don't know how long before my friend broke the silence with her scream, but we were mesmerized. We were only staring for a few seconds, but it felt like 100 minutes. She screamed and the two boys ran back to the car. We flew out of the dirt packed area by the fence, along the road and back onto the pavement and rode completely in silence. My boyfriend was the first to ask what had just happened. Nobody really knew, but we all saw them. We never discussed it after that night and not once in the 29 years since it happened. We were all still friends. By the way, A link to that full account can be found in the show notes at monsters among us podcast.com shownotes and like Mac's entry, a lot of the mirrored men mile markers are there, but some key ones may still be missing. Either way, I suppose anytime you see three men moving in unison and strange things begin to occur in close relation, you almost have to call it a genuine Mirrored man experience. Thank you again Mac for sharing your entry. Let's hope for your sake that it wasn't the mirrored men you were dealing with.

Tonight's secret entry Takes us just down the hill from me. Literally about 14 miles is the crow flies from where my butt is currently planted, which at the very least makes this kind of special for me. So won't you join me in the excitement? This is Sherry's entry from Parts Unknown. Hi, my name is Sherry. My encounter happened when I lived in Hesperia, California. I felt prompted to call in after listening to season 15, episode 12. It was kind of comforting to know that I wasn't alone in seeing this thing, this creature that I saw. So Hesperia, for people that don't know, it's in the foothills, it's in a valley, kind of like a bowl up in the high desert. The road that I was on, it separates Oak Hills from Hesperia. It was really late at night is Ranchero Road. This happened back in 2005, 2006. So I was driving, I had a little sedan, and I don't remember where I was coming from or where I was going. And I saw this creature as I stopped at a stop sign back in 2005, 2006, there wasn't anything on that road. It was very desolate, very dark, and I only saw, like, wings and feet. And it was like it was in the middle of the road. I remember slammed on my brakes and it just blew up in front of me, just right in front of my car. It was black. I didn't see facial features. I just remember seeing the bottom of these wings and feet, and it just popped up like I surprised it. That sounds stupid, but it's almost like that's what happened. I was completely petrified. I remember turning around and going back to the way that I came. I went to Main street where there were lights, and just took the long way around to where I was going. That's all I remember doing. I don't remember anything else, but it was absolutely terrifying. Thank you for listening and thank you for the podcast. Thanks, Sherry. Ah, yeah, Esperia, a very odd city indeed, especially for the SoCal area. Sarah and I have been toying around with a move to the desert area, and Esperia was once on our short list. It's up and coming. It's just not ready for me yet. But what a great place for a creature sighting. It's nestled behind the San Bernardino Mountain Range, the range I happen to live in. It's also not too far from open desert and vast, empty stretches of land. And it's somewhat near a few different military installments, including Twentynine Palms and Edwards Air Force Base. So the conditions are right for something strange to go down there. But a big black winged beast? Truthfully, that's not what I had in mind. That's a creature better reserved for places like Point Pleasant, West Virginia or perhaps the skyscrapers in Chicago, Illinois. Not the high deserts of Southern California, not Hispia. But as odd and amazing as this report is about huge wings and feet lifting above a car, believe it or not, I actually have a more logical explanation that could explain this strange experience. Because you see, down here in the desert lives North America's largest land bird. A bird that up until recently was nearly as rare as Mothman himself. The iconic California Condor. The California Condor, once speeding towards extreme extinction, is making a comeback. We are seeing gains in the population. We are seeing condors breeding in the wild and pairing up and finding their own food and doing everything that they need to do to be successful. With a 9 and a half foot wingspan, the California Condor is the largest land bird in North America. But at one point in the 1980s worldwide there were only about two dozen of them known to be left in the wild. Now it's great to hear these living dinosaurs are making a comeback and that. Clip courtesy of KTLA News 5 out of Los Angeles. And yeah, I know this account took place back in 2005 or six and the condor wasn't as prevalent as it is today. There's an estimated 250 wild specimens remaining. But it's still just as likely that she saw one of those lift off the road in front of her as it would be a monster of some sort. But of course that's not nearly as fun. So I did a little digging in the area in hopes of finding some sort of winged cryptid that could also explain what Cherry saw. And much to my surprise, I actually came up with something. At least something adjacent. They call it the Lone Pine Mountain Devil. And it's supposed to be a large bird like or bat like reptile with two sets of wings, bright glowing eyes and razor sharp claws on each of its arms and legs. The Mountain Devil. The mountain. They really should have come up with a better moniker than that. But I guess I sort of understand because the devil is said to only eat the face and torso of its victims, leaving behind a heinous looking corpse in the process. These things, if real, seem to be pretty nasty. Now the only issue here is that these mountains devils are mostly reported. I use the term reported loosely. Up near the city of Lone Pine, California in the lower Sierra Nevada, a good two or three hours north of the location of Sherry's sighting. So is that too far for a four winged creature? Are condors returning to the high desert or was it something else altogether that Sherry saw the that evening? I will leave it up to you to decide, but we thank you Sherry for being kind enough to call in and I'll be sure to keep my eyes open next time I'm down the hill. And of course I'll let you know should I see anything. Well folks, it's that time of the evening where we cross the threshold of the paywall and dip into the after show. An after show we like to call the Beyond. It's over here that we play longer calls, we do some deep dives, we compare and contrast against previous stories, and we even feature a rebuttal from time to time.

Back in high school, me and four of my friends actually went to a Cemetery we have here in Missoula. And we decided going there for a little trip. So we went in, there's five of us. I was in the front, me, another guy and two girls. But the cemetery leads up to the highway, so we decided to jump the fence and go up to the back of the cemetery and back. And so it took. We were there about 9:30 at night. It took us maybe an hour to do. And then it was kind of spooky quiet and just had a weird feeling about being there. And so we got all the way up to the highway, it was pretty quiet. Then we did up there for a little bit, turned around, came back to the gate and my friend jumped over the fence. I helped the two girls jumped the fence and then I jumped the fence and we only had two cars. And so once I landed on the outside of the fence, I saw a six foot black snake like thing go from underneath my friend's car to underneath my car. And so I wounded up having one of my friends drive my car and we took the girls home. One of the girls was on the other side of town, so we took her home first. And then we went to the fort here in Missoula. And I was having my friend drive and we got almost to the fort and my friend slammed on the brakes and he slid and pre woke us all up. And I looked at him and I asked him, what, what the hell was he doing? And his face was like, he's seen something, I don't know, like pale white. And I asked him, what's wrong? And he told me that he just hit somebody. I looked at him like, what are you talking about? He's like, I literally just hit somebody. And so me, him and the other.",

Now, as terrifying as it might be to hit someone with your vehicle only for them to disappear into the darkness, but we've covered that plenty of times here in the program. Instead, let's focus on the strange snake that Joe saw prior to the accident. The show is called Monsters Among Us. After all, what's more monstrous than a Giant snake. But to be honest, six foot isn't very big for a snake. The largest snake found in Montana is the bull snake or the gopher snake, which can grow up to seven feet in length. I actually saved two of these beauties off local roads in the last couple of weeks while out riding my dune buggy. They can get sizable and sometimes ornery, but nothing that I would label a monster. However, giant snakes have been in the news lately. Just a few weeks ago it was announced that fossils from what is now known as the largest snake to ever slither the earth were found. They call it Vasuki indictus.",

They discovered it was a species they'd never seen before. They named it Vasuki indicus after a mythical Hindi snake king. According to the journal Scientific Reports, the snake could have been between 36 and 50ft long. Now because of its size, researchers think it was a very slow moving creature. They believe it lived around 47 million years ago. So don't go looking for one. But that's interesting. I love when they find new species or new animals that we had no idea even exist.",

Now I'm not going to play a clip from those tragic events or anything, but I will link to it in the show notes if you're interested. Morbidly curious. And believe it or not, that snake was only about 16ft long. So just imagine what the Vasuki indictus would have been capable of. But it's now long extinct and half a world away. So Joe in Montana has nothing to worry about, right? Well, not so fast, my friend. Depending on which part of Montana he's in, he could be relatively close to a body of water that's said to harbor a snake like creature that's just as large as the Vasuki indictus and it even has a cute cartoonish name.

It was in one of the houses we lived in when I was very young, I was about five years old, my parents bought this old farmhouse, this old stone farmhouse. It was a very big move for them. There's a lot of stories about this house that I can get into later, but. Or not. But the one thing specifically I wanted to talk about is because something happened in this house that I haven't heard anybody else talk about and I want to see if anybody else has had this experience. So I was about 5 years old at this point. When we lived in the house, I would be in the kitchen with my mom a lot of the time, and one wall in the kitchen facing southwest. Every once in a while this would happen where the wall would start to shimmer and glimmer to me. And I remember thinking it was so funny and laughing. My mom really didn't like this, didn't see this happening. The wall would start to move. It would separate from the wall, the shimmering square, and would move across the room towards the opposite wall. I would be sitting at the table when this happened. It happened multiple times. I remember that I would giggle and laugh. I thought it was so funny. My mom really didn't like it when it would pass through me on the other side. It like felt funny and I would laugh and it got to the point where my mom would yell at me when this would happen because I think she would get so upset she didn't like this house. She told me later a lot of things about this house really freaked her out. She told me I used to call it the shimmer wall. I don't remember saying that, but I'll.",

      "text": "Hi Derek, this is Tina from Northern California. I was listening to somebody talking about seeing a person in the middle of the road in the middle of nowhere. And that got me remembering something that happened to me when I was around 20. I was living by myself in a little apartment up there in the foothills. So like below Tahoe area. So it's kind of woodsy, it's not very dense with like neighborhoods and stuff. There's houses everywhere, but it's pretty spread out. So I went to visit a friend who lived about a mile away from me in the same little town. And I left her house around, I don't know, 11, 11:30. It was really late. And as I'm leaving her house, it's a little tiny spirit lane that goes downhill and turns and then there's this 90 degree turn to go back up towards the main road to go back to my house. But as you're coming to this 90 degree turn, there's just nothing. It's all like prairie or meadow. I guess you would say it was more of a meadow, trees way off in the distance, but there's nothing there. So as I'm driving, the only Lights are my headlights. It's totally quiet, no street lights. And I see something laying just past the 90 degree turn. You know, my eyes are trying to figure out what the heck I'm seeing. As I get closer to it, it looks like a woman is laying down with her back towards me on her side with. I remember she just had like long hair all strewn out and jeans and I don't know what kind of shirt she was wearing, but I laid there. I mean, I sat there and watched her laying there. Like, what am I seeing? This, this isn't right. And all of a sudden I just got like so scared. And I've seen a lot of stuff in my life and I have not ever really been scared. Like, things are creepy, a little perplexing, but. But this like made everything, every hair.",

There's nothing on the ground where I saw this person. And I was like, I swear to God it was there. And he just says, yes, I believe you. I totally believe you. Let's get out and look around.

      "text": "Thank you for calling in, Tina. Now, if I didn't know any better, I'd say that you had a run in with the little known but much feared beast of the Sierras known simply as Penelope. Here is what the website Weird California has to say about this monstrous maiden. Every now and then, someone sees or runs across a large, vicious, horrid humanoid creature roaming the Sierra Nevadas. Said to be a female, thin and 7ft tall, with long arms and long legs, a deformed face and long, dirty, light colored hair. This bestial creature is known as Penelope, and she is the subject of urban legend in the area. Park rangers have documented a few strange sightings over the years in the Sierra Nevada mountains, and these encounters have been attributed to this creature, who for some reason is referred to as Penelope. She has been described as wearing no clothes, looking like a beastial giant witch, and rumored to be lightning fast with razor sharp claws. She has supposedly disemboweled or even decapitated her victims before they even realize she is there. Moving so fast they have no time to react before she is upon them. Who is she? Where did she come from? No one is sure. But the short version of the urban legend describes her as a woman who became lost in the Sierra Nevadas and somehow turned into this flesh eating monster that terrorizes the region today. Well, that's spooky stuff and certainly seems similar to what Tina just described, except for one minor detail. Did you happen to catch it? That's right. It was the hair color. Tina described the hair on the entity she saw as dark brown or black. And historically, Penelope's hair, whatever the hell she might be, is often said to be blonde or light colored. I have two thoughts here. Firstly, I read several reports that also claim Penelope has dark hair as well. But those more reputable sources suggested a lighter hue. So maybe there's some sort of mix up there. But you know, I have an explanation for this little discrepancy. You see, even some light colored hair looks dark when it's wet and matted. So perhaps in the darkness, and if the mystery figure was sporting sopping wet locks, the color was incorrectly identified. Perhaps the entity's hair seemed darker because of its filthy state. Well, either way, we do appreciate the call, Tina. It's not every day I get to talk about Penelope, but trust me, whenever I'm up in the Sierra Nevadas, she's on the forefront of my mind. And speaking of discrepancies, last week I made a rare mistake and accidentally said that Crystal, who actually hails from Washington state, was from Canada. Well, I clearly got some wires crossed there, and for that I apologize. And a big thanks, I guess, to everyone that pointed out my mistake. It ain't the first and it certainly won't be the last, but we do our best to stay factual here on the show. So I wanted to clear that little mistake up. Now, moving on, I can do one more story before we have to take another break. So if you would please join me in welcoming Lily to tonight's program.",

      "text": "I love your podcast and your fan stories, and I was introduced to your podcast by my boyfriend, and my story is about aliens. So basically, this incident occurred on June 17th of 2020 and it was around 1:20 in the morning. And at the time I had shared a room with my brother and we were talking together late at night because it was summer. And I went to the bathroom and I came back and he told me he had heard a strange noise. And at first I didn't really believe him because I thought he was trying to prank me or scare me or something like that. So we were in our room together and it was probably about 20 minutes since then, and he was telling me maybe the noise would come back because he really wanted me to hear it because he couldn't believe the noise he heard. So we had continued our conversation and later on in the night, I heard the noise. And this noise still scares me till this day. And the easiest way I can explain it is that it sounded like an alien ship either landing or taking off. And the sound was very, very close. It sounded like it was maybe a few houses down from us, if that. The sound was very tacky and eerie all at the same time. And my brother and I just kind of looked at each other and we froze and we ran to our parents room and we woke up our dad and we told him the noise we heard. And he came to our room basically to try to see if he could hear this sound that we heard. And of course no sound ever came back. So in total, we only heard this sound twice. My brother heard it twice and I heard it once. And my brother and I probably stayed up till about four in the morning just to see if we can hear it again. And you know, we were discussing all the possibilities of what it could be. You know, honestly, truly, to this day, I believe it was something to do with aliens. It just. It sounded so much like a ship landing. I just can't explain it. I tried looking on YouTube of certain sounds and I can't really pinpoint an exact sound, but it does sound very, very similar to something like that. When I was researching though, that night, I found one article and it was talking about something called the hum, which claims to be a widespread low frequency humming, rumbling, or droning sound, which is not audible to all people. And this is the only thing I can possibly think of to explain this or I don't know, maybe it really was an alien ship landing. But you know, to this day I have no idea what it really was and I've not heard this sound since. And I'm just curious to know if anybody else has heard this sound because it was so close and you know, it was just very, very scary to hear this late at night. Thank you so much for listening to my story.",

Several places around the world have them. The Taos Hum in New Mexico, for example, or the Auckland Hum in New Zealand, or the Windsor Hum in Canada. This phenomenon does exist. But to me this sounds somehow much more ominous, if that makes any sense. And I have that opinion because I have another report I'm going to share in tonight's beyond episode that seems to share many, if not all of the attributes in Lilly's encounter. So be sure to stick around for that and I'll tell you how you can tune in and even do it for free at the very end of this program.

      "text": "Hi, Derek. My name is Christine. I'm calling from Washington. But my story or my experience took place in Southern California. I only think that this would be a supernatural story based off of what has happened since then. But it might be a let's not meet story because it has to do with a medium and something that they told me a few years back. So this happened in the summer of 2004. And I remember that because I turned 18 and I was working at a pool as a lifeguard. I was checking everyone in, which means I was in the front of the building. Mind you, I'm 18, I'm wearing a bathing suit and pretty much nothing else. And I'm by myself at the front. So I was very cautious of people. And as I'm checking, everyone in a family comes in that I don't recognize. And a man with long hair, dark skin, and he came up and he was kind of creepy, but I think he was just trying to be nice and I just was not comfortable. He said, I need to read you. And I was confused. Now I'm like, fine. He's like, I'm a medium. And they're telling me, I need to talk to you. And I was like, okay. And he had to be in his 30s or something, but he then followed his family and said. He said, I'm going to come back and talk to you. And I was like, no, thank you. But he left and the lines died down. Everyone was going inside. And I had about like 20 more minutes till I needed to close cash and go out. And I called my manager on the walkie talkie and I was like, hey, I got creeped out. Can I. Can I close up early? 15 minutes early? He's like, yeah, sure. Do you need me out there? And I'm like, no, it's okay. I'm just going to close out early. Just let you know. So I was closing out 15 minutes earlier, and this guy comes running back out from the showers, right? And he runs. He says, I'm glad I Caught you. I need to talk to you. And I was like, what? So I'm alone with this older man and I'm, you know, uncomfortable. I'm in a bathing suit, I'm. I'm nervous, right? And he starts telling me all these things and he starts, he's like, can I read your poem? And you know, I was, ladies, especially young girls, if you feel uncomfortable, tell them no, it's okay. And I was not in that kind of mindset. And I, I gave in. I just handed my hand over to them. And he starts reading my poem and he starts, like, rubs my arm. And I'm feeling so uncomfortable and thinking, this guy's just a creep. He's just a creep. Well, he starts saying some stuff. The first thing he says was, well, you're not a virgin. And I was like, well, that's like, of course. Like, what a creepy thing to say. Like, you're just creepy, right? And I'm like, okay. I didn't really give a confirmation. I just said, okay, move on. And then he said, okay. So it looks like you're gonna have like a nice life. Like, your lifeline is healthy. You're gonna have a good life. I see that you're gonna get married, but you're gonna get married twice. And the problem is I can't see whether it's by death or divorce, but you are gonna get married twice. And I was like, well, that doesn't give me any answers. That tells me nothing. Like, you can't tell if it's death or divorce, but you're just saying I'm going to get, like, something has to happen, right? So I just, okay, this crazy. Like, that's weird. And then he gets really somber and he says, I'm really sorry to tell you this, but you're going to have three children and one of them is going to die. And I just, my heart kind of dropped and I was like, like, what? Why are you doing this to me? You know, like, what kind of what? Like, you're such a weirdo. You're so creepy. Like, why are you doing this? And I'm thinking this man is like just here to make me uncomfortable. And he did tell me other things. He read other things on my palm, I guess, and I don't remember them because I was so upset. And like, I'm shaking now just remembering like that feeling. But he did tell me other things. I just don't remember them. So I was obviously upset because who says that to an 18 year old? Like, your kid's gonna die. And so I went to my manager and I was visibly upset and I was crying and I said, the guy came back and I told him all the things that he told me. I told him that, you know, he said, it's gonna die. And like, I was just very upset. And my manager, who is atheist and he's does not believe in anything. And he was like, you have to ignore that. Like, that guy was just a weirdo. Like, he's just. Why would anyone say that? Someone in upset. Look how upset you are. Why would someone like, like that was. We don't worry about it. He's just messing with you, essentially. Well, I kind of shake it off and I move on. And you know, years start passing and I start dating my now husband. And we've been together, we're celebrating our 15 year anniversary this year. But you know, a few years after that, I would say three to four years after that. And I'm talking with one of my friends and she's telling me, swapping like paranormal stories essentially. And I was like, yeah, I had this. I had a supernatural thing. I'd say, well, I guess, I don't know. I don't know if I believe in mediums because you might think it's not supernatural, that it's just, yeah, there's mediums in the world. And then you might see it how I see it, where I didn't believe in them. And then something happened and we're telling and I start explaining what he said to me and relaying this story again. And when me and my husband got married, he was being deployed, he was in Afghanistan. And I planned the wedding. He was gone. And he called me and said, you have to cancel, I'm not coming home. So I canceled the wedding. Luckily, he did actually come back fairly close to our original date. But I had canceled the wedding because I didn't know when he would be back. So we ended up having a courthouse wedding and it was really quick, it was just family and we just got it done because I was like, well, we already plan on getting married. I want to get married. And anyways, we did. And then the same year I was pregnant and my daughter, I became preeclamptic and I went into. She was prematurely born through via emergency C section and she did not survive. I almost didn't survive. She lived about a week in the nicu. Her body just wasn't developed enough and so we had to let her go. And so she passed and. Sorry. So anyways, I was telling my friend about that and I was explaining I was like, I. When I got a tattoo like, of my daughter's name, I put one big flower and then I put two smaller flowers. And I don't know why. I think I just aesthetically, I liked it. But I had always said, like, oh, well, we're going to redo our. Our wedding because we had to have a courthouse wedding. And now it's coming up on. We're celebrating 15 years this year. And we were just talking about how on our 20th anniversary we're going to do a renewal of our vows. And that would be a second wedding that wasn't because of death or divorce. I have two children, surviving children right now. So I had three children and one passed. It's strange because it took so many years for this all to come to pass. And I didn't believe it at first. I was wanting to shake it off as a person who just wanted to make someone uncomfortable. But now I see that it was supernatural and it was years and years coming. So I guess the point of the call is that sometimes you have these experiences and it just takes years and years for you to see it. I appreciate it. Love your show. Big fan. Thanks again. Bye.",

And a powerful premonition as well, albeit a tragic and life altering one. Now, you know, the rational side of my brain wants to write this off to coincidence. Maybe the guy just made a guess trying to impress young Christine and simply got lucky. It could happen. But that's a fairly bold thing to predict, and it certainly doesn't help him out in the flirting department. That is a mood killer right there. So that same logically thinking half of my brain tells me that if it was an attempt to woo poor Christine, it was a doomed attempt from the start. Which makes me think that it's likely that wasn't the man's intention. And that's when the imaginative side of my noggin begins churning and I start asking the tough questions. Who are they that told him he must speak with Christine? How was the information delivered? And why on earth did he feel the need to share it? Then that leads me to remember my own premonitions and how they've probably come off is creepy as well. After all, I did out several pregnancies unprovoked.

      "text": "Hi Derek, this is Ashley. I only recently found your show a few weeks ago and I'm only in season five. But I love the show and I decided to go ahead and call in with this experience. So in 2015 myself and two of my girl cousins decided to go on a girls trip to St. Augustine. We are all really interested in the paranormal so we love to do ghost tours and historical tours of the area that we visit. On this particular day in St. Augustine we rented some bikes and we were riding around and it was the evening at this time and I had decided to show them a chapel and that's located off of San Marcos Ave. Because I had an experience there and I'll call back another time about that experience. So Anyways, we ride along a side street to see this chapel called lady of Leche Chapel. It's located in a cemetery. So we're on the side street and across from the chapel are houses. So we check out the chapel, we turn around and we just happened to look up at one of the houses there. And there was a man standing in the window. He was wearing all black. He was not transparent. He was wearing a very large, wide brim hat. You can clearly see like, you know, his outline of his shoulders. But the man had no distinguishable facial features. They were all kind of blacked out. I did reach out to my cousins before recording this to make sure that what I saw was the same thing that they saw. And they did confirm the same details. So after seeing that man, obviously it scared us. So we rode away quickly on our bikes. But we did stop near the end of the street with just, you know, maybe like 20 seconds, seconds later. And we turned around to take a look at the house, but obviously there was nothing there. So the next day we revisited the area and as expected, there was nothing in the window. And located where the chapel is, there is also a church with a gift shop. And that gift shop is actually run by nuns. So we go inside to check it out. And my curiosity got the best of me and I decided to start up a convo with the nun. And I asked her, you know, if the church owns the houses across the street. And she said that they do. And I asked her if priests live there. She said that they do, the clergy lives there. And then I asked her, you know, what the priests normally wear. And she proceeded to say that, you know, on their off days they just wear regular clothes. So I asked her if in particular do they wear long black overcoat type robes with wide brim hats? And she said that they do wear robes, but they are not long black ones. And for this particular time of the year that the priests are currently wearing white robes with like purple decorations on them for the mass. But that's only during the mass. So I just thanked her for her time and we left. Never really revisited this experience or thought about it much until I started listening. But I did think to myself that even if it were a priest or a person that was in that window, what they were wearing was like very, very odd, especially for Florida, because in Florida there are only two seasons, it's either hot or hotter. And you know, it'd be weird for someone to be wearing like a long overcoat inside the house and a wide brim hat, especially in the middle of the night. It just, it didn't make sense to me. So that's really it. Thank you and keep up the good work. Derek. Love the show.",

      "text": "Thank you Ashley for the phone call. Now this is one of those types of stories that at first sounds really extraordinary, but when you think about it and break down the events, it could be easily explained. You see, it's simple. Perhaps there was a man up there, or perhaps a mannequin or dress form that was holding a costume or uniform. And maybe whatever it was was simply moved the following morning from the street view, it looked just as though there was someone or something standing up there. But in reality it was just a trick of the eye. Then again, I was not there and I do not know all that Ashley knows. So maybe there's more to this experience or perhaps it was simply something supernatural that is yet to be explained. But I love Ashley's gumption. Asking the nun working the gift shop was a great addition to the story. So thank you Ashley for both the call and for digging down deeper for the truth.

You can probably mark it under a military special if you wish. So as I'm listening to this episode, you're talking about the Mirrored man. And suddenly it triggered a memory from something, an incident that happened while I was out training one year. So this was about somewhere in the late 90s, I think. So this one night we were out training, we're driving around and it's dark. There's no lights anywhere. Of course we're under blackout condition. We stop and we huddle up with our platoon sergeant to talk about what's going to happen next. As we're standing there, there's a whole group of us, probably about 12 people. And to my left in the Woods. I hear something. And I wasn't the only one. I looked over one of my squad mates. I said, hey, you hear that? It sounds like somebody's walking over there. And like, yeah, okay, let's go check it out. So of course we do our thing. We go over and walk over toward the wood line a little bit, and I step in behind some bushes, and I swear to you, Derek, I heard three men walking towards us in the woods. I walked out a little further, and sure enough, I see three black shadows, fully dressed soldiers walking towards us. Here's what's weird. I'm not the only one who saw these three men. So I start calling out, halt. Who's there?",

Suddenly, my platoon sergeant says, hey, what's going on over there? He says, I got soldiers in front of me. They're not stopping. We're challenging them. And he walks over a little ways and he says, there's nothing there. And as soon as he said that, Derek, those shapes that I saw as three men suddenly disappeared and turned into trees, I didn't see trees. When I walked into that wood line, I saw a slightly open area with three fully dressed soldiers in black shadow outline walking towards us. My squad mates agreed there was men there because otherwise none of us would have challenged them. So I can mark this under, what did we see? Was it just trick of the light and we just thought we saw something, or was there something there that suddenly disappeared as soon as he said something? I don't know. It's a good question.

      "text": "Thank you, Mac. The mirrored men. Now, for those of you that are living under a rock, the mirrored men is a phenomena that I uncovered all the way back on the first season of this program, I shared a story my friend had been telling me since college about three men that look and move identically and that are associated with bouts of missing time. We later learned that strange weather and strange facial details also often find their way into Meerdman reports. But this is the first I've ever heard of these odd entities turning into a tree or even blending into their surroundings, and there didn't seem to be any mention of missing time or odd or inclement weather as well. And their appearance as soldiers is certainly brand new to me. So you decide for yourself. Was this a true Mirrored man experience or something that somehow just seems similar now? Since we're talking about the infamous Mirrored Man, I thought this would be a great opportunity to share a story I found recently on a website I frequent called Phantoms and Monsters, a collection of written accounts from researcher Lon Strickler. This story was originally obtained by our friends at Expanded Perspectives. I grew up in a small town and this particular thing happened in an even smaller town. I was 16. My best friend and I worked at a fast food restaurant. Our boyfriends normally picked us up from work and if it was early enough or the weekend, we usually went to one of our homes. If not, he'd drop me off at home. My mom was very lenient so I didn't have to tell her what I was doing. She knew who I was with and knew I'd be home. Now this night happened to be Halloween and instead of the usual, somebody had the idea to ride around before we had to be home. It was around 8pm There was an old long closed cement plant in the smaller town and from the sounds of sounded pretty creepy. I had only heard of it before and that night found myself on my way there. I wasn't afraid, just going with the flow and having fun with my friends. It was myself, my best friend, another girl and her two boyfriends in the car. The old plant used to be a thriving, active business, built in the early 1900s but had long closed down. It was situated along the outskirts of town along a very long two lane dark road with no street lights. It was well past any residential area. We drove out to the plant which took about 15 minutes. My boyfriend was driving, I was in the front passenger seat and the other three were in the back. We pulled up to the plant which was on our left, but my boyfriend did a U turn and parked along the fence so the plant is now on our right. We were all talking, just saying how old the place was and what it must have been like to see it in its earlier days. There were machine parts and metal and other debris all over the large lot. Even in the dark you could make out the junk. We hadn't been there maybe five minutes when the two guys decided to get out and get closer to the fence for a more dramatic experience. It truly wasn't scary, but the other guys were making noises trying to scare us girls. We all started laughing but immediately stopped. Out of nowhere lights came on in the doorways windows of the abandoned building. It was as if somebody turned on a light switch that lit up 20 or 30 windows at the same time. In the lights were standing these huge buff, tall, idle standing men that had long hair. They didn't walk up to the light, they were already in the light. They didn't appear to be standing behind the structures of the building on the inside, but on the outside of the building as if on a balcony or ledge. All the men were uniform, all the same size and stature, not saying a word, not moving. They had balled up fists and seemed to have work boots on. I didn't notice any wind blowing before, but you could see their long hair blowing softly in the wind, all in unison. You could see their huge arm muscles, but strangely these things were featureless. You could assume that they were men, but their bodies were like shadows, blacker than black. You could not make out any facial features or clothing. Nothing. They just stood there, perfectly still. I don't know how long before my friend broke the silence with her scream, but we were mesmerized. We were only staring for a few seconds, but it felt like 100 minutes. She screamed and the two boys ran back to the car. We flew out of the dirt packed area by the fence, along the road and back onto the pavement and rode completely in silence. My boyfriend was the first to ask what had just happened. Nobody really knew, but we all saw them. We never discussed it after that night and not once in the 29 years since it happened. We were all still friends. By the way, A link to that full account can be found in the show notes at monsters among us podcast.com shownotes and like Mac's entry, a lot of the mirrored men mile markers are there, but some key ones may still be missing. Either way, I suppose anytime you see three men moving in unison and strange things begin to occur in close relation, you almost have to call it a genuine Mirrored man experience. Thank you again Mac for sharing your entry. Let's hope for your sake that it wasn't the mirrored men you were dealing with.

It was kind of comforting to know that I wasn't alone in seeing this thing, this creature that I saw. So Hesperia, for people that don't know, it's in the foothills, it's in a valley, kind of like a bowl up in the high desert. The road that I was on, it separates Oak Hills from Hesperia. It was really late at night is Ranchero Road. This happened back in 2005, 2006. So I was driving, I had a little sedan, and I don't remember where I was coming from or where I was going. And I saw this creature as I stopped at a stop sign back in 2005, 2006, there wasn't anything on that road. It was very desolate, very dark, and I only saw, like, wings and feet. And it was like it was in the middle of the road. I remember slammed on my brakes and it just blew up in front of me, just right in front of my car. It was black. I didn't see facial features. I just remember seeing the bottom of these wings and feet, and it just popped up like I surprised it. That sounds stupid, but it's almost like that's what happened. I was completely petrified. I remember turning around and going back to the way that I came. I went to Main street where there were lights, and just took the long way around to where I was going. That's all I remember doing. I don't remember anything else, but it was absolutely terrifying. Thank you for listening and thank you for the podcast.",

Sarah and I have been toying around with a move to the desert area, and Esperia was once on our short list. It's up and coming. It's just not ready for me yet. But what a great place for a creature sighting. It's nestled behind the San Bernardino Mountain Range, the range I happen to live in. It's also not too far from open desert and vast, empty stretches of land. And it's somewhat near a few different military installments, including Twentynine Palms and Edwards Air Force Base. So the conditions are right for something strange to go down there. But a big black winged beast? Truthfully, that's not what I had in mind. That's a creature better reserved for places like Point Pleasant, West Virginia or perhaps the skyscrapers in Chicago, Illinois. Not the high deserts of Southern California, not Hispia. But as odd and amazing as this report is about huge wings and feet lifting above a car, believe it or not, I actually have a more logical explanation that could explain this strange experience. Because you see, down here in the desert lives North America's largest land bird. A bird that up until recently was nearly as rare as Mothman himself. The iconic California Condor.",

And yeah, I know this account took place back in 2005 or six and the condor wasn't as prevalent as it is today. There's an estimated 250 wild specimens remaining. But it's still just as likely that she saw one of those lift off the road in front of her as it would be a monster of some sort. But of course that's not nearly as fun. So I did a little digging in the area in hopes of finding some sort of winged cryptid that could also explain what Cherry saw. And much to my surprise, I actually came up with something. At least something adjacent. They call it the Lone Pine Mountain Devil. And it's supposed to be a large bird like or bat like reptile with two sets of wings, bright glowing eyes and razor sharp claws on each of its arms and legs. The Mountain Devil. The mountain. They really should have come up with a better moniker than that. But I guess I sort of understand because the devil is said to only eat the face and torso of its victims, leaving behind a heinous looking corpse in the process. These things, if real, seem to be pretty nasty. Now the only issue here is that these mountains devils are mostly reported. I use the term reported loosely. Up near the city of Lone Pine, California in the lower Sierra Nevada, a good two or three hours north of the location of Sherry's sighting. So is that too far for a four winged creature? Are condors returning to the high desert or was it something else altogether that Sherry saw the that evening? I will leave it up to you to decide, but we thank you Sherry for being kind enough to call in and I'll be sure to keep my eyes open next time I'm down the hill. And of course I'll let you know should I see anything. Well folks, it's that time of the evening where we cross the threshold of the paywall and dip into the after show. An after show we like to call the Beyond. It's over here that we play longer calls, we do some deep dives, we compare and contrast against previous stories, and we even feature a rebuttal from time to time.
