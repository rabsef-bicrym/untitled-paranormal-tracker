12: [Speaker A] Good evening and welcome to Monsters Among Us. I am your guide, Derek Hayes. Hello everyone and welcome back to another installment. You're gonna be glad you tuned in this evening because I have a really good one lined up for you here tonight. And as I teased last week, a possible mirrored men call that'll send shivers down your spine. And this time, we get to lay eyes on this troublesome trio. But first, I have all kinds of strangeness to share with you here tonight. So let's get started by venturing to the Empire State. Please welcome Magnus from New York to tonight's program.
13: [Speaker B] Hey there Derek. The name's Magnus. I'm from the Fringer Lakes region of Western New York where spiritualism, Fox sisters and all of fun religions and cults have started enough so we call it the Burned Over District. So I'm used to being in an area that has otherworldly and paranormal sort of vibes. I am actually Calling because I listened to episode 43 in season 18. One of the guys was talking about seeing something kind of moving on rails down a hallway in a kind of repetitive fashion. And I have a story that. That I've been meaning to call. And after listening to this, it really kind of made me realize I should. So this starts with me being a little kid, one of my best friends. We were three days apart and we lived only a couple miles apart from each other out in the country. So we have pictures of us being newborns together. That's how long we were friends. And I would go over to his house and hang out. And just as kids do, long story relatively short. Unfortunately, he lost his father. He was an electrician and died at work. His mom remarried and they moved away. And in that time, my cousin and her husband bought their house and lived there. They still have that house. Now, I had been in that house from the time I was a child, so it was kind of interesting to be in that house as an adult. Then they were traveling for a week. They were taking a family trip or something else, and they needed someone to house sit as well as watch their dog. Now, during this whole time, they actually would chuckle that the house was haunted and things would like move and fall. And I actually witnessed a couple times things weirdly moving that didn't just fall off a table, they kind of flung off a table. So there always was kind of a joke about the house being haunted. And one of the things that they would say was that if you're sitting on the couch, there's a mirror on the one wall in the living room watching television. And in the mirror you can see down the hallway towards kind of the back door. And routinely they would see someone would walk in the back door any time of night, and they would go and check. And, you know, even a dog would run over there, check. There would be no one there. So I was told this by my cousin multiple times to keep an eye out for something that way. So as I'm sitting there kind of late at night, probably after midnight, dogs on my feet were watching television. And sure enough, down in that mirror, I catch something. Walk in the back door. The back door is locked. This isn't a country home. There is no one around. There's miles of empty farmland around this house. But clearly someone walked in the door. And I actually sent the dog over to check out, and dog walked over and no one was there. So I sat back down and probably 30 minutes maybe or so goes by, and I think I see Something again, moving the door. It goes in. The door quickly turns right. I feel like something's walking in. So I sat and watched and waited, and nothing. And again, I kind of said hello, I think. And as I'm sitting there, I kind of just go back to watching the television straight ahead. And the back door immediately to the right, which the thing had walked into, was a bathroom. And that bathroom has a second door, which is in the hallway, which is now my peripheral vision, my right eye. Imagine going 90 degrees. The hallway goes out. So the back of the couch is right against that wall. That would be the hallway down that way. So in my peripheral vision, as I'm watching television, I see what looks like something go out of the bathroom, down the hallway into the master bedroom on that same side, as fast as I can turn my head. Something moved through there. But the crazy thing was I wasn't scared by it. I wasn't like. But the feeling that hit me instantly, what hit me was a feeling of familiarity to it. And that's what caught me off guard more than anything else. That something moving down that hallway. This quick motion, this whole thing I'm seeing felt way more familiar than any sort of ominous, scary, possible shadowy figure running down a hallway. And it wasn't like it was a human form. It was just something moving. I felt like the person that walked in the door kind of was the same sort of vibe of a person walking in with the person moving down that hallway. And I sat there for a second, and I couldn't quite understand why I was having a feeling of familiarity until it fully hit me like a bolt out of the blue that I'd seen this before. I'd seen this a lot before, is that when my friend's father would come home from work, he was an electrician. He was always covered with dust and dirt. His wife would make him go in the back door and then go right into the bathroom, get unchanged, take a shower, get himself all cleaned up. And then I would see him, being a little kid, just. He would run down the hallway as quick as he could to go get changed, to come back and hang out with us and play with us. And I realized this thing I had seen move repetitively in the same sort of, like, action, like moving down a rail system, just repetitive action was something that was familiar to me. And it was exactly the actions I would see from my friend's father when I was a kid. And it makes me feel good to just get home and wants to come out and hang out with us again. I feel like. But thanks so much for all you do. I really dig this show. Keep up the great work and thanks so much.
14: [Speaker A] Thank you Magnus. Amazing. And even more amazing that you made that connection. I often say that if you're going to host a ghost, it might as well be family and the story is a perfect example of that mantra. Now, before I move on, I wonder if Magnus told his friend what he saw and of the connection that he made. And if so, what does the friend think about the ghost of his father frequenting the home? Like I said, amazing stuff, Magnus. And thank you again for sharing it. Now folks, I have so many more spooky stories to share with you here tonight, but first we need to take a quick commercial break. I'll be right back. Like when they do Power Rankings Pros.

18: [Speaker F] Thinking it about them and their agenda.
19: [Speaker B] Wow.
20: [Speaker F] That's. That's a dark.
21: [Speaker A] All right, it's time for a UFO story. And not just any ufo. A classic silver craft. Please welcome Colleen out of Missouri.
22: [Speaker G] Hi Derek and friends. My name is Colleen. I am calling from the Show Me State. I live in Independence, Missouri. I was on my way home back from work around 5:53pm on Friday, September 26th. I was wearing sunglasses and I was looking up at the sky through them my windshield. There's no tint on my windshield and I saw a silvery thing in the air, like flying. And I thought it might be a helicopter or some kind of airplane because there's a lot of airplanes around here. And then I took my sunglasses off to look at it again and it was still there. And then I sat back and was thinking, huh, wouldn't that be cool if it just disappeared or took off? And then I looked back up and it was gone. That was less than 2 seconds or so. And if it was a helicopter or airplane, it wouldn't have gone too far from the area. So maybe it was just one of those things where the plane turned away and the sun would stop shining on it. I'm not sure, but it just happened to me. I was so excited to call, but I decided to wait and pull over. But that's my story. Thank you.
23: [Speaker A] Thank you Colleen for ringing in. Now here's something weird. Typically when we share a UFO call like this, we do our best to cross reference it with any other known encounters from that time and place. And Colleen's call was no exception. Now the weird part isn't what we found, it's what we didn't find. Not only are there no other UFO reports made from Independence, Missouri this past September, but there hasn't been a report made since all the way back in August of last year. I find that a bit surprising coming from a town of 123,000. What does that mean? I don't have a clue. Perhaps people in that area are simply tight lipped. Or maybe the folks there just don't look up. Perhaps there's a no fly zone for UFOs in the area. Whatever the reason, it's odd that there are so few reports. But we sure are glad that you shared your experience here with us Colleen. Perhaps your story will help open the floodgates. And folks, if you too have a story you would like to share, give our Hotline a call at 8886. That's 888-608-NIG HT. Or you can record your story as a voice memo and email it to me at monsters among us podcastmail.com now don't forget to call in from a quiet place. One story per call, one call per story. Unless you need more time to finish. In that case, just call back and pick up where you left off. Now There is a 5 minute time limit per message. And lastly, true stories only. Save your yarns for another occasion. And if you have young ones that are into the paranormal, why not introduce them to Monsters Among Us Junior A Kids version of the show. New episodes drop every other Wednesday yesterday for those listening to this when it released. And if your youngster has a story they'd like to share, have them call our hotline at 833 Maukids or shoot us an email at monsters among us jrmail.com regardless of how you reach out, we can't wait to hear from you. Now back to the stories and back to the east coast. Please welcome Rachel from the state of Virginia.
24: [Speaker G] Hi Derek, this is Rachel calling. I'm from Virginia and I wanted to call in and share my story regarding mimics. I never really knew what mimics were, but when I grew up and started listening to stories and things like that, I realized that I may have had my own encounter with a mimic as a child. And this mimic would be something mimicking my mother. And the first experience I had with this was I was about four or five years old and I had woken up and I looked in my doorway and I saw my mom standing there, what looked like my mom, but she had a very bizarre, like evil looking smile on her face and she was holding a butcher knife. And I was really confused as a kid because I didn't really understand because I'm like, this is my mom. So I kind of just like looked away and then when I looked back, it wasn't there. And then I just went back to sleep and I asked her about it the next morning and she had no clue what I was talking about. And she just told me it was a nightmare. And, you know, I chalked it up to it being a nightmare. So When I was 16, I was dating this guy at the time and he lived with us. And he went into the kitchen to get something to eat and he came all of a sudden, like rushing down the hallway, like back into my room. And like, he looked truly petrified. And when I asked him what was wrong, he's like, I don't want to talk about it. And like, that guy definitely did not get easily scared. And finally when he told me, he said that he was making a bowl of cereal. And when he turned and looked, there was my mom standing there, but she was like hunched over and she just looked like really like evil. And then he like turned away and turned back and it was gone. And then we asked my mom about it. She had again, no clue what we were talking about. And then the last encounter that I experienced was when I got home one night. I walked through the door, we had like this little foyer area. And then there was a set of stairs that went up and then down. And when you looked up, you saw our kitchen. And I remember clear as day seeing my mom standing in the kitchen putting silverware away. So I turn, take off my shoes, start walking upstairs, and all of a sudden I see her sitting all the way in the back dining room. And they're like a pretty good room apart. Like, there's literally no way that she could have made her way from the kitchen all the way to the back dining room. By the time I walked up a few steps, I asked her, I was so confused. I was like, how did you get in there so fast? And she's like, what are you talking about? And I was like, you were just standing here putting silverware away. And she's like, no, I've been sitting here the whole time. And that was the last kind of encounter that I had with it. But anytime I think about this, I get instant chills and it really freaks me out just to have like multiple experiences. And it all being like, my mom in the same kind of like creepy version of her has definitely always kind of freaked me out. But that was in our old house. And I've never experienced anything since moving out of that house. So I don't know, just weird coincidences or not. But it's definitely something that has freaked me out. And I don't know if it could be a possible mimic, but hopefully I never have to encounter seeing my mother's so called mimic again because it was scary. But thanks for everything you do. I love the show and can't wait to continue to hear the new episode. Thanks.
25: [Speaker A] Thank you, Rachel. Perhaps one of the freakiest phenomena, Paranormal mimicry. It's probably freaky because these mimics always seem to replicate close family members. In this case, Rachel's mother. And what makes them even freakier is the fact that oftentimes these mimics seem to be beckoning people into the forest or into the darkness. Now, I wish I had more information to share about this particular type of activity, but frankly, I don't know that there is a lot to share. It's unnerving, unsettling, and very much unexplained. But we thank you, Rachel, for sharing another data point and for making the phone call. All right, gang, real quick, let's sneak in one more call before our next break. So please welcome anonymous out of the state of Indiana.
26: [Speaker F] Hello. I like to remain anonymous. I live in Indiana. So this is kind of like a two part story. What happened was that me and my wife were taking a ghost tour In Indiana, near the Culberson mansion. And one of the stories is that a local police officer got a call about the alarm inside the Culberson mansion that kept going off. So he went inside, checked it out, and he saw a woman in black just walking. He was thinking it was one of the actors from the Culberson mansion, like, doing, like, the history tour or something like that. Then he talked to the manager and he asked, what? Hey, is one of your workers still here? And the manager goes, woodworker, woman was dressed up in black. And he goes, oh, you seen the Woman in black? Mrs. Culberson herself. The other part of the story is that I was out with some friends around that area, and I was like, you know what? I'm gonna drive past the Culberson mansion just to see if I, you know, see anything. Well, I drove past, parked for about. Not even for like a minute. All the lights were out except for one, and there was a black silhouette just staring down. I couldn't even see it. The blinds were in front. But I just have this eerie feeling that it was her. It was a very scary moment. Heck, I have goosebumps just by talking about it as well. And. Yeah, that's all.
27: [Speaker A] Thank you, caller. I'd never heard of this place, the Culbertson mansion. So we did a little digging. The Culbertson mansion was built in 1867 by William Culbertson, who was an industrialist, philanthropist, and at the time, the wealthiest man in the state of Indiana. The sprawling 20,000 square foot abode boasted 25 rooms and cost a total of $120,000 when it was built. Now that's roughly $2 million today. According to legend, the carriage house burned down in 1888, killing all those who were inside. After changing owners multiple times, the Culbertson mansion fell into disarray in the 1960s and earned the reputation of being haunted. When the space was turned into a local history center in the 1970s, visitors began to report all kinds of odd activity.
28: [Speaker H] The staff has been keeping a file here since 1977 of different things that happened that they can't explain.
29: [Speaker C] Some visitors have seen puffs of cigar smoke with no source.
30: [Speaker E] Others, disturbances gone unexplained from electricity to.
31: [Speaker H] Sounds to, you know, there have even been reports of seeing people that Aren't there many here?
32: [Speaker C] Not sure what to believe.
33: [Speaker H] I have seen things I cannot explain.
34: [Speaker E] Whether you're here for the history or.
35: [Speaker C] Culbertson's haunted past, the mansion here has.
36: [Speaker A] A way of drawing people in that. Clip courtesy of WAVE NBC News 3 out of Louisville, Kentucky. And from what I understand, the Culbertson Mansion embraces their haunted history. They give ghost tours of the mansion and every year they do a haunted house in the barn out back. All proceeds go toward restorations on the building. So if you find yourself in Southern Indiana just outside of Louisville, Kentucky, swing by and take a tour. Better yet, visit their haunted house next fall. But good luck distinguishing ghosts from haunt actors now. Big thanks caller for turning me on to the Culbertson Mansion. Like I said, somehow it wasn't on my radar.

41: [Speaker B] Yes, but can't decide better. There's no debate really.
42: [Speaker A] Now for this next entry, we work our way a bit south. Please welcome Angela from Tennessee.
43: [Speaker C] Hey Derek, this is Angela calling from Tennessee on my way to work back around in August of 1990 on the Cumberland Gap Parkway between Barbourville, Kentucky and Corbin. Today that's a four lane highway, but who knows what it may have been in years past in pioneer days, but because I live near actually the Cumberland Gap, supposedly where Daniel Boone led the people westward. Anyway, I'm on my way to work really early. I'm a nurse at that time heading to work in my 7am shift. It was dark at that time. I had probably about an hour, a little over an hour drive. So I'm driving along doing around 55 mile an hour, careful not to speed or get a ticket or anything. I'm traveling northbound US 25E and on the other side there is a southbound 25E, so you get the picture. And there's a grassy median in between these two highways. And suddenly in my headlights I noticed someone up ahead on the highway. And I see this woman, she's crossing from the passenger side over towards, I guess the driver's side that way.
44: [Speaker G] And she wasn't lit up or anything.
45: [Speaker C] But I want to tell you right now that I have thought about this many times since those in years past. And it doesn't make sense that I saw all the detail that I did. But I did, I did see it. I don't know if she wanted me to see, but here's what I saw. There was a lady, never did turn around to look at me, but she had on a bonnet, she had on a long flowing skirt. I did not see any feet. She had on like a long sleeve jacket that ended at her waist. If you could picture a Laura Ingalls Little House on the Prairie type person, except she was a lady, a grown woman, you know, probably my height, 5 6, 5 7. As I'm traveling towards her, you know, I'm just mesmerized because it's 1990, it's in August, and it's around 6 o' clock in the morning. And plus I'm barreling towards her at 55 mile an hour. And I saw all this detail. I'll never forget it. I don't know what it was. It looked human. I did not see any feet. And I know what you're thinking, well, how did you see this? I've asked myself that many times before. I don't know, it's almost as if time slowed down. Does that make sense? I. I don't know. It's like there she was and she crossed and she made it across the road before I reached her. And I looked back and it's like when I passed her, she was just like a. I don't know, you could see through her. But like I said, I was passing her, you know, really fast. But when I looked in my rearview mirror, I couldn't see anything. Now I had never forgotten that. I've only told a couple of people. I know it sounds crazy, how could I have seen this lady? I mean, how could I have? But I did. I don't know if that kind of, you know how I've heard of Resurrection Mary, like she glows. This lady didn't Glow. But she wanted me to see her and I saw her. I saw all that detail. I don't know if maybe the area we live in, you know, at one time, maybe she may have been a pioneer, I don't know. I've always wanted to research that area and see if there was any record of anything happening when times passed. But, you know, this area, there's always probably something happening. I'm not sure who she was or what she was, but I'm sorry. And I love the podcast. I listen every week. Keep up the good work. Anyway, bye bye.
46: [Speaker A] We appreciate the entry, Angela. And coincidentally, my wife's grandmother lives right there in that area just outside of Barberville, about five miles from where this sighting occurred, give or take. So with that kind of inside knowledge available to us, Sarah reached out to her meemaw and asked her if she knew of any other similar ghost stories from that part of Kentucky. Well, sadly, she had nothing to offer other than to say that her father was a miner in that area and he claimed to hear footsteps in empty mines all the time. So was there a connection there? Probably not, but I thought that was too cool. Not to mention. And speaking of cool, your story was exactly that, Angela. If you do get around to doing some research, by all means, keep us updated. I would love to get to the bottom of this, but until then, thank you again for making the phone. Alrighty then, meet me in Texas for this next one. David, welcome to the show.
47: [Speaker I] Hey, Derek, this is David in Wilson Brook, Texas. When I was a little boy, we used to go up to Oklahoma, visit my half brother and my half sister and all that. And one night we were there going to like a fairground. There's like in winter of, I would say 80 or 81, five or six years old. Really young, but it's such a vivid memory. And we're walking across the field, it's at night towards the field grounds. You can see all their Ferris wheels, all that stuff. And as I'm walking with my family across the field after we get out of the truck, I look to the left and into the sky because something got my notice. There was a giant, for lack of a better word, it was a giant egg. It was like an egg shaped craft hovering there. It was very luminous. It didn't have lights around it, but it looked more like the lights were coming from within it. But there was no windows, no windows at all. Just an egg. A damn egg. It wasn't the moon and it wasn't no blimp or nothing like that. I remember looking at the thing and what's weird is that I remember looking at it, but I don't remember looking away from it to continue walking with my family. Because one second I'm looking at it, next second I'm still walking with my family to the fairground. And there's like a little blank space of time right in between me looking at it and that the memory didn't come back to me until like a few days later. And all of the mimics flashback me like. And even at that young age I remember, oh my God, what did I see, you know, that night? And the memory still stuck with me. But I, for life of me, for life of me cannot remember what happened in that gap when I looked at it. And then I continued to walk with my family, you know, to the fairgrounds. I had no memory of the missing space. And I asked my mom, my dad and all that if they had seen it, you know, over the years. I asked them periodically and no, my ancestor didn't see it either. And so it was just one of those weird occurrences that as I got older I started studying more about UFOs. I found out that it's called mission time effect. And what's that? What I had, I don't know, even the egg shaped craft back then I thought I was the only one that seen something like that, but I don't know, there's actually quite common, especially nowadays. I hear a lot of sightings of HV craft. There's even a CNA who works at Exploration I met when she was 16. She saw an HV craft out in the country here in Texas, and it looked the same thing. That might look like it was a luminous egg shaped craft, but she didn't have the mission time effect like I did. But yeah, you do a great job. Great, great, awesome job. I love the podcast. Goodbye.
48: [Speaker A] Thank you, David. Now, not only is the egg shape common, it's also famous. There have been a few high profile flaps involving just such a craft. On April 24, 1964, there were two separate run ins. One in Socuro, New Mexico involving a police officer and another in Newark Valley, New York where a dairy farmer witnessed something awfully similar. Then again in 1965 in Valensol, France, when on July 1st of that year, a farmer saw an egg shaped object in a field and two small humanoids exited the vehicle. And then again in 1993, two officers in a police helicopter encountered an egg shaped object a mile in the air.
49: [Speaker B] Shortly before midnight last Friday night, officers Kenny Graham and Kenny Downs were aboard this Jefferson county police helicopter. They were flying over the site of a suspected break in near Sanford Avenue and Buchelbank Road when they encountered something very strange.
50: [Speaker A] It appeared to be some type of egg, a pear shaped object with a glow inside.
51: [Speaker B] The officers were flying a Jefferson county police helicopter at the scene of a suspected break in near Buchel Bank Road when they saw that egg, pear shaped object.
52: [Speaker A] When the light at that time appeared on it, it just started floating towards a helicopter.
53: [Speaker B] The ufo, about the size of a basketball, began making loops while the officers did their best to keep them within sight, but not too close as both chopper and whatever traveled at around 100 miles an hour. I know it was traveling at speeds I'd never seen before. And suddenly the UFO turned on its pursuer.
54: [Speaker A] They shot three fireballs out and just the lights went out and they come at us and he turned the helicopter and it was gone.
55: [Speaker B] The officers still don't know what it was they saw or what happened to it. But today, GE employee Dwayne Hitchler was called in to fill a mysterious hole near where the encounter took place.
56: [Speaker A] There was no apparent reason for it to be there.
57: [Speaker B] Dwayne says the mysterious hole was just about the size of a basketball, just like the ufo.
58: [Speaker A] I believe that it was maybe an egg or something that was in the.
59: [Speaker C] Ground that hatched, you know, and, and.
60: [Speaker A] Just came up out of the ground and took off. Now that clip courtesy of WLKY CBS News 32 out of Louisville, which is where this event took place. And if I'm understanding their claims correctly, it seems like they're suggesting that whatever these things are, they might not come from outer space. According to at least one of these gentlemen, they might come from under the ground. So, David, take solace in knowing that you're not the only one to have encountered such a craft. And there is a bright side here. At least the craft you saw didn't shoot fireballs at you. Thank you again, David, for taking the time to share this wild tale.

65: [Speaker A] Now. This next entry takes us to Colorado. Please welcome Kathy to tonight's show.
66: [Speaker D] Hi, my name is Kathy. I'm calling from Colorado. My daughter is a big fan of your show and she turned me onto it and wants me to tell my story. This happened July 29, 1981, during the wedding of Prince Charles and Princess Diana. My mother and I were in the front room watching tv. My back was facing the kitchen where my mom was sitting. If she looked to her left, she could see the kitchen. All of a sudden it sounded like someone was in the kitchen, opening and slamming the cupboard doors and the drawers and throwing silverware all over the place and very loud, very scary. I looked at my mom and she turned her head and looked into the kitchen for about two or three seconds. Then she looked back at me and her eyes were like really big. And she shook her head no, as if to say, don't turn around. Just sit there and wait. So about 20 to 25 seconds later, it stopped. We then both got up, went into the kitchen. There was silverware everywhere, on the floor, on the counters. The cupboard doors were still open, the drawers were still open, and we were just looking at each other like, what the heck happened? So we just cleaned up the kitchen and went back down and sat down and watched TV as if nothing happened. We never talked about it after that. I'm from California, born and raised, 43 years. I know what an earthquake feels like. It definitely was not an earthquake. I have researched earthquakes on July 29, 1981, in or around the Bay Area and could not find anything. So to this day we don't know what it was. But it was very, very scary. And she never did tell me what she saw that day that she looked into the kitchen. So I don't know what she saw and well, thank you for letting me share my story. Have a good one.
67: [Speaker A] Thank you Kathy for calling in any big thanks to your daughter for sharing the program with you. Like something out of a movie. Very cliche of your ghosts, Kathy, but I guess you stick with what works. But you know, this doesn't sound like something that would be caused by an earthquake to me, because if there was an earthquake big enough to move your entire kitchen around, I guarantee you would have felt it in the living room. But I also think it's odd that this was a one off. How weird that this event only occurred once. Super interesting, whatever it was. Kathy, we thank you again for sharing.

A call that you all have no doubt been waiting for. Buckle up folks. The following anonymous caller from Washington is about to take us on a wild ride.
68: [Speaker H] Hi Derek, I am going to stay anonymous for this call, but I'm calling in regards to an event that happened on September 26, 2024 and it began at 11:38am I in Western Washington and I was hiking on this trail called the Yellow Aster Butte Trail in the Mount Baker Wilderness and I was on my way to Summit Tommy Hoy Peak. I started on this trail because the Yellow Aster Butte it splits off on two Tommy Hoy Peak Trail. So I was still on the Yellow Aster Butte and it was kind of a rainy overcast day and on my way into the trail I saw one man on his way out. We said hi and I kept on going and there was nobody out there. I've been on this trail one time before, but it was even more cloudy and overcast and foggy the first time, so it felt like a new Trailer. And about a mile, a mile and a half in. It's not above tree line, but the trees clear out a little bit. And it's kind of like this counterclockwise C shape that you end up hiking around this valley. And you get a clear shot right across the valley. And it's so beautiful. But I'd gotten above treeline, and as I was hiking, I was kind of having this. A bit of a fantasy as a solo hiker, not listening to music, I just let my imagination run. And I was thinking about how neat it would be if my sister were out here with me. Because my sister and I, we don't talk anymore, and I was just kind of missing her. And then I was thinking about how neat it would be if we were walking along and all of a sudden an alien appeared in front of us. And the alien tells us, you know, you're one of us and you get to come home with us, with me. And I was thinking about how much of a relief that would be of, like, okay, all right. Like, something had to be up. So I was just kind of enjoying that fantasy a little bit. And then all of a sudden, to my left in the air, and if I look to the left, I can see across the valley to the other side where the trail meets. I heard a turkey gobble. Like the most classic silly turkey gobble up in the air. And I look up into the sky and I see two turkey vultures. And in the moment, I didn't put it together, that that is a ridiculous thing to happen. That's normal. So I'm looking at the turkey vultures, and I'm like, oh, cool.
69: [Speaker A] Neat.
70: [Speaker H] And then as my gaze kind of cuts across the valley, as I'm bringing my head back forward, I see a flash of. Of brilliant white. So then I snap back and I'm looking over to my left, and I see these two white kind of pillars a little bit, and they're so small, and they're across the way and they're not moving. And I stop and I'm looking at them, and I'm kind of like moving back and forth a little bit to try to gauge. Like, are they moving? Like, what am I looking at? My first thought was mountain goats. Like, maybe they're up on their hind legs, but these would have to be, like 8 foot tall mountain goats. Like, these were very tall. Just, like, by comparison of how high they were reaching the trees behind them. And they're still not moving. So I'm thinking maybe rocks, but I don't Remember walking past rocks on my first time through there? Like, tall, white, like marble rocks, I guess. So I wave at it, and I know that I can be seen across the way because one, if I'm seeing them, they can see me. But I'm also wearing hi vis orange pants because I was about to go on a solo climb. You know, I want to be found if things go south. So I know that they saw me because when I waved at them, they started moving. I end up getting my phone out and I start recording it because I had it zoomed in all the way, and it was a little bit clearer to see. And, God, I would kill to go back in time and have binoculars, but whatever. So I'm looking at them, and the one on the right ends up splitting into two of its own. So now I'm looking at three white pillars. And when I first started recording, the one on the right was kind of like hunched over a little bit, kind of like an upside down L shape, but it's. It's moving, and I'm just so fascinated by it. And later on, I recorded myself talking about what. What I had seen. And I mentioned that I had been recording them for 15 minutes, and in no way was that 15 minutes. I have maybe like a minute and a half of video of them. So I don't know why it felt like I was there for so long. But the one on the far right eventually turned into a hovering ball. Like, the legs just kind of got sucked up, and it's just a floating ball. And I don't know what came over me that ended up prioritizing. I need to keep going because I'm running out of daylight and I need to reach the summit. I can't just sit here and watch these things all day like an idiot. So I keep on hiking, and occasionally I look over to my left and I still see them there. And I'm going, I'm going. I look over to my left one more time, look ahead, look to my left again, and they're gone. And I stop again because it's a very clear area. Like, if they had started to meander off into a certain direction, I would have seen them. Especially with, you know, how little time had passed from glancing over, looking forward, glancing over again, and they're gone. So that freaked me out a little bit. And the first time I'd been on this trail, there was just no cell service out there. But Now I had 5G. I had bars, like, enough to call my partner and send him a photo of what I was looking at, and we're both just kind of stumped. Like, didn't really know what I had seen. And then I get to the part of the trail where they had been standing, and the ground is, like this silty, almost mud kind of texture. And I can see the footprints going in and out of them, man, that I'd seen earlier, but that was it. Only one set of footprints. So odd. But I keep going. And there's something in my head that's like, it's probably three people. Like, likely three people. You know, I. From filming from so far away, like, there could have been a distortion in the camera. It was an overcast day. But from far away, maybe just light reflecting made them look white. Like, I'm so frustrated because I feel like I have just enough information to argue both sides of this. Like, this could be people, or it could have been something that I've never seen before. Anyway, I keep on hiking. I get to the junction where I split off from Yellow aster Butte, and now I'm on the Tommy Hoy trail. And I see this couple, they're coming up the way that, like, they're coming towards me, and I end up stopping them. And I was like, hey, have you seen, like, any groups of people out today? And they're like, no, haven't seen anyone. It's dog weather. And I was like, okay, maybe like, two people, like, one person wearing, like, all white. And they're like, no, dude. And I end up showing them the video. And it's so funny. Like, in the very beginning, when they're not moving, the girl, she's looking at it. She's like, those are rocks. And I was like, yeah, hold on, Just wait. And then she sees a move, and she's like, oh, yeah, I don't know. I haven't seen that. I was like, okay, yeah, no problem. But I end up getting just shy of the summit of Tommy Hoy. I'm running out of daylight. It's getting extremely windy. I have to bail. So I'm on my way back down. And this is almost a cherry on top. I'm now seeing so many people come up the mountain. Okay, like, six people, which is a lot for. There was nobody out in the morning. So now with the weather turning, why in God's name would anybody be heading up the mountain, Let alone. The people that I saw were the most underprepared people. Some of them did not have any kind of packs. This one woman who I passed, she had, like, a small day pack, and she didn't look at me. And everyone just seemed like in really bad moods. I swear to God, it was just the woman weirdest thing coming down the mountain and I'm like, what are all these people doing? Because I was hustling to get off. Like it was getting really windy. Anyway, I'm almost done with the trail. I'm back to the parking lot or like the pull off and there are only two cars there, my car and one other car, the same car that was there in the morning. So I don't know where all those people came from. I don't know where their cars were parked. It was bizarre. I had so many heebie jeebies. But I get back in my car, I drive home. I think it might have been like a day passed and I was trying to fall asleep and I was just overcome with horrifying dread and panic and had a full on panic attack. And I was thinking about how something saw me that I wasn't supposed to be seen by. And I think that was just fear of the unknown overcoming me. Like that's since gone. I don't think there was any real merit to that. But you know humans, they don't get that kind of feeling when they see another human. But there is, I feel like a bit of an instinctual thing in us that can identify when something is off. I did become slightly obsessed with that trail. I think I've hiked that trail five times now. But the last time I was out there, I saw actual humans from across the way. And it was gut wrenching how tiny human beings look from across the way of that valley. I could barely see them. And I remember watching and I was like, maybe that's a child. And I'm like, no, that's an adult. Humans just look really small from that distance. I talked to my therapist a lot about this and it's funny, she. She's like, yeah, it was maybe aliens. Oh, okay. I have some park ranger friends. I've shown them the video. They can't identify what it was. And I feel like I've been hoping for something like this to happen to me just to drop into my lap to sort of prove that there is more to this existence. And it's so frustrating that something was dropped onto my lap. I have a video of it and I still can't fully believe what I saw. I don't know. Crazy stuff, huh? But thank you. Bye.
71: [Speaker A] Thank you, caller. Incredible. Now, let's start by going through a few notes that I took while listening to the call. First off, I wonder if you didn't will these things into existence, caller, after all, you did ask the universe for an alien encounter, so perhaps it obliged. Another thing that I took note of is the fact that our caller heard a turkey gobble, but saw a turkey vulture. They're called that because they look like turkeys, not because they sound like them. But I have no idea how that would play into this story. And the last thing that I took note of was the suggestion that these might have been mountain goats. Now, out of curiosity, I looked it up. A very large mountain goat could be 8ft on its hind legs. So I guess that theory is technically possible. But I'm not sure it holds water. Frankly, I spent way too long digging through photos of this area. But I was able to confirm that the video was shot where our caller said it was. That much we can confirm. And as for that video, it's exactly what our caller said it was. There are two videos in a handful of photographs, and they all seem to show the exact same thing. 2 or sometimes 3. 3 tall human looking figures standing along a distant ridge. The figures all seem to be dressed head to toe in white. And at a certain point, they do seem to morph like she said they did. It's all kind of hard to explain, so it would be best to just view the videos for yourself. You can find them in the photographs on our website at monsters among us podcast.com and by clicking on the Show Notes tab. I'll get this up on Instagram and Facebook soon as well, but I highly suggest you take a look. Now, this might be the point where you're asking yourself, where do the mirrored men come into all of this? Well, if you watch the video, you'll see that all three figures look, look nearly identical. That is, when they're not morphing in shape, they're standing in a way that gives the impression that they're mirroring movements as well, though they're too far away to actually confirm that they are. But the real clues can be found in our caller story. She mentioned it was rainy and foggy. Bad odd or inclement weather is a direct symptom of a mirroredman experience. She mentioned that she was in the middle of nowhere, only miles from the Canadian border, there in northern Washington. Well, that's exactly the sort of place where these mirrored men encounters occur. Checking off another box. And finally, the detail that made it all snap together for me. The missing time. She'd mentioned that she stood and filmed the figures for nearly 15 minutes, yet she only had 2 minutes and 1 second worth of video to show for it. Where did those other 12 minutes and 59 seconds go? And were the mirrored men responsible for that lapse in time? Now, was her collary another victim in a long line of experiencers of this past bizarre phenomena? Or is there a logical explanation to what took place there that day? Take a look at the video, take a look at the photos, have a look at the material that I gathered, and make up your own mind. Whatever it was, I'm intrigued. Now before I go, I did manage to find a few other photos. The particular peak these figures are standing under. And in one of those images, off in the distance behind where the three figures stood, you can see a single solitary person standing near the top of the mountain. If this is indeed a person, it really fogs the lens of perspective. In regards to our caller's video, it almost suggests that these white figures are inches tall rather than feet. But like I said, go take a look. Perhaps you're familiar with the area and can shed some light on the subject. Or maybe you know of a way to access photos from that same vantage point. Something that could help us determine just how big these things actually were. But until then, I'll wait patiently. 888-6089 or shoot us an email at monsters among us podcastmail.com Be sure to let us know if you have any additional information. And one more time, a big thanks to our caller for sharing this amazing entry. The story gives off moose lady vibes and I love it.

76: [Speaker A] Is an emergency situation. Now tonight's Sacred call comes to us fresh from Peter in the state of Tennessee.
77: [Speaker F] Hey Derek, this is Peter from Tennessee. I don't actually have a story. This is a friend of mine. She lives in Wisconsin. One night when she was a teenager she was taking buried and this was in the dead of night one after midnight. And if you know anything about my friend that is very on brand for her because she's kind of a wild child. She's always been that equal since she was a little girl. Anyway, so she's picking berries and she all of a sudden notices a presence and dead in front of her is a faceless thing. This thing stands up and as it stands up it sort of has leaves sort of like she described it as Batman. Like, well he has his cape covering his body and this thing stood about 7ft tall. She said it was faceless and didn't let off scream, didn't do anything. Just there she was petrified for about 30 seconds and then dropped her basket. A fairy picked up her dog and fled to her house. I tend to believe this encounter because because she has had in her family not just to her but to her grandparents had many paranormal either supernatural sightings. Her grandparents actually they had a incident with UFO in which they had missing time. Anyway, I love your program. I will do whatever you want. Thanks Derek. Bye.
78: [Speaker A] The audio was a little rough there at the beginning, but I think we got the gist of it. His friend was berry picking when she encountered the beast. That part was difficult to hear on some devices. But anyway, it's that detail that makes the story so interesting to me because many a monster encounter has occurred thanks to berry picking. But you know, there is another detail that caught my ear immediately. Wings. And given the description, one creature immediately came to mind. Bat Squatch. That bat winged blue haired bigfoot like creature said to come from beneath Mount St. Helens when it exploded back in 1980. Now it may sound a bit silly, but the descriptions are eerily similar. Whatever the creature was, I'm sure running into it at night in the woods was terrifying. So thank you again Peter for sharing your friend's tale. And folks, that takes us to the point of no return.

You could be hearing calls like Greg's out of the state of Tennessee.
79: [Speaker F] Hey Derek, this is Greg in East Tennessee. So this will be the summer of 78 or 79 in high school. First car, free cell phone, free computer, none of that stuff. As in a small town, Bristol, Tennessee, working at a fast food restaurant. And during the summer, hot summer nights, one of our favorite things to do was hire as many people as we could get into a car and do what we called the Haunted tour. As we would just drive around. It was usually 11 or 12 when we got off, but everybody's all wired up. We would drive around to all the spooky and scary places that we knew was Tri City up there in East Tennessee. There was in Bristol, Virginia called the haunted trestle. You know, train trestle. You'd pull under it, stop the car and just dark and scary. And it had the local urban legend of somebody's boyfriend being killed out above the car. Blood drips down and whatnot. And then there was a haunted tunnel in Kingsport we'd go to that supposedly had ghost people who had been run over and you could see them flying time to time. And anyhow we would drive around to these various haunts, scare the girls, have fun, and usually the last spot was close to where we were coming back to work and everybody would go back to their respective houses and whatnot. We called it the Witch's house. It was just a regular neighborhood, you know, 60, 70 ranch house type neighborhood, but there was one house in it.
