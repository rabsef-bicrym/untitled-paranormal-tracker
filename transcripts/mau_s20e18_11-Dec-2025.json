It's great to have you with us for another intriguing installment. We have a real barn burner lined up for you tonight. Plenty of the weird, the strange and the unusual. And that's exactly where we're gonna start here this evening with a peculiar call from an anonymous source north of the border. Hi, I'm calling from Ontario, Canada. I'll state anonymous My story has to do with the passing of my mom. She passed away in our home. She had cancer and she fought bravely for many months. But eventually she passed away on a hospital bed that we had downstairs in our living room. The night that she passed they ended up taking her to a type of morgue, but she had passed away and she stayed in the house for a little while. We had family come and pay their respects and so that night I ended up sleeping upstairs in her bed. I Just wanted to, I guess, feel close to her. So I went to sleep in her bed. Sometime there during the night, I got up and I went to the kitchen. And so to get to my kitchen, you had to go down some stairs and then to the left. When you finally got to the main floor, if you looked to the left, that was the living room. Straight ahead was the kitchen. And as I was passing the living room, I glanced over to the left and I saw what. I don't know how to describe it, but it was like a black mass. It was blacker than black. And it was just like this kind of a blob just there in the living room, right where she had passed, this dark, dark mass. And I remember looking at it and being like, okay, that's weird. And there were no lights on, but there was lights from the outside. And you know, you could kind of see the furniture and that. But that particular area was very dark. And I just kind of went to the kitchen, got something, I can't remember what. And I went back upstairs and actually just kind of went back to bed. At some point during the night, my brother wakes me up. Now, my brother slept in the basement. Wakes me up, scares the bejesus out of me. He's standing in the doorway. At this point, we're grown adults. And he says to me, I can't sleep, I can't sleep downstairs. I said, why? And he says to me, well, I can see like a black mass seeping down into my room, coming from above. And above his room and that he lived in the basement, was the living room. So he was seeing whatever I was seeing from below. Until very recently, I didn't know this, but we talked about it again. My mom passed about 11 years ago. And he told me when he saw that seeping down, he went upstairs and he went to the living room and looked same area that I was looking at. He told me that he not only saw darkness mass, but he could see like a sparkling, like a stardust swirling within that dark mass. He said that the feeling he got from wasn't good. He always felt like it could have been maybe some kind of opening of some kind of portal or something, but just mind boggling because I saw it and he saw it. Anyways. Love your show. Thank you. Thank you, caller. What do you think, folks? What do you suppose this was? One of those shadow entities, A portal, as our caller's brother suggested? Or could it possibly have been moment back for one last visit in the only form that she could muster? Well, it's Wild stuff, caller. Despite the explanation and the details about the glittery effect the shadow had, that really had me intrigued. Well, thank you again, caller, for kicking things off here tonight in what a way to start the episode. And folks, I have a whole lot more in store for you here tonight. And we're gonna get after it right after these messages. And he's way over and then he comes up and he hooks the ball to the left side.

Oh, like that's how quick that happens. Now then, let's visit an infamously haunted tavern, shall we? Please welcome Bird from my state of California. Hello, Derek and company. My name is Bird and I'm from Los Angeles, California. The Silver Lake area, to be very specific. My husband is a location manager and we were on location in Santa Paula, California around 2007. We were staying at the Glen Tavern Inn, which has a historical participation in a horrible tragedy. A dam burst close by a long. Time ago in the early 1900s and a lot of people died. And the Glen Tavern Inn became a refuge for survivors. It wasn't as if situation. Plus there were two murders in the hotel. I believe one was a prostitute and that was in 307. That's a very, very known haunted room. And then one was a gambler Lost his life. Oh, and by the way, I knew. All about this place historically and paranormally. Prior before walking in. So we had to stay three nights and the first two were sent in. The renovated suite where there was no activity whatsoever. I actually walked the halls at midnight. Using my phone looking for paranormal trouble and I found none. Anyway, so on the last night of our stay, we were in the room. Directly below where the murder of the. Prostitute occurred, which was 207. I heard some talk about her head. Being removed, her body, but I don't know. I was a smoker at the time and an insomniac. I awoke about 5 o' clock to go downstairs outside to smoke and sit in the lobby afterwards. Is grand, all dark hardwood everywhere. It was really beautiful hotel. I lounged about the lobby because it was busy with people and activities as well as being pretty. Even though I was not participating in the activities, it was fun to watch. The first people were early birds running to catch their hot air balloons, which is an annual activity. Then the second thing that happened was this big travel bus that said Antelope Valley Paranormal Investigators or something like that. I talked to a few of the participants people on the bus for a long time, about an hour and a half. And we had a lot in common. Especially when I mentioned a fairly famous local English medium named Brian. I forgot his last name. And he was just so fabulous. And we all confirmed our love for him. So now I return to my husband and I've been gone for two good hours. Smoking and talking and talking and smoking. When I came back, I was met with adoration and just like anxiety as well. He pulled me into the bed. He wanted to spoon. Now this was not the kind of man who showed his affection that way. He was affectionate. He would know, hold me and kiss me. But he never wanted to really cuddle in bed. That was not his thing at all. Anyway, so then he tells me what happened while I was gone. He had been somewhat of a skeptic. He claims he woke up with something and what he believed was my arm sticking straight up in the air under the covers. And he swatted it down only to find it was my king size pillow propped up perfectly straight under the COVID stiff and kept a blanket up like a tent. He was kind of freaked out. He was like what's this? Doesn't even know what to make of it. And he goes into nail quickly. So he shakes it off and goes to the bathroom. And when he comes back it's back up straight again under the covers. It completely freaked him out and he just didn't know what to do. And it was this old pillow on top of it. It was old and soft, so it's hard to be stiff. It's kind of impossible for it to be stiff. Death under there. So anyway, I'm so glad to share the story. Thank you for your hard work. Please know we appreciate every minute. Bye. Well, you know, Bird, it's either hard work or we're hardly working. Despite the long hours the show requires, most of the time it doesn't feel like quote unquote work. And for that I'm extremely thankful. And I'm thankful for your entry here, Bird as well. Now, Bird touched on a lot of the activity reported there at the Glen Tavern Inn, but believe it or not, she missed a few pivotal reports. So here with a full list of experiences is a local investigator named Sammy ruiz. Built in 1911, the Glen Tavern Inn housed a speakeasy, brothel and gambling den during the prohibition. Celebrities such as John Wayne, Carol Lombard and Harry Houdini were said to be regulars at the hotel. It is said that room 307 is haunted by a woman named Rose who was possibly beheaded in the room. Room 308 is said to be haunted by Calvin, a cowboy who was shot over a card game when the third floor was used as a gambling den. His ghost is seen wearing a bullet riddled hat. Guest and paranormal investigators have reported ghostly children laughing in the halls, phantom footsteps, objects flying off dressers, and eerie voices caught in recordings. The hotel has been featured on Ghost. Adventures and the Dead Files, solidifying its status as one of SoCal's most haunted hotels. Now, Sammy is a great source on information regarding SoCal hauntings. So if you're local and curious, there's a link to his account in the show notes. And if you find yourself in Santa Paula, California, swing by the Glen Tavern. Maybe you too will experience one of these mysterious phenomena. And thank you again Bird for sharing the legend here with us. And folks, if you too have a story you would like to have shared here on the the program, give me a call at 888-608-night.

Hey Derek, My name is John. This story comes from when I was living up Pennsylvania. I'd say it was 2017 and it was hunting season, late November, early December. I was hunting at a farm that my father in law and I used to go to. And this morning I was just going by myself. I was off of work in the middle of the week, but I decided to go hunting out there. So I went out to the Grego farm out in Pennsylvania and I went down to a tree stand spot that I'd picked out earlier in the season. I'd say I roughly got there about 5:00 in the morning, got up into my tree stand and I was just sitting there facing the open cornfield. And behind me was a very large sinkhole they used to refer to as the quarry, and there was a small stream that used to run back behind there. But while I was sitting there, I used to know the pretty normal sounds that went on around that farm. I've been there a couple times, so it was just like any other normal morning. And then for some reason I was up in my stand and all of a sudden I got a sense that something else was there. I didn't know exactly what it was and everything seemed to get dead quiet. Then I got hit in the face with this odor and it kind of smelled like a wet animal, wet dog, something of that nature. And the hairs on the back of my neck stood up and I was, for the first time in a long time I was really scared and I felt that something was looking at me. I didn't look to see what it was. I didn't want to, in the back of my mind was saying, you don't want to see it, you don't want it to see you see it. I sat there in the stand for a few minutes and then finally it seemed a sense of whatever was there went away. I don't know what it was, I didn't see it. But that's my story. What was it? I don't know. But it was so real to me that as soon as day broke I got down out of the stand. I didn't even sit around to wait to go hunting. And I just got back in my truck and I went home. Thank you. Have a good day and thank your staff. Thank you, John, for calling in. And yes, a huge thanks to my staff, Sarah Delaney Connor. And we have several volunteers that help with our discord and Facebook. Sarah and John currently, I believe, and of course my mom as well, who is back in Ohio manning the shop. So I agree, John, a huge thanks to our staff. Now, as for the feeling of being observed, sensing an unseen and unnerving presence, and that peculiar odor, to me, that only points to one possible suspect. Bigfoot. After all, the creature is said to have an intense stare and even emit a low frequency that can stun prey and predators alike. And everyone knows that personal hygiene is not high on their list. Legends persist about how badly these cryptids are said to smell like a hot dumpster, a wet dog, a musty locker room, or that barnyard smell. Almost exactly what John described here. And you know, Pennsylvania is a state that's had its fair share of Bigfoot experiences. It currently ranks 12th in number of sightings in the country on the BFRO website. And I'll tell you, that ain't nothing. So I guess making that assumption isn't too crazy, John. And to be honest, it's even more believable after you hear this story that Delaney dug up. While researching this story, a report made to the Bigfoot field researchers. Organization sensation. An encounter that occurred the very same year that John's dead and in the very same month that Johnstead and in the very same week Johnstead as well. Deer season. And get this, it occurred only three miles away from that exact location. The following was pulled directly from that report. I went into my woods. I was sitting at my deer spot. And after sitting for about an hour, a few deer ran through the woods. They acted as if something was pushing them. A few seconds later, a Sasquatch, seven to eight foot tall and reddish brown, came following them. Now, I realize there's not much to go on there, but luckily for us, BFRO investigator Nate Moyer made a follow up. Now, the following was pulled directly from Moyer's follow up interview. The witness told me additional stories from the surrounding area. Most of the family has seen some sort of unexplained activity. Howls, knocks, and whoops. They even had 45 chickens that through the years were all taken or killed. He told me some were taken by an owl, but most were not. They had ducks that were killed and left in the enclosure. The heads were pulled off the ducks and left there in a pile. The doe he shot was not concerned with them being there. It was more worried about something behind it. After the deer was shot, a figure emerged from the thicket. It was tall, seven to eight foot, walking on two legs. It approached the dead deer and looked directly at the witness. He was frozen in place and could only watch as it disappeared back up the hill. Now, you know, I think the most concerning detail of that report is that whatever this thing was, it didn't seem to be phased by gunfire. That doesn't bode well for anyone caught in the woods of eastern Pennsylvania, armed or not. Now we appreciate that story, John, and if anyone from that area has any insight or an experience of their own, of course we'd love to hear about it. But until then, thanks again John for calling in.

Now in the number four slot here this evening is seven calling in from the state of Tennessee. Hey Derek, it's seven from middle Tennessee. So I was just listening to episode 17 of season 17 and the disembodied voices calling a name brought up an old memory I'd completely forgot. So this had been 2003. I was working the late shift in an all night gas station and it was just me by Myself, and I'm kind of milling about the store, just facing stock dusting, you know, just regular stuff. And I'm bent down dusting a shelf. And then out of nowhere, it sounds like somebody came up to the left side of me and goes, seven right in my ear. Now this is so loud, I actually jumped up. I was kneeling down at the shelf and I jumped straight up, stood, looked around, thought, okay, somebody just snuck up on me. And it was a fairly small all night gas station, so there wasn't a lot of room to hide. So walked all around the store, didn't see anybody. None of the door chimes had gone off to let me know that anybody had come in or gone out. It was just very strange. That's the only time in my life that's ever happened that I've heard a disembodied voice call my name. And like I said, it was so loud, it actually made me physically jump up. Now, I will say to this, I do suffer from audio pareidola. For those of you that don't know, my brain will tune into white noise and tries to make it sound coherent sound. Though sometimes it'll sound like music, music where you just can't quite catch the lyrics. Sometimes it'll sound like muffled conversation, but never has it ever been clearly audible and sounded just like my name. Now, I will say that at the time I was working in this gas station, there was no piped in music. There was nothing particularly loud. Just me in the quiet. Anyways, Derek, just thought I would share. Have a great day. Thank you, seven, for ringing in. But, you know, I can think of a few worse things that can happen to someone at a late night gas station, But I can't think of too many things that would be creepier than what seven just detailed. For me, it's not so much the disembodied voice, although that in itself is unsettling. It's the proximity that voice had to our witness. Now, he just mentioned this on Tuesday's show, but for that voice to be right in your ear like that, that means that whoever or whatever is saying it has got to be right next to you. And the weird part about it is these witnesses don't even realize it until that entity speaks up. And that's the part that makes my skin crawl. And unfortunately for you, seven, you know this experience firsthand. And we appreciate you sharing those details here with us. Now, folks, let's shift gears here a bit. This next entry details one of those unidentified flying objects, the description of which we don't hear about all that often. So please welcome Mary out of the state of Virginia. Hello, Derek. My name is Mary and I'm calling from Virginia. However, even though I'm calling from Virginia, my story actually takes place in Massachusetts. The South Shore. That's the area between Boston and the Cape. And this took place in the 90s. I was a teenager at the time, like an older teenager. I was in a car with my dad and my stepmother. And it was about dusk, and we were driving to my mom's place where my dad was gonna drop me off. Suddenly my dad's like, what's that? I see something in the sky. I look out the window and I think it's like a low flying aircraft. At first, however, my dad's kind of spooked. And the thing is, my dad is not an easy to spook type of guy. He has, like, a background in science, so he is very skeptical about these things. But it scared him enough that he pulled over, he got out of the car, and my stepmother can see it because she's, like, sitting next to him. And I'm in the back. I can't quite see it. She's like, tommy, please don't go. Don't go out there and look. My dad was just like, I want to know what that is. So he got out of the car and he starts staring up at the sky. I can't get a really good look at it. So I get out. My stepmother is protesting, but I want to see what my dad's looking at. As I get out, I see. At first, like I said, I thought it was an aircraft, but it was not a plane. It couldn't have been a plane. It was hexagon shaped and it was very big. And I could see kind of some lights blinking, which is why I thought it was a plane at first. But I knew it definitely wasn't a plane because of how low it was flying and how big it was. And also, there was this, like, vent on the back of it that had this pulsing glow that was coming from it, like it was magma or something like that. Something just slowly glowing, like switching from glowing red to glowing orange and back again. That really frightened me. But I couldn't stop staring at it because I really wanted to figure out what it was. And my dad was just kind of frozen in disbelief himself. And we just watched it, and it kind of hovered over us for a little bit before it headed on. We couldn't hear anything. Then we saw it just kind of disappear below the tree line. So we got in and my dad didn't mention it. He didn't talk about it. He never mentioned it again. And my stepmother started to, but my dad cut her off and we just kind of drove on. I always still think about that UFO to this day. I could never tell you what it is, and I still think about it. My dad never mentioned it. My dad passed in 2016 and I kind of wish I asked him about it if he ever figured out what it was. But I think since he couldn't explain it and figure it out, he preferred just to kind of ignore it. But I'm kind of the opposite. I kind of wanted to know more about it. There is a redux to this story. Like a part two. I was just visiting with my brother over the weekend and I was telling him about this because I'd never told him about this UFO story before. And he grew white when I told it to him. And he said, that's very strange that you tell this story. And I was like, why? And he's like a friend of mine, this older guy, he owned like an independently owned store down the harbor. And apparently this older guy said that he believed in UFOs. He had seen three UFOs in the same area from the time he was a child until he was an adult. And he saw it three times and it was always near the beach. Where we were was kind of near the beach. It wasn't quite on the beach, but it was near the beach. And he had said that it was hexagon shaped and that kind of, you know, it leans credence to my story. It kind of made me feel like, oh, so what I saw was maybe not that unusual after all. I'd be curious to hear if there's anybody else that had UFO sightings, especially hexagon shaped UFOs in the South Shore area of Massachusetts. I did look in Project Blue Book, the stuff that was released, and I saw reference to a UFO in my hometown where I saw this UFO in the 60s. I can't remember if I recalled it being hexagon shaped or not, but it was at the beach. And I always, when my brother mentioned it, I was wondering if that was the same one that this older gentleman shopkeeper had mentioned. Anyways, love the podcast. Have a good day. Thank you, Mary, for calling in. Well, you know, we might have something for you here. The following encounter was reported to the National UFO Reporting center and occurred in Haverhill, Massachusetts, which is only about 38 miles as the UFO flies from where the experience in Mary's story occurred. Here is that report. It was a clear night. The UFO appeared straight overhead. It moved across the sky at about two times the speed of a jet. The UFO was a hexagon. It was about 50ft off the ground. It flew right over us. My grandfather and I were sitting there talking, and we heard a swishing sound. I looked up and told him to look, and we saw a thin hexagon, two times the size of an airplane, fly across the sky at an amazing pace. It had flashing lights that changed colors. The colors on it were unexplainable, and I never saw them before. Then it disappeared, and we never saw it again. Per usual, you can find a link to everything mentioned in tonight's show by visiting our website and clicking the Show Notes tab at Monsters Among Us podcast dot com. Now, truth be told, that encounter that I just read occurred In June of 2009, decades after Mary's encounter. But given the description and the location, I figured it was close enough. Close enough to prove something strange might be going on in the skies above Massachusetts. So thank you again, Mary, for leaving us your story and putting us on the path of discovery. Now, folks, grab your scuba gear, because we're venturing into the splash zone. Please welcome Maria, out of the Sunshine State. Hi, my name is Maria, and I'm calling from central Florida. But this story actually belongs to my father, and it takes place in the country of Nicaragua. My father was about 12 years old, so this would have been around 1956. So it was a very long time ago. This occurred on a farm in Nicaragua that belonged to his family. So a lot of what would happen is when school would get out and they would go on vacation, a lot of, you know, my father's cousins, their parents would send them to his aunt's farm to go work and kind of spend vacation. And they would go and they'd do a lot of stuff on the farm. And on this one such day, he went out with a wagon and a mule. And one of the workers on the farm, who was an older gentleman, probably in his late 40s, and my father was 12 at the time. And they went out to the property. His aunt actually happened to own quite a large amount of land. And right next to the farm is a large, inactive volcano that has a lagoon inside in the middle. It's actually called Apoyeke. And they actually happen to own half of that volcano. And so they used that very fertile land to plant things. And they also used it for their cattle to graze, which is one of the main things that they had on the farm and on this day they took the wagon, they had to go up the side of the mountain up to the very top. I've actually visited it myself. Once you get to the very top, you can kind of look down you and you see a large lagoon in the middle, just like a lake, you know, very beautiful. So my father on that day, I would say was around the afternoon, early afternoon, there was still plenty of light and they were cutting plantains up there at the very top. And my father says that him and his companion saw a craft emerge from the water and kind of hover very quietly. It made absolutely no sound from what my father says. He said it was kind of cigar shaped and it kind of came out of the water, kind of hovered above, you know, almost at the top of the crater a little bit, and then just went right back down and went back in the water. And I think at the time, I don't Even know if UFOs were even a thing that people talked about, especially in a Latin American country in the 50s. They would have had a very limited amount of, you know, technology news. So my father is actually a very educated man. He's very well read, and he says to this day he's not found any kind of aircraft and books that would resemble what he saw. He says the closest thing in terms of behavior would be like a stealth aircraft. It kind of hovers quietly, doesn't really make a lot of sound. He says that's the closest thing in terms of behavior. But in terms of look, cigar shaped, all metal, no real markings, nothing to really identify where it was from. Several years later, I would say around the 70s, he did have a conversation with some military people from Nicaragua who he shared the story with. And they happened to mention that they had several other military people, you know, witness that sort of thing in and around the area, in some parts of Nicaragua. So they're not exactly sure. I'm not sure if it's some kind of like advanced aircraft that existed at the time, maybe belonging to the United States. Maybe they were concealing it, be looking for some rural areas to conceal it. I'm not sure that's entirely possible. I just know that him and his companion both witnessed that. And to this day, my father is not really sure what kind of craft that was. Thank you and keep up the good work. I really love your podcast and I'm glad I have a place to share all these crazy stories. Bye. Thanks, Maria. You know, they call those USOs, unidentified submerged objects and they're essentially a UFO underwater. And believe it or not, the world is full of hot spots where these things are witnessed frequently. The waters in and near the legendary Bermuda Triangle, the world's deepest lake, Lake Baikal in Russia, Lake Michigan here in the US The Gulf of Mexico, the Sea of Japan, the Black Sea, and most notably, perhaps the waters off the coast of Southern California, specifically around Catalina island, all the way up to the Santa Barbara area. But in reality, these things are seen all over. And if I didn't know any better, I'd say that Maria's father saw one as well. And as Maria alluded to, the fact that it took place all the way back in 1956 is certainly noteworthy. So amazing stuff. Maria, we thank you again for preserving your father's experience here with us. And what an experience it was. Five of them were prepared. Five of them were not. One a little bit higher able to.

Now, folks, I guess I have another unidentified flying object story to share with you this evening, but this is not your conventional sighting. Jessica from Canada, please explain. Hi, Derek, it's Jessica. I live in Canada, in Quebec, kind of in a rural area in the Gatineau park area of Quebec. I'm calling today because I heard a story where someone had reported seeing something like a translucent bat, and it was the first time I Was kind of excited about what me and my husband had seen four or five years ago. So I thought I would tell my story and see if it was at all close to the same sighting. So my husband and I were visiting my parents in Ottawa, Ontario and they live in a, you know, not a suburban area. It's like quite city esque and an older neighborhood. And we were both smokers at the time. So we went outside after dinner with our drinks and we went out in the backyard, a tiny backyard, you know, close to all the other backyards. We sat out and had a cigarette and chatted. It was around probably 10:30pm, really nice night, not cloudy, fairly clear. I didn't notice it was windy or anything, although it's been a while now, so I can't remember too many details. And as we were chatting about God knows what, I look up to my left above the horizon like beside my parents neighbor's house and I see this, what looks like a V shaped big pair of wings moving in this like kind of mechanical way, like they're flapping but they're like illuminated. I couldn't see really a body, just the wings, like the way you would like draw arches for a seagull. And I saw them and I told my husband, hey, do you see that? Like what is that? Is it a drone? And we look and he's dumbfounded and so am I. And we're just kind of looking at it. It's kind of shaky, flapping, mechanical, very high up in the sky, but not high enough where it would be like plane height, I can't gauge, maybe you know, 100ft, 150ft, I don't know. And it was moving away from us and then all of a sudden another one appeared right beside it, kind of in tandem and they were both flapping and moving away from us and we just watched them in total awe, having zero clue what it could be. It didn't look like a drone, it didn't look fully mechanical. It looked like it was, I don't know, almost like it was an animal. But also this illuminated, mechanical jerking motion. I've never seen anything like it. I've never seen anything like it again. And we both looked at each other and thought this is definitely a UFO of some kind. So I did tons of research to try and find any like Google description that might be the same. And I couldn't find anything at all that looked UFO wise like anything we had seen. And it was only when I heard that story about the kind of translucent bat sighting that I thought, oh, that's kind of really similar to, at least visually what we saw. I don't know if the motions were the same, but certainly visually sounded really similar. And when I saw the picture, I thought, okay, from far away, that's probably really similar to what we were looking at. So that's my story. I hope it's useful. Thanks again for everything. Have a great day. Bye. Thank you, Jessica, for calling in. You know, I could name a bunch of things that this might have been, including but not limited to some sort of large bird, a vulture perhaps, or a paraglider maybe. Or was it one of those ornithopters? If you don't know what that is, check out the show notes. But the truth here is I have no idea what it is that Jessica and her partner saw that day. But if you do, you know how to reach me monsters among us podcastmail.com or give me a call 888-6089. Whatever it was you saw, Jessica, you did the right thing by sharing it with us. Maybe someone out there can help us identify it. Thanks again for calling in. Now enough of the flying objects. Let's explore a ghost or two. Please welcome Eli to the program. Hi, my name is Eli. I've been a long time listener of the show, like literally since season one, but I have been recently catching back up. So I'm in season 19 and there's been a couple of stories about faceless entities and I wanted to call in my own story. So I'm from Michigan and I live downriver. The house that I lived in had I could not even count how many odd happenings, ghost sightings of everyone who visited. But the one that I'm going to talk about today is the faceless woman I would see both in dreams and when I was awake. It was always a very benign kind of experience, but it was very odd. The most notable time that I ever had anything happen, I woke up at night and I slept in the basement of my parents house. So it was always very dark and pretty cold as it was. But I woke up from a dead sleep for whatever reason and sat up and looked around trying to see if maybe the dog was making a sound or somebody had done something in the house and they didn't see anything. But when I turned to the other side of my bed, there was a woman sitting there. She had long black hair like a red dress with a white apron. And even in the moment I thought it was very odd that I could make out all these details because it was so dark. But when she turned to me, she had no face, like no facial features at all. It was just like a blank slate of where a face should be. And her whole appearance, all of it seems to glow. Like I could make out all these details despite it being very dark. And she just kind of turned and looked at me and then patted the end of the bed as if, like to tell me to go back to sleep. Like you know you would do for a kid. Like you just pat the pillow. For whatever reason I did, I just laid back down and went back to sleep and. And I would have never thought to tell this story except for a couple years later at a sleepover. All of us were telling scary stories. You know, we were watching the horror movies and telling scary stories that we had experienced or whatever. And one of my friends told the exact same story. They said they woke up one night and there was just a woman sitting on the bed. Explained her the exact same way. Long black hair, red dress, with a white apron and no face. And I thought that was so weird. So I had to tell them that. And then hearing these stories be told Both in season 18, I think, episode 47 and season 19, I don't remember what episode. I just thought it was very interesting that this was something that occurred to a lot of people. So I just wanted to go ahead and share my story. Keep up the awesome work. I hope to continue listening to your podcast for many years to come. Thanks. Thank you, Eli, for calling in a faceless woman. Definitely spooky. And he's right, you know, from time to time we do receive this sort of report, though I'm not sure exactly what it is being reported. Is it a perception issue? Maybe the spirit has trouble fully manifesting, which results in a blurry face? Or is it that these entities never had a face to begin with? I guess both. Possibility is unsettling in its own way. Whatever the cause of the entity's missing mug, we thank you, Eli, for telling us all about her. Now, folks, time is running out.

Now, folks, let's close things out here tonight with a monster story from the state of Arizona. Please welcome Anonymous to the show. Hey, Derek, I'm gonna call this in anonymously from Arizona, but this story actually happened in Idaho about five years ago. So I was near Ketchum, which is close to Sun Valley, hunting black bears and wolves with my dad, and both of us saw just a really strange animal. The best way that I can describe it was it had the body of like a Himalayan tar, which if you look up what a Himalayan tar looks like, they're like a goat almost. They got very furry body, like a muskox. They had the body of that, but it had like the head of almost a moose. Like, I've seen basically every animal that could be found in that area. I've seen mountain goats, I've seen bighorn sheep, I've seen wolves, black bears, moose, elk. This was none of those. This was something I had never seen. And initially, since we first saw it in the early morning, I thought this was just a mountain goat that looked weird because of the lighting. But as the day drove on and we continued to watch this thing, we realized this is not a mountain goat. This is something entirely different. Now, if this had happened in like say, New Mexico, I could have just thought, oh, that's just the Himalayan tar, because they do have a feral population of tar there. But this happened in the mountains of Idaho in fall. We don't have tar here. And mountain goats, to my knowledge, aren't normally brown. So I just thought I'd call that in. If anybody else from Idaho has experienced something like that and know what that could have been, I would appreciate knowing. It's confused me for years. But thank you for letting us call in and share our weird stories like this. All right, bye. Thank you, caller. How's that for a mystery? Some sort of unidentified unculet. Let's break this call down a little further. For starters, I'm quick to think of the moose lady call from season 16, episode 14, a story from Eau Claire, Wisconsin that detailed a strange looking old woman carrying a suitcase that morphed into a moose like creature right before the witness's eyes. A chase later ensued. It was really quite an ordeal, and if you're not familiar, I highly recommend you track it down and give that story a listen. And there was also a similar story also out of the state of Wisconsin that seemed to describe another moose like creature thrashing on a beach on either Lake Superior, Lake Michigan, I can't recall. Now, it sounds like our caller is quite familiar with all the creatures of that area and so am I, if I'm honest. And just like our caller, I also can't think of a single mammal that should be in that area that matches that description. I searched a list of invasive species. I searched high and low for any known cryptid from the Gem State, and I didn't find a single thing that I think I could even remotely attach to the animal in our color story. And that's where the trail went cold for me until my editor, Connor, suggested a call from last season that just might detail the exact same creature. Now, this story originally aired on season 19, episode 18. How many of you remember this entry from Dee in the state of Idaho? Hi, Derek. This is Dan from Idaho. So this is high school friends story that I just recently learned about because I haven't seen him since my senior year. After we graduated, he went into the military and he got stationed up in Alaska. And what he would do whenever they weren't doing anything on the base is he would go with some of his friends on base, and they'd find places off base to go, you know, fishing or hiking or just generally exploring. So they were doing this one day. And what he described to me is he saw what he thought was a moose in a bunch of willows. And when this thing walked out of the willows, it was something with the body of a moose, but it had the face of, like, a person almost. But it didn't look like a person. Its face was all, like, distorted. It looked burned almost. And on top of that, it had the antlers of a caribou. Now, I've never heard of any sort of cryptid or native legend that is like this, so I truthfully have no idea what this thing could be. But I feel like it is just a really strange story from one of my buddies that I had never heard because I had just recently talked to him since he moved down here after the military. Okay, bye. Thanks again. D. I don't know, folks. What do you think? Do we have a match? I'm not so sure myself, but the two tails are certainly similar enough to warrant this comparison. But this actually is where the trail goes cold. So as I often do, I'm reaching out to you listeners. Who among you has the answers that we seek? Who knows what this creature was until that info trickles in? A big thanks to our caller and an even bigger thanks to you, listener, for joining me here this evening, because that's gonna do it for tonight.

Please welcome Caden out of the state of Kansas. Hi Derek, this is Caden. I live in Kansas, near the Missouri border. I was recently listening to the season 7 episode 19, grab bag episode fairly far behind, but it describes A disembodied hand. And it kind of brought up a memory that I had pushed away for a while because it pretty much Fs with my reality, if that makes sense. So I was in the car with two of my siblings, my younger brother and my younger sister, and I was driving them home from youth group. So this would have been probably eight or nine at night, pretty dark. And we were just driving down the highway and we were about to get on the exit ramp and I saw something in my headlights just in the middle of the exit ramp, very low to the ground. I couldn't quite make it out until we got up close to it. But as we got up close to it, I could see that it was a disembodied hand. And I had zero idea what I was looking at. I was completely dumbfounded. And I slow down and we literally have to wait for this thing to cross as it just walks in front of us across the exit ramp and into the ditch. And I mean, as you can imagine, my siblings and I just completely freaked out. We were just like, what in the hell was that? Was that a hand? We were just completely freaked out. We had no idea what was going on and we just drove away as if nothing happened. We never really brought it up to our parents or anything because, I mean, it's just the most ridiculous story you can imagine. So, yeah, that's my story. Thanks. Bye. Thank you, Cayden. You know, I'd like to think that this was simply a tarantula. A large hand sized tarantula, but a tarantula nonetheless. Otherwise, there's not much else out there that it could have been. Nothing to explain an experience like this. What I'm getting at is that there shouldn't be any severed hands in the middle of the road. I guess it might happen from time to time, but it's not something anyone should expect to run across. But to have that severed hand move on its own accord, that's something straight out of Netflix. Incredible stuff, Caden. That's about all I can say about that. And we really appreciate the entry. So thanks again for calling in.

Like I said, all for the price of a cheap cup of coffee. After all, it's in the beyond that we share wild tales like Amanda's different parts. But no. Hi, Derek. My name's Amanda. I'm originally from Kansas City, Missouri, which is where my experience happened. So my story is a little complicated because I've seen a lot of things throughout my life, but there's one story that specifically sticks out. But I'll start at the very beginning of this specific experience I still kind of think about often because I just kind of wonder if there was more to it than I thought. But it starts probably, like, eight years ago. this point. I was living in a studio apartment downtown Kansas City, and I had a really awful issue with a neighbor of mine. Actually, he started harassing me, and he lived underneath me. I would hear him screaming, and he would be shouting things like, get out. You're not welcome here. Leave. Leave me alone. And it was just scary because you just hear him start screaming that and slamming things around. But the part where it became an issue is he started harassing me. And there were multiple times where he just came up to my apartment, and he would knock on the door, and he'd be like, can I borrow toilet paper? And he's like, kind of look around behind me. Which was weird because, you know, he had neighbors on either side, but he came all the way upstairs to me, his upstairs neighbor. And then there was another time he came up to my apartment, and he was like, hey, is this person here? And I was like, no, the person not here. Me who lived here. And he's like, well, they told me they were here. And I'm like, I'm sorry, can't help you. They're not here. And the part where it kind of became like, an issue was there was, like, one night where he just chased me out of my apartment, and he just seemed kind of, like, frantic. And then once he saw me, I guess he heard me going outside, he ended up, like, just stopping.

She had cancer and she fought bravely for many months. But eventually she passed away on a hospital bed that we had downstairs in our living room. The night that she passed they ended up taking her to a type of morgue, but she had passed away and she stayed in the house for a little while. We had family come and pay their respects and so that night I ended up sleeping upstairs in her bed. I Just wanted to, I guess, feel close to her. So I went to sleep in her bed. Sometime there during the night, I got up and I went to the kitchen. And so to get to my kitchen, you had to go down some stairs and then to the left. When you finally got to the main floor, if you looked to the left, that was the living room. Straight ahead was the kitchen. And as I was passing the living room, I glanced over to the left and I saw what. I don't know how to describe it, but it was like a black mass. It was blacker than black. And it was just like this kind of a blob just there in the living room, right where she had passed, this dark, dark mass. And I remember looking at it and being like, okay, that's weird. And there were no lights on, but there was lights from the outside. And you know, you could kind of see the furniture and that. But that particular area was very dark. And I just kind of went to the kitchen, got something, I can't remember what. And I went back upstairs and actually just kind of went back to bed. At some point during the night, my brother wakes me up. Now, my brother slept in the basement. Wakes me up, scares the bejesus out of me. He's standing in the doorway. At this point, we're grown adults. And he says to me, I can't sleep, I can't sleep downstairs. I said, why? And he says to me, well, I can see like a black mass seeping down into my room, coming from above. And above his room and that he lived in the basement, was the living room. So he was seeing whatever I was seeing from below. Until very recently, I didn't know this, but we talked about it again. My mom passed about 11 years ago. And he told me when he saw that seeping down, he went upstairs and he went to the living room and looked same area that I was looking at. He told me that he not only saw darkness mass, but he could see like a sparkling, like a stardust swirling within that dark mass. He said that the feeling he got from wasn't good. He always felt like it could have been maybe some kind of opening of some kind of portal or something, but just mind boggling because I saw it and he saw it. Anyways. Love your show. Thank you.",

And for that I'm extremely thankful. And I'm thankful for your entry here, Bird as well. Now, Bird touched on a lot of the activity reported there at the Glen Tavern Inn, but believe it or not, she missed a few pivotal reports. So here with a full list of experiences is a local investigator named Sammy ruiz. Built in 1911, the Glen Tavern Inn housed a speakeasy, brothel and gambling den during the prohibition. Celebrities such as John Wayne, Carol Lombard and Harry Houdini were said to be regulars at the hotel. It is said that room 307 is haunted by a woman named Rose who was possibly beheaded in the room. Room 308 is said to be haunted by Calvin, a cowboy who was shot over a card game when the third floor was used as a gambling den. His ghost is seen wearing a bullet riddled hat. Guest and paranormal investigators have reported ghostly children laughing in the halls, phantom footsteps, objects flying off dressers, and eerie voices caught in recordings.",

      "text": "Hey Derek, My name is John. This story comes from when I was living up Pennsylvania. I'd say it was 2017 and it was hunting season, late November, early December. I was hunting at a farm that my father in law and I used to go to. And this morning I was just going by myself. I was off of work in the middle of the week, but I decided to go hunting out there. So I went out to the Grego farm out in Pennsylvania and I went down to a tree stand spot that I'd picked out earlier in the season. I'd say I roughly got there about 5:00 in the morning, got up into my tree stand and I was just sitting there facing the open cornfield. And behind me was a very large sinkhole they used to refer to as the quarry, and there was a small stream that used to run back behind there. But while I was sitting there, I used to know the pretty normal sounds that went on around that farm. I've been there a couple times, so it was just like any other normal morning. And then for some reason I was up in my stand and all of a sudden I got a sense that something else was there. I didn't know exactly what it was and everything seemed to get dead quiet. Then I got hit in the face with this odor and it kind of smelled like a wet animal, wet dog, something of that nature. And the hairs on the back of my neck stood up and I was, for the first time in a long time I was really scared and I felt that something was looking at me. I didn't look to see what it was. I didn't want to, in the back of my mind was saying, you don't want to see it, you don't want it to see you see it. I sat there in the stand for a few minutes and then finally it seemed a sense of whatever was there went away. I don't know what it was, I didn't see it. But that's my story. What was it? I don't know. But it was so real to me that as soon as day broke I got down out of the stand. I didn't even sit around to wait to go hunting. And I just got back in my truck and I went home. Thank you. Have a good day and thank your staff.",

      "text": "Thank you, John, for calling in. And yes, a huge thanks to my staff, Sarah Delaney Connor. And we have several volunteers that help with our discord and Facebook. Sarah and John currently, I believe, and of course my mom as well, who is back in Ohio manning the shop. So I agree, John, a huge thanks to our staff. Now, as for the feeling of being observed, sensing an unseen and unnerving presence, and that peculiar odor, to me, that only points to one possible suspect. Bigfoot. After all, the creature is said to have an intense stare and even emit a low frequency that can stun prey and predators alike. And everyone knows that personal hygiene is not high on their list. Legends persist about how badly these cryptids are said to smell like a hot dumpster, a wet dog, a musty locker room, or that barnyard smell. Almost exactly what John described here. And you know, Pennsylvania is a state that's had its fair share of Bigfoot experiences. It currently ranks 12th in number of sightings in the country on the BFRO website. And I'll tell you, that ain't nothing. So I guess making that assumption isn't too crazy, John. And to be honest, it's even more believable after you hear this story that Delaney dug up. While researching this story, a report made to the Bigfoot field researchers. Organization sensation. An encounter that occurred the very same year that John's dead and in the very same month that Johnstead and in the very same week Johnstead as well. Deer season. And get this, it occurred only three miles away from that exact location. The following was pulled directly from that report. I went into my woods. I was sitting at my deer spot. And after sitting for about an hour, a few deer ran through the woods. They acted as if something was pushing them. A few seconds later, a Sasquatch, seven to eight foot tall and reddish brown, came following them. Now, I realize there's not much to go on there, but luckily for us, BFRO investigator Nate Moyer made a follow up. Now, the following was pulled directly from Moyer's follow up interview. The witness told me additional stories from the surrounding area. Most of the family has seen some sort of unexplained activity. Howls, knocks, and whoops. They even had 45 chickens that through the years were all taken or killed. He told me some were taken by an owl, but most were not. They had ducks that were killed and left in the enclosure. The heads were pulled off the ducks and left there in a pile. The doe he shot was not concerned with them being there. It was more worried about something behind it. After the deer was shot, a figure emerged from the thicket. It was tall, seven to eight foot, walking on two legs. It approached the dead deer and looked directly at the witness. He was frozen in place and could only watch as it disappeared back up the hill. Now, you know, I think the most concerning detail of that report is that whatever this thing was, it didn't seem to be phased by gunfire. That doesn't bode well for anyone caught in the woods of eastern Pennsylvania, armed or not. Now we appreciate that story, John, and if anyone from that area has any insight or an experience of their own, of course we'd love to hear about it. But until then, thanks again John for calling in.

      "text": "Hey Derek, it's seven from middle Tennessee. So I was just listening to episode 17 of season 17 and the disembodied voices calling a name brought up an old memory I'd completely forgot. So this had been 2003. I was working the late shift in an all night gas station and it was just me by Myself, and I'm kind of milling about the store, just facing stock dusting, you know, just regular stuff. And I'm bent down dusting a shelf. And then out of nowhere, it sounds like somebody came up to the left side of me and goes, seven right in my ear. Now this is so loud, I actually jumped up. I was kneeling down at the shelf and I jumped straight up, stood, looked around, thought, okay, somebody just snuck up on me. And it was a fairly small all night gas station, so there wasn't a lot of room to hide. So walked all around the store, didn't see anybody. None of the door chimes had gone off to let me know that anybody had come in or gone out. It was just very strange. That's the only time in my life that's ever happened that I've heard a disembodied voice call my name. And like I said, it was so loud, it actually made me physically jump up. Now, I will say to this, I do suffer from audio pareidola. For those of you that don't know, my brain will tune into white noise and tries to make it sound coherent sound. Though sometimes it'll sound like music, music where you just can't quite catch the lyrics. Sometimes it'll sound like muffled conversation, but never has it ever been clearly audible and sounded just like my name. Now, I will say that at the time I was working in this gas station, there was no piped in music. There was nothing particularly loud. Just me in the quiet. Anyways, Derek, just thought I would share. Have a great day.",

But, you know, I can think of a few worse things that can happen to someone at a late night gas station, But I can't think of too many things that would be creepier than what seven just detailed. For me, it's not so much the disembodied voice, although that in itself is unsettling. It's the proximity that voice had to our witness. Now, he just mentioned this on Tuesday's show, but for that voice to be right in your ear like that, that means that whoever or whatever is saying it has got to be right next to you. And the weird part about it is these witnesses don't even realize it until that entity speaks up. And that's the part that makes my skin crawl. And unfortunately for you, seven, you know this experience firsthand. And we appreciate you sharing those details here with us. Now, folks, let's shift gears here a bit. This next entry details one of those unidentified flying objects, the description of which we don't hear about all that often. So please welcome Mary out of the state of Virginia.",

      "text": "Hello, Derek. My name is Mary and I'm calling from Virginia. However, even though I'm calling from Virginia, my story actually takes place in Massachusetts. The South Shore. That's the area between Boston and the Cape. And this took place in the 90s. I was a teenager at the time, like an older teenager. I was in a car with my dad and my stepmother. And it was about dusk, and we were driving to my mom's place where my dad was gonna drop me off. Suddenly my dad's like, what's that? I see something in the sky. I look out the window and I think it's like a low flying aircraft. At first, however, my dad's kind of spooked. And the thing is, my dad is not an easy to spook type of guy. He has, like, a background in science, so he is very skeptical about these things. But it scared him enough that he pulled over, he got out of the car, and my stepmother can see it because she's, like, sitting next to him. And I'm in the back. I can't quite see it. She's like, tommy, please don't go. Don't go out there and look. My dad was just like, I want to know what that is. So he got out of the car and he starts staring up at the sky. I can't get a really good look at it. So I get out. My stepmother is protesting, but I want to see what my dad's looking at. As I get out, I see. At first, like I said, I thought it was an aircraft, but it was not a plane. It couldn't have been a plane. It was hexagon shaped and it was very big. And I could see kind of some lights blinking, which is why I thought it was a plane at first. But I knew it definitely wasn't a plane because of how low it was flying and how big it was. And also, there was this, like, vent on the back of it that had this pulsing glow that was coming from it, like it was magma or something like that. Something just slowly glowing, like switching from glowing red to glowing orange and back again. That really frightened me. But I couldn't stop staring at it because I really wanted to figure out what it was. And my dad was just kind of frozen in disbelief himself. And we just watched it, and it kind of hovered over us for a little bit before it headed on. We couldn't hear anything. Then we saw it just kind of disappear below the tree line. So we got in and my dad didn't mention it. He didn't talk about it. He never mentioned it again. And my stepmother started to, but my dad cut her off and we just kind of drove on. I always still think about that UFO to this day. I could never tell you what it is, and I still think about it. My dad never mentioned it. My dad passed in 2016 and I kind of wish I asked him about it if he ever figured out what it was. But I think since he couldn't explain it and figure it out, he preferred just to kind of ignore it. But I'm kind of the opposite. I kind of wanted to know more about it. There is a redux to this story. Like a part two. I was just visiting with my brother over the weekend and I was telling him about this because I'd never told him about this UFO story before. And he grew white when I told it to him. And he said, that's very strange that you tell this story. And I was like, why? And he's like a friend of mine, this older guy, he owned like an independently owned store down the harbor. And apparently this older guy said that he believed in UFOs. He had seen three UFOs in the same area from the time he was a child until he was an adult. And he saw it three times and it was always near the beach. Where we were was kind of near the beach. It wasn't quite on the beach, but it was near the beach. And he had said that it was hexagon shaped and that kind of, you know, it leans credence to my story. It kind of made me feel like, oh, so what I saw was maybe not that unusual after all. I'd be curious to hear if there's anybody else that had UFO sightings, especially hexagon shaped UFOs in the South Shore area of Massachusetts. I did look in Project Blue Book, the stuff that was released, and I saw reference to a UFO in my hometown where I saw this UFO in the 60s. I can't remember if I recalled it being hexagon shaped or not, but it was at the beach. And I always, when my brother mentioned it, I was wondering if that was the same one that this older gentleman shopkeeper had mentioned. Anyways, love the podcast. Have a good day.",

      "text": "Thank you, Mary, for calling in. Well, you know, we might have something for you here. The following encounter was reported to the National UFO Reporting center and occurred in Haverhill, Massachusetts, which is only about 38 miles as the UFO flies from where the experience in Mary's story occurred. Here is that report. It was a clear night. The UFO appeared straight overhead. It moved across the sky at about two times the speed of a jet. The UFO was a hexagon. It was about 50ft off the ground. It flew right over us. My grandfather and I were sitting there talking, and we heard a swishing sound. I looked up and told him to look, and we saw a thin hexagon, two times the size of an airplane, fly across the sky at an amazing pace. It had flashing lights that changed colors. The colors on it were unexplainable, and I never saw them before. Then it disappeared, and we never saw it again. Per usual, you can find a link to everything mentioned in tonight's show by visiting our website and clicking the Show Notes tab at Monsters Among Us podcast dot com. Now, truth be told, that encounter that I just read occurred In June of 2009, decades after Mary's encounter. But given the description and the location, I figured it was close enough. Close enough to prove something strange might be going on in the skies above Massachusetts. So thank you again, Mary, for leaving us your story and putting us on the path of discovery. Now, folks, grab your scuba gear, because we're venturing into the splash zone. Please welcome Maria, out of the Sunshine State.",

      "text": "Hi, my name is Maria, and I'm calling from central Florida. But this story actually belongs to my father, and it takes place in the country of Nicaragua. My father was about 12 years old, so this would have been around 1956. So it was a very long time ago. This occurred on a farm in Nicaragua that belonged to his family. So a lot of what would happen is when school would get out and they would go on vacation, a lot of, you know, my father's cousins, their parents would send them to his aunt's farm to go work and kind of spend vacation. And they would go and they'd do a lot of stuff on the farm. And on this one such day, he went out with a wagon and a mule. And one of the workers on the farm, who was an older gentleman, probably in his late 40s, and my father was 12 at the time. And they went out to the property. His aunt actually happened to own quite a large amount of land. And right next to the farm is a large, inactive volcano that has a lagoon inside in the middle. It's actually called Apoyeke. And they actually happen to own half of that volcano. And so they used that very fertile land to plant things. And they also used it for their cattle to graze, which is one of the main things that they had on the farm and on this day they took the wagon, they had to go up the side of the mountain up to the very top. I've actually visited it myself. Once you get to the very top, you can kind of look down you and you see a large lagoon in the middle, just like a lake, you know, very beautiful. So my father on that day, I would say was around the afternoon, early afternoon, there was still plenty of light and they were cutting plantains up there at the very top. And my father says that him and his companion saw a craft emerge from the water and kind of hover very quietly. It made absolutely no sound from what my father says. He said it was kind of cigar shaped and it kind of came out of the water, kind of hovered above, you know, almost at the top of the crater a little bit, and then just went right back down and went back in the water. And I think at the time, I don't Even know if UFOs were even a thing that people talked about, especially in a Latin American country in the 50s. They would have had a very limited amount of, you know, technology news. So my father is actually a very educated man. He's very well read, and he says to this day he's not found any kind of aircraft and books that would resemble what he saw. He says the closest thing in terms of behavior would be like a stealth aircraft. It kind of hovers quietly, doesn't really make a lot of sound. He says that's the closest thing in terms of behavior. But in terms of look, cigar shaped, all metal, no real markings, nothing to really identify where it was from. Several years later, I would say around the 70s, he did have a conversation with some military people from Nicaragua who he shared the story with. And they happened to mention that they had several other military people, you know, witness that sort of thing in and around the area, in some parts of Nicaragua. So they're not exactly sure. I'm not sure if it's some kind of like advanced aircraft that existed at the time, maybe belonging to the United States. Maybe they were concealing it, be looking for some rural areas to conceal it. I'm not sure that's entirely possible. I just know that him and his companion both witnessed that. And to this day, my father is not really sure what kind of craft that was. Thank you and keep up the good work. I really love your podcast and I'm glad I have a place to share all these crazy stories. Bye.",

The waters in and near the legendary Bermuda Triangle, the world's deepest lake, Lake Baikal in Russia, Lake Michigan here in the US The Gulf of Mexico, the Sea of Japan, the Black Sea, and most notably, perhaps the waters off the coast of Southern California, specifically around Catalina island, all the way up to the Santa Barbara area. But in reality, these things are seen all over. And if I didn't know any better, I'd say that Maria's father saw one as well. And as Maria alluded to, the fact that it took place all the way back in 1956 is certainly noteworthy. So amazing stuff.

I'm calling today because I heard a story where someone had reported seeing something like a translucent bat, and it was the first time I Was kind of excited about what me and my husband had seen four or five years ago. So I thought I would tell my story and see if it was at all close to the same sighting. So my husband and I were visiting my parents in Ottawa, Ontario and they live in a, you know, not a suburban area. It's like quite city esque and an older neighborhood. And we were both smokers at the time. So we went outside after dinner with our drinks and we went out in the backyard, a tiny backyard, you know, close to all the other backyards. We sat out and had a cigarette and chatted. It was around probably 10:30pm, really nice night, not cloudy, fairly clear. I didn't notice it was windy or anything, although it's been a while now, so I can't remember too many details. And as we were chatting about God knows what, I look up to my left above the horizon like beside my parents neighbor's house and I see this, what looks like a V shaped big pair of wings moving in this like kind of mechanical way, like they're flapping but they're like illuminated. I couldn't see really a body, just the wings, like the way you would like draw arches for a seagull. And I saw them and I told my husband, hey, do you see that? Like what is that? Is it a drone? And we look and he's dumbfounded and so am I. And we're just kind of looking at it. It's kind of shaky, flapping, mechanical, very high up in the sky, but not high enough where it would be like plane height, I can't gauge, maybe you know, 100ft, 150ft, I don't know. And it was moving away from us and then all of a sudden another one appeared right beside it, kind of in tandem and they were both flapping and moving away from us and we just watched them in total awe, having zero clue what it could be. It didn't look like a drone, it didn't look fully mechanical. It looked like it was, I don't know, almost like it was an animal. But also this illuminated, mechanical jerking motion. I've never seen anything like it. I've never seen anything like it again. And we both looked at each other and thought this is definitely a UFO of some kind. So I did tons of research to try and find any like Google description that might be the same. And I couldn't find anything at all that looked UFO wise like anything we had seen. And it was only when I heard that story about the kind of translucent bat sighting that I thought, oh, that's kind of really similar to, at least visually what we saw. I don't know if the motions were the same, but certainly visually sounded really similar. And when I saw the picture, I thought, okay, from far away, that's probably really similar to what we were looking at. So that's my story. I hope it's useful. Thanks again for everything. Have a great day. Bye.",

      "text": "Hi, my name is Eli. I've been a long time listener of the show, like literally since season one, but I have been recently catching back up. So I'm in season 19 and there's been a couple of stories about faceless entities and I wanted to call in my own story. So I'm from Michigan and I live downriver. The house that I lived in had I could not even count how many odd happenings, ghost sightings of everyone who visited. But the one that I'm going to talk about today is the faceless woman I would see both in dreams and when I was awake. It was always a very benign kind of experience, but it was very odd. The most notable time that I ever had anything happen, I woke up at night and I slept in the basement of my parents house. So it was always very dark and pretty cold as it was. But I woke up from a dead sleep for whatever reason and sat up and looked around trying to see if maybe the dog was making a sound or somebody had done something in the house and they didn't see anything. But when I turned to the other side of my bed, there was a woman sitting there. She had long black hair like a red dress with a white apron. And even in the moment I thought it was very odd that I could make out all these details because it was so dark. But when she turned to me, she had no face, like no facial features at all. It was just like a blank slate of where a face should be. And her whole appearance, all of it seems to glow. Like I could make out all these details despite it being very dark. And she just kind of turned and looked at me and then patted the end of the bed as if, like to tell me to go back to sleep. Like you know you would do for a kid. Like you just pat the pillow. For whatever reason I did, I just laid back down and went back to sleep and. And I would have never thought to tell this story except for a couple years later at a sleepover. All of us were telling scary stories. You know, we were watching the horror movies and telling scary stories that we had experienced or whatever. And one of my friends told the exact same story. They said they woke up one night and there was just a woman sitting on the bed. Explained her the exact same way. Long black hair, red dress, with a white apron and no face. And I thought that was so weird. So I had to tell them that. And then hearing these stories be told Both in season 18, I think, episode 47 and season 19, I don't remember what episode. I just thought it was very interesting that this was something that occurred to a lot of people. So I just wanted to go ahead and share my story. Keep up the awesome work. I hope to continue listening to your podcast for many years to come. Thanks.",

And he's right, you know, from time to time we do receive this sort of report, though I'm not sure exactly what it is being reported. Is it a perception issue? Maybe the spirit has trouble fully manifesting, which results in a blurry face? Or is it that these entities never had a face to begin with? I guess both. Possibility is unsettling in its own way. Whatever the cause of the entity's missing mug, we thank you, Eli, for telling us all about her. Now, folks, time is running out.

      "text": "Hey, Derek, I'm gonna call this in anonymously from Arizona, but this story actually happened in Idaho about five years ago. So I was near Ketchum, which is close to Sun Valley, hunting black bears and wolves with my dad, and both of us saw just a really strange animal. The best way that I can describe it was it had the body of like a Himalayan tar, which if you look up what a Himalayan tar looks like, they're like a goat almost. They got very furry body, like a muskox. They had the body of that, but it had like the head of almost a moose. Like, I've seen basically every animal that could be found in that area. I've seen mountain goats, I've seen bighorn sheep, I've seen wolves, black bears, moose, elk. This was none of those. This was something I had never seen. And initially, since we first saw it in the early morning, I thought this was just a mountain goat that looked weird because of the lighting. But as the day drove on and we continued to watch this thing, we realized this is not a mountain goat. This is something entirely different. Now, if this had happened in like say, New Mexico, I could have just thought, oh, that's just the Himalayan tar, because they do have a feral population of tar there. But this happened in the mountains of Idaho in fall. We don't have tar here. And mountain goats, to my knowledge, aren't normally brown. So I just thought I'd call that in. If anybody else from Idaho has experienced something like that and know what that could have been, I would appreciate knowing. It's confused me for years. But thank you for letting us call in and share our weird stories like this. All right, bye.",

      "text": "Thank you, caller. How's that for a mystery? Some sort of unidentified unculet. Let's break this call down a little further. For starters, I'm quick to think of the moose lady call from season 16, episode 14, a story from Eau Claire, Wisconsin that detailed a strange looking old woman carrying a suitcase that morphed into a moose like creature right before the witness's eyes. A chase later ensued. It was really quite an ordeal, and if you're not familiar, I highly recommend you track it down and give that story a listen. And there was also a similar story also out of the state of Wisconsin that seemed to describe another moose like creature thrashing on a beach on either Lake Superior, Lake Michigan, I can't recall. Now, it sounds like our caller is quite familiar with all the creatures of that area and so am I, if I'm honest. And just like our caller, I also can't think of a single mammal that should be in that area that matches that description. I searched a list of invasive species. I searched high and low for any known cryptid from the Gem State, and I didn't find a single thing that I think I could even remotely attach to the animal in our color story. And that's where the trail went cold for me until my editor, Connor, suggested a call from last season that just might detail the exact same creature. Now, this story originally aired on season 19, episode 18. How many of you remember this entry from Dee in the state of Idaho?",

After we graduated, he went into the military and he got stationed up in Alaska. And what he would do whenever they weren't doing anything on the base is he would go with some of his friends on base, and they'd find places off base to go, you know, fishing or hiking or just generally exploring. So they were doing this one day. And what he described to me is he saw what he thought was a moose in a bunch of willows. And when this thing walked out of the willows, it was something with the body of a moose, but it had the face of, like, a person almost. But it didn't look like a person. Its face was all, like, distorted. It looked burned almost. And on top of that, it had the antlers of a caribou. Now, I've never heard of any sort of cryptid or native legend that is like this, so I truthfully have no idea what this thing could be. But I feel like it is just a really strange story from one of my buddies that I had never heard because I had just recently talked to him since he moved down here after the military. Okay, bye.",

I was recently listening to the season 7 episode 19, grab bag episode fairly far behind, but it describes A disembodied hand. And it kind of brought up a memory that I had pushed away for a while because it pretty much Fs with my reality, if that makes sense. So I was in the car with two of my siblings, my younger brother and my younger sister, and I was driving them home from youth group. So this would have been probably eight or nine at night, pretty dark. And we were just driving down the highway and we were about to get on the exit ramp and I saw something in my headlights just in the middle of the exit ramp, very low to the ground. I couldn't quite make it out until we got up close to it. But as we got up close to it, I could see that it was a disembodied hand. And I had zero idea what I was looking at. I was completely dumbfounded. And I slow down and we literally have to wait for this thing to cross as it just walks in front of us across the exit ramp and into the ditch. And I mean, as you can imagine, my siblings and I just completely freaked out. We were just like, what in the hell was that? Was that a hand? We were just completely freaked out. We had no idea what was going on and we just drove away as if nothing happened. We never really brought it up to our parents or anything because, I mean, it's just the most ridiculous story you can imagine. So, yeah, that's my story. Thanks. Bye.",

What I'm getting at is that there shouldn't be any severed hands in the middle of the road. I guess it might happen from time to time, but it's not something anyone should expect to run across.
