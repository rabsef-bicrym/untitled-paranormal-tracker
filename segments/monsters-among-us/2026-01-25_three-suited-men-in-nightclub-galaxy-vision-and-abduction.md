[Speaker C] I want to remain anonymous, and here's my story. I had been newly engaged to a young man, and he took me to a dealership to look for a car. And the family that owned the dealership was extremely wealthy. I noticed that the gentleman, the young gentleman who's probably like, May 2930, couldn't take his eyes off of me. It made me feel very uncomfortable. Okay, I was engaged. A couple weeks later, I'm in this club with my girlfriend, didn't drink. And there's two levels. I'm on the second level, and I see these three men come in dressed in Suits. They had, like, a glow about them. And they seemed to be doting on this one person. And somehow in my mind, I knew that was the man I had seen at the dealership. So I ignored it. And I'm standing there, and all of a sudden I felt this burning charge go through my back, like from head to toe. And I turned around and I saw this vision of a giant galaxy out in outer space. Now, this was pre Hubble, and I had never imagined or seen anything like this or didn't know anything about outer space aliens, nothing. And I became so frightened. I just became shuddering. And this man came to me and he said, did you see what happened when I looked at you? And I said, what was that? And he said, that's the galaxy I come from. And there was two other gentlemen with him. And the one gentleman had started reading my mind and talking about a friend I had who was a professor. He said, I know your friend, the professor, from this small town in Peru. And he literally named the town. And I'm freaking out. So after that, I was like, you know, I don't know what to do. Like, I'm so scared. I'm so scared. I just kept shuddering. I told him, yes, I'll call you. I'll call you. Even though I was engaged, but I had no intention. And the following weeks, I was so frightened to go back to my apartment because I just felt like somebody was watching me. And I kept saying to myself, it's in the sky, it's in the sky, it's in the sky. Then after that, there was this cascade of years of bizarre experience. Let's fast forward now. I talked to somebody who is famous. I'll leave him nameless, who was an alien hunter, and he was with the CIA. And I spoke to him about everything and told him everything that happened to me subsequently. Like losing a pregnancy, an embryo, disappearing in my body after I got married. You know, these other bizarre goings on. And he confirmed everything I had gone through. And then, miraculously, strangely, the email address I had for 10 years was wiped out of the site. And I kept going in. They said, no email such as this exists. My correspondence with this alien hunter just completely disappeared off the map. And it was extremely freaky. And I just knew that everything I had gone through was real. And it's frightening beyond any imagination you could have in this world. And totally true. I am sane. I have never been treated for mental illness. I have no medical conditions. This really, really happened. Okay, another part of this alien piece later in time. I Found out, like, I was maybe six weeks pregnant, and in a couple of nights, I found myself waking up, and it was not a dream. There's a difference between a dream and an experience. This was an experience. And I was in absolute agony. And I opened my eyes and these people in surgical garb were around me, but they were not people. They had these giant, black, shiny eyes. They look Asian. And I was like, stop, please, no, you're hurting me. And I looked down and I saw this black oozing liquid all over my abdomen. And it's funny, because years later, I saw the Travis Walton movie, and he described some black Uzi stuff, and that was what was all over. And this is before that movie came out. And when I looked at this one creature with the surgical cap, he gave me the most evil look, like he was enjoying hurting me. And it was horrible. So, anyway, lo and behold, a couple of days later, I go to get ultrasound, and they tell me that there's no baby there. There's no evidence of a placenta. There's no nothing. Everything's gone. And I'm not pregnant. It's completely gone. And the doctor was baffled by this. And within a day, I got the worst abdominal infection with 104 fever, where he said, if you don't get well over the weekend with this antibiotic, go the emergency room immediately. So whatever went on, I'm telling you, they took my fetus. There was no evidence of it. That was one of many experiences. Well, thank you for listening. I appreciate it.
