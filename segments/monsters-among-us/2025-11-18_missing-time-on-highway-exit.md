[Speaker B] So this is Gabrielle from Pennsylvania. I just have the weirdest thing happen to me, and that's why I'm calling right now. So I work at a school district, and it's about 20 minutes away from my house. Every single day, I have to commute home, and I typically take the highway just because it's a little faster compared to taking all the back roads. But today, when I was driving home, I always get off on this specific exit. It's exit 77. But exit 80 is also an exit I can take to get home, but it's a little further up, so it's easier for me to take 77, be able to get off the road. There's less, like, detouring, less traffic I have to deal with. But today, as I was driving home, I somehow completely missed my exit. I'm not actually sure what happened, because one point I was driving down the road, and it was a little bit before my exit. And then all of a sudden, I'm a lot further down the road, noticing that the mile marker is reading, like, 77.5, which means I completely missed my exit. I just took the Exit 80 to get home, but I don't remember at first seeing exit 77 as I was driving home. So not sure if that's a little bit of a time thing. I wasn't paying attention to my clock, so I can't unfortunately say if I'm missing time or anything. Where it's glitch in the matrix, I'm not sure, but I missed my exit. Thankfully, it doesn't take me much to get back home. So that's the good news. I have more stories to tell. But again, thank you guys for the podcast so much. Have a nice day. Bye.
