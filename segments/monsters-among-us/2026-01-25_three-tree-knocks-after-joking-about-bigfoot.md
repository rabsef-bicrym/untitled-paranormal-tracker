[Speaker B] Hello everyone. This is Tess calling from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Again. I just subscribed to Patreon and I've been binge listening for a couple days now, so I just wanted to share this with you guys. When was this? Probably like two, three years ago. I decided that I wanted to go take a walk in the woods by my father's house, so I took a couple books. I Took my binder and I was definitely smoking the devil's lettuce. So I took some of that as whenever I'm in the woods by myself, I try to make jokes just because I do get a little jumpy if no one else is there with me. So I remember sitting there at the homemade fire pit all the teenagers would go to at night, and I'm reading my book and I'm smoking and me going off on a tantrum. I just said out loud, like, hey, if there's a Bigfoot in these woods, just know that I'm a friend. I believe in you. I don't have any beef jerky, but, like, I. I'll give you a hug. And I kept repeating this because I didn't have any beef jerky. I do believe in Bigfoot, and I was just trying to be a little silly. So then after I'm done, like, messing around and saying all this stuff, I go back to reading my book. Not even five minutes later, I heard three tree knocks. Now, by. By all means, I do not believe there's a Bigfoot living in the woods by my dad's house. The woods are just way too small for such a huge creature. Like, we have deer and fox and coyotes, but, like, no bears. That doesn't mean that I did not get scared. I packed my bags as fast as possible, dumped out the water, and I just booked it out of the woods. I didn't think it was a Bigfoot, but the thought of someone listening to my conversation and being that close to me to mess with of me scared me more than a Bigfoot would. I hope you guys enjoy that fun little story because I look back to it and I still laugh my ass off, even though how scared I got. Alrighty. Thank you guys. Enjoy the rest of your day. Bye.
