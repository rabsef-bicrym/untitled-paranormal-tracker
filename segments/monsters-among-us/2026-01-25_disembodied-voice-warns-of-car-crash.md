[Speaker B] Hey, this is Casey from Louisiana. I actually had a weird experience last night. Always listen to your podcast as a drive around. I'm a delivery driver. Last night I was actually coming home from my niece's band concert. Clear night, kind of cold, had my oldest niece in the car. She's 21. We were stopped at a red light and no musical, nothing like that. There was actually a police car stopped in that had pulled someone over in a parking lot just to the right of us. And as we were talking I heard some heard a voice sounded like it came over the loudspeaker from the cop. And as soon as that happened, I started looking around, seeing why not even a couple seconds later, in front of us, a car ran into the back of another car. It was really weird. And actually asked my niece right after, hey, did you hear something right before that crash? And she's like, no, I didn't hear anything. And I swear I thought it was a cell phone maybe going off. Neither one of our cell phones had gone off. She didn't hear it. So I'm pretty sure it wasn't the cop cop car that was not far from us because she was actually closer to it than I am or was so pretty sure it wasn't that. And yeah, it was just really weird. It was like I was on alert right before the crash happened and tonight actually driving working again and was pulling up to someone's house and my GPS told me to turn right and I turned right, turned into the driveway. Right after it went off I heard right again. My GPS doesn't actually say it twice. If anything it would have said you've reached your destination. But I heard right right after my GPS set it kind of freaked me out because it is dark already. I drive all the time by myself. Again, it's another clear cold night. It's just really weird. I've never had anything like quite like that happen to me. Had quite a few other things happen. But I'll come back another time. Thanks.
