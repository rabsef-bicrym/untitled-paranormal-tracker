[Speaker D] Hey Derek, My name is John. This story comes from when I was living up Pennsylvania. I'd say it was 2017 and it was hunting season, late November, early December. I was hunting at a farm that my father in law and I used to go to. And this morning I was just going by myself. I was off of work in the middle of the week, but I decided to go hunting out there. So I went out to the Grego farm out in Pennsylvania and I went down to a tree stand spot that I'd picked out earlier in the season. I say I roughly got there about 5:00 in the morning, got up into my tree stand and I was just sitting there facing the open cornfield. And behind me was a very large sinkhole they used to refer to as the quarry. And there was a small stream that used to run back behind there. But while I was sitting there, I used to know the pretty normal sounds that went on around that farm. I've been there a couple times, so it was just like any other normal morning. And then for some reason I was up in my stand and all of a sudden I got a sense that something else was there. I didn't know exactly what it was and everything seemed to get dead quiet. Then I got hit in the face with this odor and it kind of smelled like a wet animal, wet dog, something of that nature. And the hairs on the back of my neck stood up and I was, for the first time in a long time, I was really scared and I felt that something was looking at me. I didn't look to see what it was. I didn't want to. In the back of my mind it was saying, you don't want to see it, you don't want it to see you see it. I sat there in the stand for a few minutes and then finally seemed a sense of whatever was there went away. I don't know what it was, I didn't see it. But that's my story. What was it? I don't know. But it was so real to me that as soon as day broke I got down out of the stand. I didn't even sit around to wait to go hunting. And I just got back in my truck and I went home. Thank you. Have a good day and thank your staff.
