[Speaker E] Hey, this is B. I actually messaged you some time ago about recording and sending you something for better quality. But some stuff happened in my life. Things have been busy. The point is I was listening to this previous week's episode with a friend of mine who used to date me, but we're still really good friends. And there was a part where we just kind of both stopped talking and she just stared at me wide eyed. And this woman was telling a story about seeing a creature, you know, scampering through a graveyard. And at first I didn't really put it together, but been listening for a while but talking to. And I realized when she started talking about the night terrors, like why this girl was so surprised and looking at me the way that she was when I was 13 years old, ish, 13 or 14. I was dating like my first girlfriend at the time and our families were good friends. So sometimes she comes stay the night and stay in my sister's room over the weekend because they lived about 45 minutes away. We were standing by the window one night and I lived near the Adirondack Mountains in New York. And we were just looking out and I can't remember which one of us saw it first, but we both saw it. There's something in the corner of the yard now I had a massive yard, you know, it's literally almost the size of a football field. So it was kind of far away at first, you know, then it came to the edge of the tall grass where the short grass was trimmed down, which was a lot closer to the the house. We, we didn't see it move, but suddenly it was kind of just there. But we had been talking, we thought it was an albino deer. They happened. So this thing runs across the perimeter of the short grass in the yard, in the long grass so fast and it kind of Seemed to be going in and out of the grass. And it occurs to me now, and I mean, I'm not sure if it ever did before, that it could have been going down on all fours to run, but it was certainly standing at one point. Anyway, this freaked me out. To date, it's the scariest thing I've ever seen in my life. Just the way the thing moved seemed unnatural. It didn't make sense to my eyes. I, growing up in the mountains, encountered a lot of animals in the woods. Bears, bobcats, everything you think of. Coy dogs, wolves. All those things I understood. You know, they're. They're wild animals. Their behaviors are somewhat easy to predict. Most will run away from you. This felt wrong to look at. It was strange. But what really got my attention was when she started talking about night terrors. Because one of the first things that I told this girl when we started dating is like, listen, sometimes I wake up very excited or freaked out. And when I was younger, and it started not too long after I saw this thing, and I never really put the two together, and I'm still not sure that they belong together, but here I am calling you. They. I started having these. These horrible, horrible dreams about. And it's the same dream almost every time, but the people in it change. I wake up in the dream. I start my day. Someone that I love dies. I wake up again. I think that I'm awake. I think, what a bad dream. Start the day. Someone else that I love dies. Or sometimes it's the same person over and over again. It's not consistent in that way, but it is consistent in that this like a time loop, like some weird Groundhog Day sort of situation. And by the time I actually wake up, I'm so disoriented and freaked out that I. I kind of really don't know where I am for a couple seconds. I think we all know that feeling. Waking up and just being like. It feels like you're not even in your own room, but you are. This lasts a little longer with this. But at some point I started talking to some people and I kind of worked out a way to, like, just not really black out my dreams because I still have them, I'm sure, but.

[Speaker C] I don't really remember them distinctly.

[Speaker E] And I still have him from time to time. And it's weird that she should mention the bad luck thing too, because I have had an interesting life, I can assure you. But those details aren't for public consumption, though. Anyway, I know this isn't a long story, but that. That freaked me out. I had planned on calling in with this story. Like I said, derek, I sent you a message some time ago saying I wanted to record it. And I planned on calling in this story. I'd even told this girl about that, and she told me right there, she's like, you have to call it in now. And I'm not a big believer in the paranormal stuff. It's fascinating to me, but I usually have to have some sort of empirical evidence before I make my mind up on anything. That being said, the phenomenon is interesting to listen to. That's part of the reason I like this show is because I get the stories straight from people's mouths. And. Which makes it a lot easier for me to judge on whether or not I find the stories to be credible. Because there are stories that have been called in here where I've just gone, nope. But back to this creature thing. I, too, kind of became obsessed with it when I was younger. And I, you know, I knew what skinwalkers were because they're Native Americans, near where I grew up, the Akwesasne tribe. I know it's not an Akwesasne legend, but as far as I know. But, you know, people. Kids talk. They make up stories, you know. So the skinwalkers thing had come up when I was younger, and I never really associated it with that. I never really knew what it was. I thought maybe I'd seen some sort of cat that was. Had mange or something, that they could just stand up tall like some bobcats and cougars can kind of come up on their hind legs. For a minute, I thought it had been a trick of the mind or that's what I kept telling myself. But, you know, I. I talked to the girl who saw it with me in later years, and she said it had always messed with her, too. I do not know if she had nightmares. I didn't speak to her about anything like that. I don't really talk about the nightmare stuff with many people. It's kind of weird. But the point is, I've never ever heard anyone else say this story. And I was in St. Lawrence county and must have been 1998, 99. I think it was after the last large ice storm of the 90s that I saw it. So. So it may have been the summer of 98, but this is up, I mean, a stone's throw from, you know, Ottawa or just a couple hours from Montreal. It's very, very far north in New York. So, I mean, I'm thousands of miles away from Colorado and you know, hundreds or maybe not thousands, but hundreds of miles away from Colorado and Illinois were the other two people who had seen this thing. Had, had seen them. So I am now redisturbed by the entire situation. I kind of, you know, hadn't really relived it too often. But yeah, it's kind of ironic that that girl at the beginning of the recording was hoping she would hear more because that's the same reason I was gonna call in because this is a thing that I've not found any documentation for. So if any of the listeners have heard something like please, by all means post them to the Monsters Among Us page or something like that, I'm not gonna give out my personal email. No offense, but yeah, I didn't give out my name either, so. All right, well, thank you very much, Derek. Keep up the good work with your show. I know it's fun. You must have a blast listening to these. Anyway, have a nice night. And lady, from now in Colorado, if you have any, ever have any more details, please post them to the page because this thing has been in my head my entire life. So thank you.
