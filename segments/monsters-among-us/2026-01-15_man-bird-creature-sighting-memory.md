[Speaker E] Hi, my name is Ayla and I'm from Brownsville, Texas. I was just watching a pretty popular TikTok account where they tell scary stories. And this girl was saying a story from South Texas, talking about a large bird, possibly even a pterodactyl, but it was like human like that they saw in their barn. They didn't say what city, but they said south Texas. And it reminded me that I have this memory from when I was young. This would have been in the early 90s, so there was no Internet back then. But I have this memory that I was watching the news with my parents and there was this like huge bird that was the size of a man and it looked like a man. Like the body and everything looked 100% like a man, but it had feathers and everything like a bird and it had a face like a bird. And so it was a bird, but also looked like a man. I want to say it was either at the flea market or downtown, you know, an area that's very populated. And I want to say that there was even a photo of this thing that was either on the news or in the newspaper. And they were just saying that they had no idea what it was. And I want to even say this man bird thing, like a bluish color. But I had that memory. And whenever I've asked my parents about it, they have no idea what I'm talking about. And whenever I google it, I don't find anything about that. So I've, you know, just given up on that and thought, well, maybe it was just like a dream. But I don't know why it's like a strong memory if it's just a dream. I mean, we are on the border of Mexico and there's, you know, the legend of the lechrusas, the witches that turn into the owls, but this is not an owl. Didn't look like an owl at all. It did also remind me of you. Not long ago played a story, and I want to say South Texas, but they didn't specify where exactly. And they said that they saw this huge bird that looks like an owl. I want to say they said it even had like an owl face, but the body of a woman and that the woman looked like she was wearing like the scuba outfit or whatever, the neoprene, you know, but white. I thought that was interesting. Who knows, maybe somebody has a story similar or same memory. Maybe it wasn't a memory. Anyway, thanks for listening and hope we can get some answers soon.
