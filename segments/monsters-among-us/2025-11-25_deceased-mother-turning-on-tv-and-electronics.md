[Speaker H] My name's Joe and I've got some stuff that's been going on at the house. I don't know if it's connected but about a year before I stopped over the road driving, I lost my brother to a bad staph infection. He was living down in Dallas at the time and back home in Oklahoma now. We grew up in a house that I'm currently living in. And he had moved down to Dallas. Mom moved down there with him to be with him. He had had some surgery done, and he had died from a really bad staph infection that was caught too late. And then just later that summer, say about six months later, I lost my mom. And about that time is when I came home, you know, pretty much for good. I started to notice some things around the house. My wife had always told me she's sensitive, and she's noticed that we've had a little trickster spirit, I guess you could say, that's been playing around in the house some. But the thing that's really been spooking me is that about three months after my mom passed, and my mom's always. She's always hated dogs, you know, And I'm totally the opposite. Love dogs. They're like our fur kids. And I don't know if this is her stirring stuff up. I really don't want to say it is, but I sometimes Wonder. But about 2:30, and it's not all the time. It's like maybe once or twice a week, about 2:30 in the morning to about 3, I wake up because the dogs are going nuts, and they're always facing toward the living room. And I'll start walking around and making sure everything's okay. And every time I walk in to the living room, the TV is on and we've shut it off. It's smart TV that, you know, when it comes time to get ready to go to bed, we always set the timer so that way if we doze off, it'll shut off and, you know, we'll notice that and we'll drag our rear ends to bed. But it always seems like if there's a little too much stress going on, I don't know if that could be it or doing it. But, you know, the TV will come on, even the computer monitor will come on. And we've got that in the living room as well. And they're on two separate electrical circuit, so I know it's not a power surge doing it. And my oldest son, he lives with us still. We both work at the same place and he's noticed it as well. It's always when the dogs just go completely nuts, like somebody's wandering around. So don't know if it's mom still aggravating the dogs because she don't like them, it's always weird. It's just one of those weird things. And we've had two different TVs in living room since I've been home. And there's always something turning it on. So I don't know, sometimes it'll be on full volume. Other times it's just on and quiet, like it's muted. So I don't know if that's mom still doing that or if it's that little trickster. But we've got a little friend there. And sometimes we do catch the little ghost. It's a little girl. Sometimes I still see that little girl out of the corner of my eye in her little outfit. She's got like a little blue jumper on, a white blouse, kind of sandy blondish hair. And we've been in that house since 1980. So I don't know anything of the history prior anybody has lost a child there. But I do notice that since mom passed, she stays in the hallway. She won't come out of the hallway because she used to run. You know, we'd catch her different various places of the house. But since mom passed, she's not coming out. So I don't know. That's just one of those creepy things. I had been talking to a friend about it and he popped the question. Especially as you're dealing with my wife being sensitive. And if she's caught any of this. And I have asked her, and she has, but she's of that train of thought that you don't cleanse your own home. You have another sensitive come in to do it. It's some kind of belief that she has from growing up because apparently there's a line of this and her family. But she said she would do it if they ended up harming any of our animals or any of us. But there's nothing. It's just like playing tricks on us and such. So that's just kind of what's been going on. And I kind of wonder if anybody else has got something like this going. So really love the show. Appreciate everything you do for us out here. And it really makes the day or evening, whenever I'm working, to go by quicker. Keep up the great work. Bye.
