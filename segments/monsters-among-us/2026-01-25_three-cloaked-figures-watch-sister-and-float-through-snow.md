[Speaker H] Hello, I first want to thank Zhanglist Podcast for sending me in your direction. I have two stories about the mirrored men. I thought I was just seeing things, but now it makes sense. They both take place in the Chicagoland area. The first story is actually from my sister. This was at least a decade ago. She was sleeping in her room. She's directly above mine and it was about 1am when she suddenly woke up. She said that at the edge of her bed were these three figures all just sitting there watching her. She described them as being like monks, probably just meaning they were cloaked. Anyway, she said they sat there watching her for five minutes and they turned all together and slowly walked down the hall into my other sister's room. My other sister hasn't said anything about seeing anything. My mom and other siblings, they just told her she was dreaming. My second story happened on Thanksgiving Day like seven years ago at my aunt's house. I was babysitting my cousin who was less than a year old. Everyone older than 21 had gone out drinking and my siblings were driving home from my mom's. My job was easy. The TV and computer were in the room next to the baby and the baby was sleeping for the night. But the kitchen was up a few stairs. It snowed a lot that November so only the patio in the backyard was shoveled. So I went to the kitchen for soda or water or whatever and I looked out the window and didn't really see anything since it was like 11pm and the light out there was motion sensored. So I go back to the room with the TV and computer. And I see through the blinds that the light went on. So I looked and almost maybe 15ft away, I see these three shadowy figures and they seemed to notice me looking because they. They turned in. In my direction and where their eyes should have been was blank and their mouths were faster than their faces when it came to turning. I did the good old fashioned, you know, rubbing, rubbing the ice thing, but it didn't go away. I guess they thought I was a threat because they turned back in the direction they were heading and kept walking. The weird thing was that they almost floated above the snow. There were no footprints and they literally went through the gate, which was a thick wooden gate. This was the first time I mentioned it to anybody because I didn't think it was real. Anyway, I love your podcast and thank you for helping others like me feel like our stories are real.
