[Speaker C] Hi, this is Mimi. The story is from central Illinois. I used to be a resident of central Illinois, and it would have taken place during the early 2000s. I grew up in a parsonage, which, for anyone who does not know what that is, that is the home provided by a church to a ministerial family where the pastor and their family will live. Typically, the only people who will have ever lived in a parsonage would be a pastor's family for that specific church. Well, my story in regards to that house isn't too, too significant. It was just when I was in middle school, maybe around, like, 12 years, I had been watching TV, and during the. You know how sometimes they have, like, a little blackout period between commercials if it just couldn't be cut correctly? It was like that. And in the screen, I saw a very tall black shadow walk through the archway that reflects off of the tv. And I was completely home alone. So naturally, you know, being 12, that is more than enough to freak me out. I felt like I was being watched. I, like, felt frozen in my little spot. It's been maybe 18 years since that happened. However, the real story is a year after that, we had moved to Southern Illinois, and the pastor who took over for my father, she had moved into the same house, the same parsonage. Well, she called us after we had moved about a year later, and she said, how do I get these kids at the church to stop messing with me? And my dad was like, what are you talking about? We never had any issues with pranksters or anything like that. Nothing whatsoever. Not at all. So much so that we would often leave the doors unlocked. What she had said is that she had been hearing people running up and down the hall in this little house when she was home alone. She lived by herself. Not married, no kids. She even came home once after service to the kitchen faucet on and all of the kitchen dining room tables on top of the dining room table. So all the chairs on the table and the faucet on. That is definitely a classic, spooky story. But the most compelling part was that she was very anti all of that. She didn't believe in any of that stuff. So she was certainly convinced after that. But that's the last I ever heard of that story. So whoever's living there now, I hope they're having a pleasant experience. Thank you very much. Monsters Among Us podcast for your awesome stories. This is like a classical storytelling format, which is so cool. As a former professional storyteller myself.
