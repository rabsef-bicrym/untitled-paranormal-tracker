[Speaker C] Hi, Derek, this is Jamel from Houston with another story. I remember around this time I was going through some things and I was very, very depressed, pretty sad. So one day I was playing PlayStation and I was going to go in the kitchen and fix me some cereal. So I go to the cabinet, pull out a cereal bowl. As I'm getting ready to pour the cereal on the bowl, I felt something charged me from running. Like kind of like how you would feel like a football player or someone running to tackle you. So I instantly turned around and of course no one was there. But you know, you have tile in what I do in the kitchen. So definitely felt the footprints of someone running towards me, getting ready to tackle me. But of course, like I said, soon I turned out no one was there. I haven't had anything happen since then. So I think by me being depressed and sad, I kind of maybe brought that on myself because like I said, I haven't had anything happen before that or after that. So I think maybe that's what happened to me. But anyway, that's my call. Love the show and keep doing what you're doing. Thank you.
