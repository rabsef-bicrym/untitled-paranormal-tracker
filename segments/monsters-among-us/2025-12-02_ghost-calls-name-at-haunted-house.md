[Speaker C] Hey, Derek, my name is Luis. I'm calling in from Farmington, New Mexico. Just wanted to tell you a story about what happened to me last summer. We were on vacation in Cancun. Flew from Cancun to our friends of ours hometown. It's called Nonuva, Chihuahua, Mexico. So it's an old little town, been around for a long time. So what happened to me was we pulled up to our friends aunt's house, which is old house, you know, and we unloaded everything they sent us to go get drinks. It was broad daylight. We went to the store, got drinks, whatever. We came back, we pulled over, whatever. We were getting stuff out. I was in the passenger seat. I got out and I was starting to get the drinks out, and I heard somebody call my name. They were like, hey, wait. And I thought it was my friend that was driving. I thought he was the one calling me. Well, I thought it was weird, right? So I grabbed the drink and then he walks around, gets out of the driver's seat, and I'm like, hey, dude, like, did you call my name? And he just looks at me like, no, I'm. Are you sure? You go, yeah. Why? I was like, because I just heard somebody call my name. Okay, whatever. We walked inside. So, you know, I just kind of just sitting there thinking about it. I told his mother in law the hell. Just the weirdest thing that's happened to me. She's like, what happened? I just heard somebody call my name, like outside. And she's like, go, show me where. So I went and showed her where it happened and she just like got kind of like, hey. She's like, they said that there's a lady that is seen walking through here at night, like a ghost lady, you know? And I'm like, for real? She's like, yeah, that's crazy. So I had a ghost call my name. And that was kind of freaky. One side of that house is, you know, I guess haunted because they hear things. They see that lady walking through the side of the street window. You know, they hear stuff moving around at night. So kind of creepy. Thought it was a cool story I would like to share, but thanks, man.
