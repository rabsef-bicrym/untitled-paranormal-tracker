[Speaker B] Hey, Derek, it's Jose from California. I've been listening to the podcast for probably about a week now, and I've just fallen in love with it. I love hearing everybody's stories, and I decided it was time for me to share a story of mine. So this story was a rake sighting or encounter. This happened back when I was 13 years old. I vividly remember I was about to go to sleep. For some reason, I was going to sleep earlier than usual. I usually go to sleep pretty late, you know, and especially in middle school. I just never, you know, never felt tired or anything, you know, and for some reason, it was time for me to go to bed. You know, I told myself, hey, I'm gonna go to sleep early. And I was brushing my teeth, and in my bathroom, I have a little mirror that you could see the entryway into my room from that little mirror. And, you know, usually when I brush my teeth, I feel like it's a pretty normal thing for people to do, to just brush your teeth and stare at yourself in the mirror. And I was doing this, and I vividly remember, you know, bending down to spit out the toothpaste in my mouth. And the second I went back up and looked at myself in the mirror, I saw something in the corner of the mirror, which was the main entrance into my room, and what it looked like. I honestly, I was very surprised at first when I seen it because it looked like a person. It looked like. The best way I could describe it is like a naked mole rat. Like, very pale, no hair, very hairless. I just want to stress that, like, literally no hair. And it seemed like it was like an old man, very wrinkly, and it seemed to be on all fours, very, very skinny. And what surprised me after this, looking back at it and thinking about it after it happened, was the area that it was in. It made no sense as to how it could be there because it was kind of like lower, like, parallel to the floor, as if they were, like on all fours, you know, on its knuckles, just standing up. And it kind of peaked its head around the door. Except I Had a pretty large bed frame at that time, and it was literally right up against the wall where that. That person, or I would call it the Rake now, where it was. And it just didn't make sense to me as to how it could be there. And I just remember dropping my toothbrush, leaving the water on, leaving the lights on, everything, and just running to my mom's room and explaining to her what I had saw. And of course, you know, she didn't believe me. And my sister was there, too. They were watching the movie and they just thought I was crazy. And I was just terrified. The next day, I did not go into my room. I had my little sister go in there for me and grabbing my clothes, and I was just terrified to sleep in there for, like, weeks straight flash forward, you know, to like, you know, a couple years from there, going into high school, probably like a year, year and a half later. I had always been interested in, like, the paranormal and just ghosts and all that crazy stuff, you know, And I had really got into YouTube stories and the cryptids, and that's when I learned about Creature called the Rake, which, you know, when I saw it, there would be pictures or drawings of it. And immediately, as soon as I saw it, I got reminded of this incident. And, you know, it described it as, you know, like a humanoid figure with no hair, very pale, very long, lengthy arms, and all these different stories. And there was one story that stood out to me that said that a woman had encountered the Rake, and it said that it would be back. And I thank God I didn't hear anything from the ray, who didn't speak to me. But one thing that stood out to me was when these people were telling their stories, multiple people said that it means one or two things. Either you will die or somebody, you know will die. And this stuck with me because the years following that incident, I had family members that would pass away, and I just, you know, couldn't help myself but to think, was this something that the Rake was doing? Thankfully, you know, nothing has happened ever since then. I haven't seen it since then, and I'm very glad that I haven't. I just want to say, you know, I love the podcast. Keep up the good work. I have plenty of stories to tell, so who knows, maybe this would be the first of many. But thank you.
