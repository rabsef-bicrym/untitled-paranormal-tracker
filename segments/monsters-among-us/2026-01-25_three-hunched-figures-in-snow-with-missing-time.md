[Speaker C] Hey Derek, I've been listening to your podcast out of order and I happened across one that flooded me with anxiety and recollection. When I was about 14 years old, back in 98, I saw three hunched figures which terrified me. There was something alien about their movements and about how little definition their forms had. It was late winter with iced over snow on the ground, everything extremely well lit with a nearly full moon and reflective white snow covering everything. It was after midnight, around 1:30 or 2:00am and I felt wrong off somehow. I looked out the window and saw three dark silhouettes walking single file over the snow, slowly, almost lazily moving through the night. I watched them trying to figure out who or what would be moving so strangely in the dead of night in freezing cold weather, miles from civilization. I lived 30 miles from the nearest small town, 50 miles away from the nearest thing you could call a city, middle of nowhere, Iowa. This looked like the shadows of hunchbacked old crones, but maybe they were holding themselves that way against the cold. It took me a while to realize all three of them were perfectly mirroring their movements. The single file line sort of made sense. If you're walking in the snow with others, it saves effort to walk through their wake, trodden in their footprints, but the synchronicity was uncanny and once I noticed it it was disturbing. It just felt wrong. And I became scared. And just about the moment I was starting to feel real unease and fear, they stopped and they turned their heads to point in my general direction, like they heard something or caught a scent. I'm not ashamed to admit I squealed for my dad to come quick. These things weren't headed for my house, but they weren't far from it either. They seemed to be cutting across my backyard and again, let me stress how odd it was to see somebody, anybody at all, near my house. It was very, very isolated. I would have probably shouted for my father sooner had I not been taken with curiosity at the slow movement, the oddness of these things. I shouted again, desperate now and very afraid. My father showed up at my door. But the odd thing was, he looked like he'd just woken up, but he was in the middle of a movie. The last thing I knew, I had somehow, somewhere, lost about three or four hours. It was 5am and he'd been asleep while apparently I was staring blankly out the window for hours. My bed was still made. I hadn't been asleep yet and forgotten about it. I begged my dad to come outside with me and look for tracks telling him of the weird people I'd seen in the yard, and eventually, reluctantly, he agreed. We got dressed for outside and went out onto the porch. My dad asked me if I'd been outside anytime recently, and I said no. Then I noticed the snow on the porch and my snowy boots beside the door to the outside. I swore to him I hadn't been outside. I wasn't big on the outdoors and would rather stay Inside with my PlayStation on snowy days off rather than go out and face the elements. I put my boots on and rolled up inside were my cold, wet socks. I would never leave my boots that way, but there they were. We went outside, but the only tracks in the backyard were from my own boots. It looked as if I had walked up to where I had seen the silhouettes, judging from their tracks, paced back and forth a bit, then returned back inside. I don't think my father ever really believed me about the missing time, writing it off as sleepwalking. But I've never done that before or since. Listening to the last caller on your third episode just sounded too similar to my own experience with the synchronized shadows and time loss. If you put my story on, I would like to suggest that if your listeners ever see three dark shapes moving in an eerily perfect sync, that they don't stare too long because somehow, somehow they notice. If you have any more questions or anything like that, just feel free to get in touch. Thank you.
