[Speaker D] Hi, this is Patty from Toledo, Ohio. I was actually just listening to the show season 8, episode 11 and you mentioned the forest fires and if someone could summon some rain and it reminded me of something that happened to me and my sister some years ago. Probably been at least 10 years if not more. We were in Mexico visiting family in the state of Durango. And at the time, they had been.

[Speaker C] Going through a drought.

[Speaker D] I think had been like a year.

[Speaker C] Maybe over a year.

[Speaker D] And growing up, we would always drive down there and stay a while. And it seems like every time we.

[Speaker C] Went, we would bring the rain with us.

[Speaker D] It would be a drought. You know, we'd get there, and within a couple days of us arriving, it would rain for a week or something. And, like, we always just brought the rain.

[Speaker C] On this occasion, you know, there was.

[Speaker D] A drought, and me and my sister.

[Speaker C] Were like, well, there's no rain to bring. Because here, back home at the time.

[Speaker D] Actually, it had been fairly dry. So we were, I guess, just being silly and remembered a. I guess a chance that was in a movie, the Secret garden, in the 90s. In the movie, this little boy is trying to summon his father. He's away, and he wants his father to return home.

[Speaker C] So these kids go out on this.

[Speaker D] Beach or whatever and say some little chant, and his dad ends up coming home anyways. This little chant, for whatever reason, kind of always stuck with us. We watched that movie a lot, but we remembered, and we were like, oh, let's try it. We just changed, you know, a couple of words. Instead of, you know, it being the dad, you know, we make it the rain.

[Speaker C] And we did this.

[Speaker D] We're walking down some little street, I.

[Speaker C] Think we were walking to, like, one.

[Speaker D] Of my aunt's houses or something. And we're just doing this chance, and that was that. Later that day, or maybe even the next day, my sister and I decided.

[Speaker C] To go take a nap.

[Speaker D] So we went to lay down, and we were sharing a bedroom, and there was two beds next to each other with a little nightstand in between.

[Speaker C] And we take our nap.

[Speaker D] And I've always had these weird experiences growing up. But I was sleeping, and my sister woke me up because I was crying in my sleep. And I had been dreaming, I guess, that there was some old woman that.

[Speaker C] I somehow knew really wasn't an old woman, but it looked like an old.

[Speaker D] Woman was trying to hurt my sister. We were somewhere, and I just see this old witch lady, whatever, trying to attack my sister.

[Speaker C] And I'm trying to help her, and I can't.

[Speaker D] And that's what makes me start crying in the dream. And my sister hears me, and she.

[Speaker C] Wakes me up, and I'm like, I'm.

[Speaker D] So glad that was just a dream.

[Speaker C] I'm so glad you're okay.

[Speaker D] And, you know, since I was crying.

[Speaker C] She knows that I'VE always had these weird dreams. Growing up, she asked me what it was and I told her that, you know, some old woman was trying to hurt her and she just got really wide eyed and said that she had just been having a nightmare about some old witch who was standing over the bed trying to hurt her.

[Speaker D] I've never experienced anything like that, where.

[Speaker C] Someone sees what I saw, what I.

[Speaker D] Dreamt, whatever you want to call it.

[Speaker C] I've often wondered if maybe they're out of body experiences. And I don't know it. I don't know how to control it. I don't know how to. It just happened.

[Speaker D] So it really weirded me out, you.

[Speaker C] Know, both of us. It weirded us both out that we both saw the same thing. It was really trippy. Within a couple of days of this experience that we had, it started raining and it actually rained the rest of the time that we were there. I mean, it was just a movie. Sure.

[Speaker D] It wasn't a real chant, but I guess when you believe in something or.

[Speaker C] If you give it enough belief, maybe that gives it power. I don't know.

[Speaker D] I was raised Catholic.

[Speaker C] I don't practice it.

[Speaker D] I consider myself to be more spiritual.

[Speaker C] Than religious, whatever that means.

[Speaker D] But I do believe in like the power of prayer. Because essentially prayers are like, chan.

[Speaker C] Maybe we did that. I don't know. Maybe we tapped into something that we weren't supposed to that this witch showed up. I don't know. It was trippy.

[Speaker D] It was a weird experience.

[Speaker C] Did we summon the rain? Did we really summon rain? Like that's just. I don't know.

[Speaker D] It was weird. Anyways, that's my story and thanks for your time.
