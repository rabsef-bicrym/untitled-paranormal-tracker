[Speaker C] And monsters among us, family and friends. My name is Dawn. Supernatural, no phenomenon. It follows me and my one friend, like, amplify each other. So we went to go ghost hunting at a cemetery, which was up in Wisconsin. We'd been there a couple times, but one time our friend Paul actually had his name call, which we picked up as an edp. But I think it was like a third time. We had gone up there. It was just me, Carol, and we were getting out of the car. As soon as I got out of the car, I smelled burning flesh. That's the only way I can say it.

[Speaker B] And I started panicking a little bit, and I'm like, do you smell that?

[Speaker C] Asking them. And I'm like, you don't smell that? No. Get in the car. Get in the car. We got back in the car and we're going. When we stopped, what is the. I'm like, oh, my God. It smelled like heart flesh. It was so bad.

[Speaker B] But, yeah, me and Carol, like, if.

[Speaker C] There'S a ghost to be had somewhere, if we go or any kind of, like, loop or anything, we will find it. I don't know why.

[Speaker B] Thank you for everything you do, for.

[Speaker C] Allowing people to talk and tell their strange stories that are, you know, their experiences.

[Speaker B] And thank you very much because you have made being on dialysis so much better.

[Speaker C] I listen to you guys all the time while I'm there. Thank you.
