[Speaker E] Hey, Derek. This is Chuck calling from Tucson, Arizona. This story takes place in the early fall of 2016. I used to live a good bit west of town, on the southwestern border of the Saguaro National Monument, down a road called San Joaquin, off a street called Kai Anasasi. One night around one or two in the morning, I got up to use the restroom. And while standing there, I heard five knocks on the bathroom door, very loud and very distinct. Assuming it was the girlfriend I was living with at the time, needing to get into the bathroom. And being a half asleep myself, I said come in if you need to. And after no response, I said are you there? And after a second moment of no response, I went to the door, opened it and my girlfriend was waking up on the bed asking what that knocking sound was. Never found an explanation for that. It was just one of the weirdest things that have ever happened to me. A few days later I was sitting at a table alone in the house and a tupperware bowl slipped off the table as if someone hit the lip of the bowl going off the table. No explanation, but anyways, figured I'd call my wife and I love the show and spend many date nights out in the desert listening to MAU Keep up to go to work man. Thanks.
