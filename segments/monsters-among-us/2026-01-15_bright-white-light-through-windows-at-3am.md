[Speaker G] Hi Derek, longtime listener, first time submitter. I got a strange one for you. Not really explainable and I'm not quite sure how to classify it. It was probably 2019, August or September. I was working a sunrise shift, so I would wake up at 3am to get ready for work and to set it up. I would walk out of my bedroom and I would turn right down a hallway and go straight to my kitchen. My kitchen has one window on the left and one window straight ahead. So I wake up like usual, three in the morning. I walk into my kitchen, all my lights are off and this bright white light, like I'm talking, it felt like someone was holding a flashlight up to my face. How bright it was moves from below up through my windows. Both the one to my left and the one straight ahead lit up like my entire kitchen area. And I could never quite explain it because the window to my left faces directly to my neighbor and the one straight ahead, it's got a horizontal street going across and then there's a church. So there's no car coming in any direction. There's no way that someone's high beams are coming through my window. Somehow the one thing I recently thought it could have been was maybe a spotlight from a helicopter. But I didn't hear a helicopter. I didn't hear anything. And I'm sure if it was a Helicopter with a spotlight. There would have been something in the news about looking for somebody or something or other. Right after this happened I flicked on my lights. I was kind of shocked because, you know, had a bright light that felt like it was shined directly into my eyes. Looked out my window and you know, streets are pretty empty around three in the morning. Of course my neighbors weren't awake obviously and definitely not shining lights. This was on kind of an elevated floor, second floor anyway. So there's no way that anyone could have shown a light through my window. Just something I couldn't quite explain. Never have been able to really think of a proper explanation. It didn't help that that same night I was having very strange dreams involving aliens and stuff. I'm not suggesting any abductions or that it was aliens, but it was a strange set of dreams followed by a strange circumstance. There was no way for me to even confirm anything about being abducted. I usually sleep in the nude so I couldn't check if my pajamas were on backwards or something. Anyways, just a really strange occurrence. Never been able to explain it and it's always kind of stuck in the back of my head and just something I always remember. Anyway, thanks, bye.
