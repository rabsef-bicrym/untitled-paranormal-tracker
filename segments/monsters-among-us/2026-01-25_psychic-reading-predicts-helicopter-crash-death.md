[Speaker C] Hey, Derek. Hey, my name is Ty and I've just kind of a newbie to your podcast and listening a couple of months. It's about my friend Sandy. Sandy has cerebral palsy but is very independent, works and has a, has a daughter. So she does very well for herself. And if you're not familiar with cerebral palsy, it's usually some, there's been some damage to the brain so that usually their motor skills are affected like speech, you know, walking, sitting, things like that. But anyway, as I said, Sandy does very well for herself. What's also amazing about Sandy is that she's also psychic and she reads tarot cards and I'm trying to unpack this so that it's not too confusing. So let me kind of backtrack. I grew up in Southern California, graduated high school in 1984. And I had a friend of mine, a good friend of mine who also. I graduated high school in 1984, his name was Richard Anglin. He graduated 84. He was one of the coolest guys. I had him in a wood shop, had some other classes, cool guy, just everybody liked him, easy going, whatever. Anyway, this is 1984. Lost track of him, as often happens when people leave High School five years later, like 1989, I'm reading a newspaper, local newspaper, and I see in the paper a story about a helicopter that had crashed somewhere overseas. I believe it was like somewhere in Central or South America, but there's an American helicopter at the base that had crashed There was like 16 crew members on Things Are Like Marines and other personnel. About 16 people. It had caught on fire crash, and it sadly killed all people on board. They had a list of all the people that were killed. And one of the names on there was my friend Richard England, or at least I thought it was. It said Richard England and gave the age. And I always wondered if that was him. Obviously, I'd lost contact with him, didn't know anybody else who knew him, but I always wondered if that was him. Now, then Fast forward to 1993. That's when my friend Sandy moves in the way that meant Sandy was. Sandy moved right next door to my mom, who had a condo. So they became friends first. And then when I would go visit my mother, I also became friends with Sandy, who me and my mother both loved. So again, just through briefly talking, Sandy told me that she did tarot cards. If I wanted a reading, she'd be happy to do it. And I was very grateful. At the time, I hadn't done any from her, but I was very grateful and kept that in mind. Okay, so now fast forward to probably about 1999. I'm still back in my hometown visiting. And another childhood friend of mine was having a birthday party. So I'm at his house, celebrate his birthday with him and his mom and his dad, some other people, bunch of other people. While I'm at his birthday party, I happened to meet a woman. Her name is Pat Anglin. And because it's such an uncommon name, I just had to ask. And I asked her. I told her who I was and who my friend was. And I said, listen, I said, I just have to know. I said, I had a friend named Richard Anglin. And before I could finish, she cut me off and said, yes, that was my son. He did die in a helicopter crash. United. And I said, I thought so. I said, I always wondered, but I couldn't prove it. But I saw the news article. I'm so sorry. So sorry. So gave my condolences. We really talked for a while. She then tells me that what some added information, she says, you know, she says, before that happened, she says, I have a friend who reads tarot cards. And she had warned me of the danger.

[Speaker F] And I said.

[Speaker C] I said, oh, really? Who was it? Well, as luck would have it, it was Sandy. She knew Sandy before I did, as they had worked at the YMCA years ago, like in the late 70s and early 80s. So she tells me this story that a couple weeks before it happened, she's at Sandy's House. And Sandy wanted to read her tarot cards and she says, okay. And she gets out the card, Sandy, Sandy reads the cards and she stops for a second and has a terrified look in her face. And Pat, the mother says, what's wrong? And Sandy says, listen, seen in the car, she says, I hear yelling, I see fire, I see death. And I guess knowing that her son was in the military, she asked Pat, she says, you know, I see your son's gonna go on some, on some maneuvers in a couple of weeks. Can you get him to postpone it and not go? And mom says, well, you know, I don't know, I can try, but I can't guarantee it, but I will try. So I guess she goes home, tells her son, doesn't tell Rich exactly how she finds this out, but just says, you know, look honey, I have a bad feeling. Can you just not go on this, on this particular exercise? And of course, you know, Rich being Rich, great guy, just said, oh, mom, don't worry. You know, mom, you worry too much. I'll be fine. And of course ultimately does go on the maneuvers and ultimately, as I mentioned, dies in this helicopter crash. And as I mentioned earlier, I was so sad to hear that. But I guess in a weird way I got at least some kind of confirmation that at least it was my friend Rich who had indeed sadly died in the hello, Coffee crash. That's the end of the story.
