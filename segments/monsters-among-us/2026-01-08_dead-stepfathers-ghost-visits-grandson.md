[Speaker C] Hi, Derek. My name is Victoria. I'm in South Georgia. I guess this was back in about 2017. My son was about 4 years old, and I was getting him ready for school, and we were in the bathroom, he was getting a bath, and he looks at me and he says, mama, who's that man over by the sink? And I look over and I said, son, there's not a man there. And he says, yes, mama, there is. And I said, well, what's he look like? And he says, well, he has long hair, glasses, wearing a white dress and sandals. And I was like, a little spooked out. So I was like, oh, okay, well, go get dressed. So I wrap him up in a towel, we go to a whole nother room, and I'm getting him ready, and he looks at me and he says, mama. I said, yes, son. He says, that man? I said, yeah, what about him? And he says, he followed us. He's behind you. And I'm like, oh, okay. Well, let's go to school. Finished getting him ready, and I put him in the car and we go on to school. Well, later that day, I called my mother and I said, mama, Damon saw a man in the bathroom today. And she says, I wonder if he saw Jimmy, which is my stepdad, who actually passed away in that house from cancer. I was like, I don't know. And she said, well, I'm gonna send you a picture and you show it to him when he gets home. And I said, okay. So I showed him the picture and he started crying and he says, mama, Mama, that's the man. That's the man. And I was like, oh, well, that's just Papa Jimmy, you know. And he actually passed away before I found out I was pregnant with my son. So my son actually never knew him. A couple days later, he comes running out of his bedroom. I'm in the kitchen cooking, and he says, mama, that man. He's back in my room. And I was like, okay. So I walked in there and I said, listen, I know that you're just checking on him, but you're scared of my son. Would you please leave? And he's never come back again. I have one more story. It's actually another ghost story in the same house that I was living at the time that happened with my son. My husband worked night shift at the local chicken plant and would leave about 1 o' clock in the morning. And about an hour or two later, I would have my bedroom door shut. And of course I'd have all my children with me because I'm a scaredy at night. I don't like being alone. And so I'd have all of my babies with me. And so I closed my door and we would sleep with the door shut. Well, about two, three o' clock in the morning, my bedroom door would slam open and hit the wall and my bed would start shaking. And this happened almost every night. And I'd wake up scared, sit up straight, look around, see if I could see anything. And I wouldn't see nothing. So I'd lay down and I'd try to go back to sleep. But first it took me a while to go back to sleep, but then I got used to the door slamming of the bed shaking, and I just go back to sleep. That's my story. I love your podcast. Thank you.
