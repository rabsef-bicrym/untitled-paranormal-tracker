[Speaker B] Hi Derek, My name is Ashley and I'm from Picksburg Trail. Although this first story that I have to share happened in a very small town in western Pennsylvania named Dunbar. Very, very small town. Anyway, when I was five years old, I with my mother a lot in bed at night because I was, you know, just so little and I loved being with my mom all the time. And one night sh was really, really in a deep sleep. And I was woken up by our front door jiggling. And it kind of threw me off for a minute. I was so little that when the first time that it happened, I kind of just brushed it off and I didn't wake up my mom. But then the next night, I was woken up by the same thing. The front door of our home.

[Speaker C] I could hear jiggling.

[Speaker B] Now, you may wonder how I could hear our front door being jiggled from the bedroom. It was a very tiny home, so I absolutely could hear our front door from my mom's bedroom. So the second time it happened, heard the jiggle, jiggle, jiggle, and woke my mom off. And I said, mommy, I hear the door jiggling. And she kind of brushed it off and just said, oh, you know, it's probably a dream or just probably, you know, your imagination. And I was like, okay, you know, when your parents says that, you definitely think they're right. So I just went back to sleep. Following night, heard the door jiggling again, woke my mom up right away. And this time my mom got up to check. Nothing there. A few nights later. You know that feeling you can get when you feel like someone's staring at you? I can get it now, even as an adult, but as a kid, I could still tell someone's looking at you. Or if you have eyes on you, get this certain feeling. Well, I woke up out of sleep thinking and feeling someone's looking at me. Woke up and saw a very tall, lean man bent down over top of me, staring directly in my face. And I was frozen in fear. Couldn't move, couldn't speak, couldn't do anything. The only thing I could do was close my eyes so tightly because, again, I was five years old, possibly going on sick back in the late 80s. So at that time, I just didn't know what else to do except shut my eyes. I shut my eyes for a few seconds, opened them back up, and he was gone. To this day, I don't know who it was. And I remember the next morning because I did eventually fall back to sleep. I woke up and told my mom. They were so freaked out. And when I talk about it to this day, I still get extremely scared. It's like, who was that? Why were they hovering over me? Why were they looking down at me? And my mom always says, you know, that my story has never changed. As a kid, when I would tell it, it would just be the exact same. That's the first creepy encounter I had. Okay, thank you Bye bye.
