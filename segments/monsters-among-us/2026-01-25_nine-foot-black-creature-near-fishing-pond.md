[Speaker D] Hi, I am going to just call myself Kay. I just had in the last 30 minutes the weirdest experience of my life. I guess. I use my town's walking trail, which is constructed from an old railway, as often as I possibly can, and I walk or run about three miles every single morning. I got here a little later today because we had rain this morning and it's just starting to clear out. So it's a little overcast, but it's bright. You can walk around without not being able to see and it not being dark or cloudy or raining or obstructing my view or anything like that. And okay, so this trail, if you turn right, a large, large creek that connects to a couple of state parks, weaves in and out from underneath the walkway. But if you turn left, there is a basically sport fishing pond and cornfields and not really too many people or anything.

[Speaker C] So.

[Speaker D] So this morning I took a left and went past the great big pond, turned back, was coming back towards the parking lot for my car and a gentleman is coming towards me and he's got a great big golden retriever on a leash and he and I are about 5ft apart and his dog is just absolutely losing its mind trying to get down the little pathway off of the trail to get down to the pond that stuck the fish. And he and I both looked over and at the base of this tree this big black thing goes from it was like squatted in a little ball and I honestly didn't notice until it stood up and it stood up and it takes off towards the direction I'm in. So say I'm facing 12 o'. Clock, it goes from 10 o' clock back to 7 o', clock, and it vanishes into the trees. I am 5 7, and this thing is down a little incline from me. And it probably came up to my chest, so it had to have been like 9ft tall. I don't know. And the man and I both flipped at each other while his dog is now whimpering. And I go, did you see that? And he immediately turns around so that he can head towards the parking lot too. And he says, we didn't see anything. At which point he and I both take off running back to our cars. And I'm trying to talk to him about what we have just seen. And I'm asking him, did, what was it? What did you see? What did you see? And he picks up his golden retriever, pops the trunk like the hatchback of his car, and he goes, we didn't see anything. Go home. So now I've just gotten home and it's all catching up that I think we might have just seen a bigfoot. I guess I feel crazy even just saying that out loud, but like I said, it was often a little, like, slope down to this pond. I'm not a short girl. I'm five seven. It was probably about my chest height when it stood up. It was furry, it was black. I should mention I live in west central Indiana. We have a couple state parks, but we don't have bears. We don't have big cats. We have like, little bobcats and maybe coyotes. And this was not that. I worked as a vet tech. I know the animals in this area. I know what they look like. We have cows. It's a rural, slightly wooded area in parts, but it's mostly farmland. I have no other explanation for this. Thank you.
