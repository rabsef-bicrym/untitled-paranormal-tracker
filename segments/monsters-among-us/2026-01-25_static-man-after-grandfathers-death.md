[Speaker B] About 23 years ago. I was very young, about 5 or 6, when my grandfather died. And it was my first real experience with death. A day or so after he passed, I woke up late at night because I had to use the bathroom. And it must have been about 2.

[Speaker C] Or 3 in the morning because everyone.

[Speaker B] Else in my house was asleep. I walked into the bathroom, closed the door behind me and did my business. And when I opened the door again, I saw a static man in the doorway. I mean, that's the best way I can describe it.

[Speaker C] It was literally a man shaped static blob and it lingered for a few.

[Speaker B] Seconds before kind of dissolving into the air. And I was so scared. But I ran past the place where that static man had just been and I ran straight to my parents room and told them what I saw. And my mom has always been very religious, so she believed me right away.

[Speaker C] And thought that I had seen my recently deceased grandfather.

[Speaker B] And she kind of calmed me down and got me back to sleep.

[Speaker C] But for a while after that encounter.

[Speaker B] I was too afraid to use the bathroom so much that I actually peed myself at school one day because I.

[Speaker C] Was just too scared to go by myself.

[Speaker B] And I'm not sure like what I saw that day if it was my grandfather. I've never heard of a ghost that was static before, but I'd love to hear what you think. I mean, it's possible that maybe the recent passing of my grandfather just influenced my imagination and got the better of me that night. But anyways, thank you for listening to my story. I love your podcast and thanks watching for for all of your hard work. Bye.
