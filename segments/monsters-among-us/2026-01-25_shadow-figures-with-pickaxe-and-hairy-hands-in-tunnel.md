[Speaker B] Hi Derek, my name is Mike and I live in Pennsylvania. Just recently discovered the podcast and I'm already becoming a big fan. I just wanted to share my story. It happened in our area about 1996 or 97. We had always heard stories about local haunted areas in our city and during that summer we had nothing better to do. We decided to take up the mantle of amateur ghost hunters and to start going around late at night to various sites in the hope of finding something. One of the places we had gone to was a local landmark. There's a tunnel that Passes underneath it. And we had heard lots of stories about people saying they had heard voices in the tunnel. They had seen things. If you drive through and honk your horn three times, you'll see a ghost. Different things like that. So we all piled into the car. And probably around midnight, we got outside the tunnel. And there was a lot of nervous energy. And we're goofing around. And one of the things we had decided is if we ever did see something, instead of talking about it, we would write down what we saw. So that way no one could influence somebody else. Say, you know, well, I saw this, and then everyone else. Oh, yeah, I saw that too. So we kept a piece of paper with us, and we were talking. And then suddenly everybody got really quiet and very still. And after a few minutes, we walked away from the tunnel and we all gathered back in the car and everybody wrote something down on the paper. Two guys lingered behind and then joined us about another minute later. And then they wrote down. And when we got back to our friend's apartment, everybody had written down the same thing. A black silhouette in the darkness of the tunnel with a pickaxe working. And we were all just very excited, except the two guys who lingered behind wrote an additional detail that they saw another black figure seemingly come out of the wall and turn towards them. And they said they had yellow eyes. And they both wrote the same thing as well. So we were very excited that this happened. Everybody, you know, we couldn't stop talking about it. And the next night we decided to go back up again in hopes of seeing something again. And when we got there, one of the people who had been there the night before, one of the ones who'd seen the figure with the yellow eyes, he was right behind us on the road. And we. He didn't get there at the same time. And we waited and we waited and we waited. And a few minutes later, he came driving up. And when he got out of the car, he was clearly very agitated, pacing around his car. And we went. We went over to see what happened. It looked like someone had taken a chainsaw through the back fender of his car. What he told us and what he swears even to this day, is that whenever we were driving up there, he felt something grab his steering wheel and pull on it and tug him towards the side of the road, which would have put him into a reservoir. And he managed to get control of his car, but he scraped up against some rocks and some things on the side of the road. And I think to this day, he still won't go back up to that tunnel, so I just wanted to share that. Hopefully it's something you can use. Enjoy the podcast and keep them coming. Thank you very much.
