[Speaker A] My name is Lumen. I'm from the state of Oregon. I currently live in Portland. But this story took place in my hometown of Jervis. It was a UFO thing, which is funny because I don't really tend to, like, believe the UFO stuff. Like, it's not something I tend to think about. It was A nice sunny day. Sun was slowly starting to set. I was in a car with my family. It was my mom, my dad, my three sisters and me. And we are heading home from some sort of event. And we're all in the family car. It's probably like 17, and we're driving and I look out the window and I see an aircraft. I typically don't believe in the UFO type things. And I'm like, oh, maybe it's a military aircraft. Because like our farm airspace was being used by military. And I was so used to seeing all the military aircraft, but it was just this weird black oblong shape that was big on one end and tapered down to something smaller. I couldn't see any wings, no flashing lights. I was really, really confused. And honestly, I had no idea what was going on. I'm like, mom, you guys see that? And they're like, oh, yeah, that's weird.

[Speaker D] It looks really weird.

[Speaker A] So I'm like, as soon as we get home, which was like, any minute now, I'm gonna hop in the gator and I'm gonna go check that out. I'm gonna take dad's binoculars. And this thing was super slow moving, super low to the ground. I could see details on it, but it didn't have any military logos. Nothing, nothing going on. And as soon as we get home down a half mile long dirt road, I hopped in the gator with the binoculars and I book. It took less than a minute as soon as I got out of that car to get to the end of the driveway. And it was such a slow moving thing that you think it'd still be there. By the time I got to the end of the driveway, it was gone, completely gone. Like it evaporated from the sky. There was no sign of it anywhere. I looked in the skyline, nowhere, and it was still light out. Like it wasn't like super dark or anything. It was still blue sky, slightly red, but other than that, I couldn't see anything. So that is my UFO story. I don't really have many of them. That was my first time seeing a ufo. My grandmother has an experience on that property with the ufo, but then again, I ain't sure. So thank you so much for your time, Derek. Have a good night. Or day, depending on where you are.
