[Speaker B] Hi Derek, My name is Monica and I'm from California. This takes place a few years ago, probably around 2016 or 17. I was working like a courier job and I was out on route one day. It was probably late spring, early summer because the weather was warm and sunny but I wasn't super hot and sweaty. I was in like a residential neighborhood and I was getting out of my car to deliver a package to a house and as I am walking up the sidewalk I hear in my right ear, something absolutely screech directly in my ear. It was so loud that it hurt my ears and kind of like almost knocked me sideways. I looked around and not only was there no other person, but there was like, not even any other cars. It was just an empty street, a normal neighborhood, middle of the day. As far as the sound goes, I would describe it as somewhere between, like tires, screeching nails on a chalkboard and a banshee shriek have absolutely no explanation for it. I am not prone to auditory hallucinations. Yeah, that's it. Hope somebody else maybe has an answer. Have a good night, Derek.
