[Speaker C] Hi, I'm calling on behalf of my friend. When I heard this story from him, my friend and I had to like really get it out of him. He was like too disturbed or upset to even tell it. But he eventually told us, we're all in our mid-30s now. But when this happened to him, he was nine years old and his brother was 11 or 12. This took place somewhere in Manitoba. They lived on a property where their backyard like went out to the forest and they had been camping in their backyard one night and they had gotten woken up by like a light. I don't know if it was a sound in combination with the light, but they came out of their tent and they had seen like a glowing light hovering. They said it wasn't too far away, maybe like 10ft away. And it was like egg shaped and it was glowing and it was kind of hovering towards them slowly. And he said the next thing they knew they were up in the air like paralyzed, being pulled towards this light. And he said he remembers looking at his brother and they were looking at each other just like terrified, unable to do anything. And they're being pulled towards this light. And the next thing he remembers, he said that they were inside the light, they were laying down, but they still couldn't move and they were looking at each other. He says he doesn't know how to explain it any other way, but they were just inside of this light. Now when him and his brother woke up the next day. They were in their bed inside their house. And they had asked their parents if they brought them in in the middle of the night. And the parents said no. So they had no recollection of how they got back in the house. But he asked his brother if he remembers all of that happening last night. And he did remember. And they were just so freaked out they wouldn't talk about it again for years. Like decades. And when my friend had told us the story, it was just to me and one of my other friends when we were hanging out one night and my other friend started to kind of like laugh and make fun of my friend for this story. And he's like, you got to be making this up. And my friend that told the story got really, really upset and was like mad that he had even told the story. But I just wanted to tell that because it's pretty freaky. And I hope you enjoy. Thank you.
