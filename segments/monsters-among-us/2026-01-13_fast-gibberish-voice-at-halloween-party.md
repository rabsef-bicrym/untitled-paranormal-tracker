[Speaker A] Hey, Derek. This is Christina from Atlanta, Georgia. I wanted to tell you about a story that happened to us. It was last year, so it was Halloween, so we didn't take our daughter trick or treating that year. We were super busy with stuff. So we went to a church Halloween party near the house. And it was outside in the parking lot. And there's also a huge cemetery to the left of it. But this parking lot was really big, too. They had rides and different things. It was probably 15 minutes until dusk in the evening. So we have been around different rides and different things to do for our daughter. And we were just standing there in this one long line. So I was just kind of tired, kind of in a dazed state. My husband and I were standing pretty close. Our daughter was in front of us. And I hear what I thought was him. I heard him say something. And at the time, I didn't catch that. It was super fast, like almost inaudible super fast. At the time, I understood what it was, and I don't remember now what it was. And I looked at him and I said, what did you say? And he said, I didn't say anything. And I said, no, you said this. And at the time, I didn't catch how fast it was. And it was right in my ear. And he said, I didn't say anything. We've been standing here for the past two minutes not saying anything. And then as soon as he said, well, what did you say that? It said? And I could not even remember what was said in my ear. It was super weird. It reminded me of the audio that you shared a few years ago. The skies in the woods. And he's recording, and it just sounds like really just gibberish. It was like that's exactly what it sounded like. Like I said, we were right next to a cemetery. Could have been an entity trying to communicate. I have no idea. It could have been just me that I was tired. I was just staring off the days. I don't know. Anyway, thought it was interesting. Thought you might want to hear about it. Talk to you later, Derek. Thanks a lot.
