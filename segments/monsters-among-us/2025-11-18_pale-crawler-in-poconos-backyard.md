[Speaker B] Hi, Derek. I just got done listening to season 19, episode 46, the Secret Story at the end with the pale crawler, and it's got me shaken, so I'm gonna remain anonymous because this is actually a story of what happened to my son. And he's 16, so he's still a minor, but I will let you know. We do live in the Poconos of Pennsylvania. We live on the end of a long dirt road up against 30,000 acres of game land. So it's a pretty isolated area, and my son just give a little background, has grown up doing civil air patrol. He's an Eagle Scout. He is very comfortable outdoors, and he knows the animals that are local to the area. He also likes to spend a lot of time in the backyard under the floodlights, up against the woods, doing things we don't let him do in the house, like wood burning or welding, stuff like that. And sometimes he'll be out there pretty late. Well, one night, he was working on a project after dark under the lights, and all of a sudden, he comes tearing into the house, goes running right past me into my husband's office. And I hear them talking, and my husband tells him it was probably just a bear or whatever. After that, he has not gone out in the backyard after dark. So one day I asked him because it was really bothering me. I'm like, well, what's going on? What'd you see? A bear? And now you're not going out at night? And he said, mom, I don't know what it was. I was working on a project, and I heard something in the bushes at the dark side of the light line. And I look, and I can kind of see an outline of something crouching in the bushes, but it was staring back at me. And wild animals don't do that. And it was too big to be a raccoon or a possum. It was too small to be a bear. It looked like it was crouching down, and wild animals don't do that. So then I took a couple steps forward, and all of a sudden it jumped up and ran off into the woods. And I said, well, maybe it was, you know, some kind of rare wild cat, a mountain lion or something. I don't even know if we have those around here. But something like that. He said it looked like it was crouching a cat. And then he said something that just gives me chills, even Telling you now, he said, but mom, it ran off on two legs. And I said, well, what do you mean, like a person? And he said, not like any person I've ever seen. The best way I can describe it is it looked like a pale, bald, tall, skinny person jumped out of the bush and just took off into the woods. And, you know, it's been on my mind. Didn't really talk to him much about it after that, but when I heard about the pale crawler, it gave me chills. Also should note, my son is of his friends, he's the skeptic. He's the one that. He'll say, oh, Bigfoot. And he'll say, oh, it's just a hunter in a ghillie suit. Or he'll say, oh, I saw eyes 8ft tall. And he'll say oh, it was an owl on a tree. So it's not like him. Like, I'm a big fan of the paranormal, but he's more of a skeptic, so it really's got me worried as a mom. Anyway, thanks for letting me call in and I'm looking forward to seeing if my story makes it to your show. Bye.
