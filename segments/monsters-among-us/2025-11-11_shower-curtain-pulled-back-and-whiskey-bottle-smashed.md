[Speaker D] Hey, Derek, this is Zach from Georgia. This time I have kind of a funny story. It happened in my house, but I wasn't there. It's my wife's story. My wife told me to call and tell it. This happened on two occasions where I believe we have a ghost in our house. I mean, I moved in this house in 2014. It was built in 2007. My wife, we got married a couple of years back and she said the first time she was at the house by herself, I was at work. It was getting close to time for me to get off of work. And my wife said she jumped in the shower. And while she was in the shower, the shower curtain pulled back all the way by itself. And she said it scared the living crap out of her. At first she thought it was me trying to scare her. Well, when she turned around, I wasn't there. She said she grabbed one of my guns and in a towel walking around the house seeing if there was anybody there. Well, doors were all locked. Nobody was in the house. She called me, asked me where I was at. I said I'm on my way home from work. Why? She told me what happened. Well, second time, the ghost in my house or spirit or whatever it is, I really don't know. Don't get a bad feeling about thing. I think it just likes to prank people because we'd be in the living room and it just slammed the door, you know, just to get in. Somebody scared. Well, the second story was my wife. Once again, she said she was in the shower. I was on my way home from work and I'm a whiskey man. And I had just bought a couple of days before a bottle of whiskey. And I put it on top of my refrigerator. And that refrigerator, you know, I put my whiskey up there plenty of times and nothing's ever happened to it. Well, it was a brand new bottle of whiskey. And my wife said she was in the shower once again and she heard a loud crash so of course scared the crap out of her. She decided she was going to get out of the shower and go look around once again. She said she had my pistol walking around the house, doors were locked, whatnot. She walked into the kitchen and saw that my whiskey was broke in, laid out all over the floor and she took a picture of it and sent it to me. It says your ghost apparently don't like your whiskey. And of course I got home and I could smell it and I pretty much told the ghost and said all right, you had your fun and games, but if you touch my whiskey you're no longer allowed in my house. And ever since then he never touched my whiskey and every time I bottle bottle of whiskey it sits right there on top of the refrigerator and doesn't get knocked off or anything. So there's two little fun stories that I figured I'd give you. Love your podcast. Have a good one.
