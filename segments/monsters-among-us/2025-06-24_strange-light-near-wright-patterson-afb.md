[Speaker E] Hi, Derek, this is Tommy from western Ohio, just north of Dayton, Ohio. And my story takes place on Friday, September 15, 2023. I drive about 45 to 50 minutes from the Indiana state line to my office in Dayton, Ohio. And I drive this three to four times a week. And on Friday, the 15th of September, I was driving from west to east as the sun was rising about 7:15 in the morning. And as I near the Dayton metro area, which is home to Wright Patterson Air Force Base, I looked up into the eastern sky and saw a light that I'd never seen before. But like many of the calls that you have, I really thought that it was an aircraft, either at the Dayton International Airport or something from Wright Patterson. So I watched this light as it hovered in the same place. And my mind automatically gravitated to, this is an aircraft coming from east to west right at me. The light is in the same place. It seemed normal, but the light was brighter than usual. So I watched it for about 15 seconds as I neared the Brookville, Ohio, exit. Coming east, looking into a bright blue sky, no clouds. All of a sudden, after about 30 to 45 seconds, the light trails off to the north and fades, kind of like a shooting star would fade across the night sky. Seemed odd to me, but I just kind of discredit it as I'm driving along. I go about five or six miles further, the light fades back into view, reappearing in exactly the same location. This seems really odd to me. So I watch it's hovering there. By this time, I'm near the Dayton International Airport. So this is still further into the eastern skyline, maybe 15 degrees off the horizon with the bright blue sky in the back and the sun rising about 20 after 7 in the morning. At this point, the object hovers there for a while and darts off to the north once again. And as it darts, it fades out of you, almost like it was being cloaked in some way. And now I'm really intrigued because I've never seen anything like this paranormal in my life or extraterrestrial or unidentified. And after about another three or four miles, I'm nearing the Interstate I75 and I70 interchange, still looking off toward the right. Patterson area toward the east, the same thing happens. The same object falls back into view again for about 10 seconds and then finally fades out. Odd story. I've never seen it before. Could I discredit it as some sort of flare? Was it some sort of aircraft test from Wright Patterson? Was it something to do with many of the stories reported in UFO lore about the Wright Patterson Air Force Base. I thought this was an interesting encounter that you could use for your show. I appreciate everything you do. I can't wait to hear what you think this is and what this anomaly or phenomenon might be. Thanks, Derek.

[Speaker B] Thanks, Tommy. Now, at first, I thought you fell victim to the planet Venus, a planet that's fooled me more than once. But Venus does not just shoot off into the sky. That's not how any of that works. But given the proximity to Wright Patterson Air Force Base, the base that legend says was where the Roswell crash debris was taken to, and home to infamous Hangar 18, a place some UFO researchers claim still houses recovered craft and the bodies of the occupants. So if you're going to see something weird in the sky, seeing it over Wright Pat makes perfect sense. And speaking of government interference, this next one just might be an example of that. Please welcome JP to tonight's program.
