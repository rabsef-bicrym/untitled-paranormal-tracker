[Speaker D] Hi, my name is Eli. I've been a long time listener of the show, like literally since season one. But I have been recently catching back up. So I'm in season 19 and there's been a couple of stories about faceless entities and I wanted to call in my own story. So I'm from Michigan and I live downriver. The house that I lived in had I could not even count how many odd happenings, ghost sightings of everyone who visited. But the one that I'm going to talk about today is the faceless woman I would see both in dreams and when I was awake. It was always a very benign kind of experience, but it was very odd. The most notable time that I ever had anything happen, I woke up at night and I slept in the basement of my parents house. So it was always very dark and pretty cold. As it was. But I woke up from a dead sleep for whatever reason, and sat up and looked around, trying to see if maybe the dog was making a sound or somebody had done something in the house and they didn't see anything. But when I turned to the other side of my bed, there was a woman sitting there. She had long black hair, like a red dress with a white apron. And even in the moment, I thought it was very odd that I could make out all these details because it was so dark. But when she turned to me, she had no face, like, no facial features at all. It was just like a blank slate of where a face should be. And her whole appearance, all of it seems to glow. Like I could make out all these details despite it being very dark. And she just kind of turned and looked at me and then patted the end of the bed as if like to tell me, go back to sleep. Like, you know, you would do for a kid. Like, you just pat the pillow. For whatever reason I did, I just laid back down and went back to sleep. And I would have never thought to tell this story, except for a couple years later at a sleepover, all of us were telling scary stories. You know, we were watching the horror movies and telling scary stories that we had experienced or whatever. And one of my friends told the exact same story. They said they woke up one night and there was just a woman sitting on the bed. Explained her the exact same way. Long, long black hair, red dress, with a white apron and no face. And I thought that was so weird. So I had to tell them that. And then hearing these stories be told Both in season 18, I think, episode 47 and season 19, I don't remember what episode. I just thought it was very interesting that this was something that occurred to a lot of people. So I just wanted to go ahead and share my story. Keep up the awesome work. I hope to continue listening to your podcast for many years to come. Thanks.
