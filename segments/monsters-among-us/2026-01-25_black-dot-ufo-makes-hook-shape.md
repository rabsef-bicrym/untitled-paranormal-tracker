[Speaker B] Hey, Derek, this is Nico in Arizona. I just wanted to call in a ufo. I was up in the Mount Baldy wilderness area near the towns of Alpine and Greer. And it was near the west fork of the Lower Colorado River. It was a really sunny day and I was looking up in the middle of the day. Not very many clouds in the sky at all, only like a couple and they were very small and wispy. So I was like, I was lying down in this patch of grass and I was looking up and over the tree line comes this black dot and it makes this almost like hook shape right above me. It's large enough where I can make it out without losing it, like when looking directly at it. And then so I watched it, I was like, oh, that's a neat little aircraft or whatever. And then when it completed this little like hook shape, almost like a little curve, it should have vanished out of nowhere. It took me a moment to like realize what happened and I was like, what? So, yeah, just wanted to call that in and see what you had. Thank you so much. Bye.
