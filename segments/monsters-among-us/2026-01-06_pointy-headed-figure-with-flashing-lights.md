[Speaker D] G', day, Derek. My name's Jack, from Australia.

[Speaker I] Got a little story for you.

[Speaker D] That's when I was a lot younger, I was visiting my granddad, my mother's father, in a place up on the north coast. And I would have been maybe 10 at the time. The place was just known to be a bit weird. Like there were stories of a yeti around, which is like an Australian version of Bigfoot, just a bit of sus area. Anyway, I was asleep one night and my sister, me and my mum were all in the same room and there was the lounge room beside it. The lounge room is in like the middle of the house and all the bedrooms and bathroom were around it. Think of it as like a square. The middle is a living room. We're in one of the rooms and I remember just looking in the direction of the door and seeing a light under it and thinking that was weird. But then I thought maybe my granddad was up watching TV late at night, he couldn't sleep or something. So I get up and I open the door and in front of me, maybe like a meter away, is this little figure, maybe three feet tall, like a meter. And I just remember his head being really pointy, like it was wearing a hat. But I couldn't see it super clearly because it had flashing lights on it.

[Speaker I] That were super bright. I kind of couldn't see behind them.

[Speaker D] They were so bright. I could see the outline of this little figure, like a pointy head, little body. It was like a mix between a robot and an elf.

[Speaker I] Anyway, so I just got really scared.

[Speaker D] Shut the door, turned the light on in the bedroom, and this is what made it kind of like a core memory of mine. I just remember my mum getting super annoyed at me for turning the light on and getting into trouble the next day, waking her up during the night. And I was just trying to explain to what I saw. So we both went out and opened the door. Nothing was there, obviously. But yeah, I just remember the time in the room. Like it felt like time had slowed down, like it was going at a different pace. It's like whatever that thing was, it was like distorting reality or something, you know? It's something that stuck with me my whole life. I haven't really told many people about it.

[Speaker I] I love what you do mate.

[Speaker F] Came out the good work.
