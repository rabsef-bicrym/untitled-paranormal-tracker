[Speaker C] Hey, I just found your podcast like today a few hours ago. I've listened to a few episodes while I'm doing homework and I think I'm gonna start binging you, but I listened to A few mirrored men stories. And I googled it and I. I realized I've had an encounter with him or the men in black. Like whatever. It's all kind of the same to me. So. I was going through a really tough time last year. I wasn't there. I was having like a lot of health issues. But I just remember always like feeling paranoid, like somebody's watching me. I remember doing all this research about aliens and stuff like that and cryptids. Like I just found it very interesting and a lot of it made sense to me and like past lives and stuff. And I started to share what I was learning with people and you know, my health wasn't good. So I dropped out of college, went back to my parents house and recovered there. And when I remember having a dream where the men in black, I was dead. Begging them not to hurt my dog. And they were picking her up by the tail and threatening to break her spine. And I begged them, I told them I'd shut up, I'd do anything. And then I woke up and I sweat. So I go down the back stairs to the kitchen because I felt like something was off. I was hearing noises and I was like, I gotta protect the house. So there's a hallway going to the front door to the kitchen. And I remember hearing and we have a see through the front door. So I remember seeing a hat and a man standing there. And I just, I was paralyzed. I can't describe how I felt in that moment. And I saw another one. I started slowly walking over there and I was like, I'm crazy, I'm crazy, it's nothing. But I remember the middle one just being, just how it was. I. I can't describe, describe it. It was terrifying. I'm freaked out just talking about this right now. And I remember I just seeing like a silhouette, like light slowly going on their faces. And I was freaked the out. Like they were, it wasn't. They were solid. They were not see through or anything. So I was, I freaked out. I. I thought people were trying to break in and kill me. I mean that's how I felt. Like three solid men in hats standing on my front door. I run up to my dad's room and I told him to get the gun and he checked the cameras, nobody was there. And it's freaked me out ever since. But description of them just like how you describe it in recent episodes. It scared the sh out of me. I'm still freaked out, but I am in the suburbs outside of Atlanta. Love your show. Just started learning how to use the podcast app. But anyway, keep doing what you do.
