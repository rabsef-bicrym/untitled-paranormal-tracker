[Speaker C] Hey there, Derek. This is K again. I just remembered a story I had back from when I was in Stirling, Scotland. So I was walking home from my friend's house or his flat, which is at the university there in Sterling. And my house was across. Or my flat again was across the river from his, from the university. So I had to make a pretty circuitous route to get down to the bridge and get back over to where I was. And so we had had a couple drinks, but by that time we had all sobered up and I started to head home. And this is Scotland, so of course it was raining. And I noticed because there's a fairly wide or fairly long stretch of road that's it doesn't really have anything on it outside of just, you know, there's like a herd of cattle to your right and then not much else as you're walking back. And this is around 3 o' clock in the morning. And as I'm walking just, you know, bundled up and trying to kind of just get back home, go to sleep. I notice it's like the feeling of being watched, but like exponentially bigger than any anytime I'd had it before. Like it was like, you're being watched. Turn around right now and look. And so I did. And I noticed at first I didn't really see anything just through the rain. But I noticed at the edge of the light from one of these street lights there was this figure. And it was kind of just cloaked, you know, with how the rain kind of just makes everything kind of seem fuzzy. And it was just barely outside of the light, so I couldn't make out much of it. And so I thought that was a bit creepy. But I figured maybe it was just somebody walking, but it was standing completely still. So I continued on my way and just kind of kept glancing back and I couldn't see it a couple of times. And then about like halfway back to my flat, I felt that same feeling again. I turn around and there's the same figure except for it's actually in the middle of the street lights of one of the street lights. Like the light coming down from it, right under it. But it still has that shadowy form that I can't make out. Just like I said. I mean, it looks like it was wearing, like, I guess I would approximate wearing a cloak, but it's just super shadowy and fuzzy because of the. Because of the rain. And so I started to get a little worried and a bit paranoid. So I, you know, I grabbed my keys and I kind of put them into a fist pack to kind of. If anybody started something, I could, you know, try and go. I mean, I'm from Albuquerque, so I'm used to, you know, crazy people every once in a while. But, you know, Sterling was like, their crime rate is so much lower, it's insane. So I keep going, and. And every time I look, this thing's at a street light. And it's just barely. Like, it's getting slightly closer to me each time, but it's still pretty far away. And so I'm starting. And again, every time I look, it's stopped. It's not moving at all. So I pick up my speed, and again, I'm just, you know, like, okay, you know, this is some crazy guy. I can get him or something like that. But just the way that it was shrouded, I mean, like. Because I had seen somebody else walking earlier. And, like, they were kind of hard to make out, but they. I mean, at the same distance, I could see. See, like, you know, what they were wearing, what they looked like. But this figure, I couldn't see anything even when it was completely illuminated. And so eventually, I get over to the bridge, which is this old stone bridge that crosses over the river forth. Very old stone walkway. And so I start crossing over. And then again, I get that feeling one last time to look around. And I look back, and I see this figure. And it's standing right at the base of the bridge. And I can feel that it's looking at me. But I. And, like, I kind of stared at it for a little bit, and then I kind of backed away and went back. And I was figuring if this was a person and they were planning on doing something sketchy, they would follow me over the bridge. I mean. I mean, if they. Even if they weren't planning on doing anything sketchy, they would follow me over the bridge. But underneath or after the bridge, there's a small tunnel, you know, underground footpaths that would be ideal for if somebody was planning on doing something. There was a person, you know, who was planning on attacking me or something like that. That would be where they would go. And if. And if they were trying to get over the river, I mean, there was a road bridge there, but there was no other. But like this, the old stone bridge was the one that people used to cross on foot. And so, yeah, so I get over and I look back and I see the figure kind of still at the base of the bridge, and it seems like it's just not coming on. And so that's the main thing. That and the fact that I couldn't really see anything of it, even though, like, I mean, even considering the shadow and the rain. I mean, I could still make out the shape, but I couldn't make anything else out outside of the vague silhouette. And so that and the fact that it didn't come over the bridge makes me think of something, that it was something supernatural because it stayed there watching me as I left. But it never, never cut. Set foot on the bridge. And so I know a lot of. A lot of background with, like, spirits and, you know, other, like, supernatural entities is that they don't cross running water. And so I'm wondering if that might be, you know, what saved me, I guess, because every time that I looked back, this thing was getting closer and closer. But when I got to the bridge, it. And it stopped completely. So, yeah, so that's a. That's a story. I mean, I. I definitely found it really creepy. I definitely. When I got back to my flat, I blocked all the doors and shut down the windows and kind of stayed up a little while and watching everything. But, yeah, so. So, yeah, so that's it. Love the show. Actually going to leave a review right now, and. Yeah, thanks very much for it. Bye.
