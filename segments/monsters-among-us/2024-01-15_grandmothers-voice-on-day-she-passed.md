[Speaker C] Hey, Derek. This is Isaac from Arkansas. This story takes place in Colorado. For background. I never considered myself someone who's very, you know, in tune with the supernatural. I'm not someone who's gone out of my way to at all mess with that. Up until this story happened, I was hanging out with some family in Colorado. It was my last day. I had a great time. I was out at my car packing up very early in the morning for the drive back to Arkansas. It was around 5, 6 in the morning, very, very early. I was the only person out in the street. I heard the very distinct voice of one of my family members telling me that they love me. And it was so precise and so real that I spun around and I was a little bit weirded out in the moment at the time. I chalked it up to being around family members, you know, same side of the family that all have relatively similar voices. And I just thought, I'm hearing something. It's obviously, you know, no big deal, right? Big day ahead of me. I forget about it. It took me a while to call in about this story because of the, you know, painful memory associated with it, because the family member whose voice that I heard happened to be my grandma. And she was not on this trip with us. I was out with her daughter, my aunt. And, you know, I just thought at the time, no big deal. I've been out to this place a dozen times with my grandma. Maybe I just associated it with her. The reason I'm calling in about the story is that specific day was the day that she passed. And I don't know what time of day that she passed due to the unfortunate circumstances around her passing. But, you know, I do think that if there is some way for her to get a message out, she's the type of lady that would have done it. And she wanted me to know that I love her. And, yeah, it definitely has now shifted me into being more open about the possibility of that. And it gave me a little bit of hope, to be honest. It was a very sweet moment that I'm happy that I do sincerely believe she was able to break through whatever veil is there and tell me that she loved me. And, you know, I'm getting a little teary eyed thinking about it right now. So thank you so much for the show, man. You do a great job and looking forward to hearing this if you use it. Thanks, man.
