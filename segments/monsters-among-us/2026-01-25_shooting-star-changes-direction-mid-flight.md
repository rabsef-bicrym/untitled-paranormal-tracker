[Speaker D] Hi, this is Scott again. And yep, I've had a fair number of paranormal experiences in my life. Most of them haven't been, I guess, particularly dramatic. If that's an adjective that would be apropos for a paranormal event. But since I'm not sure how many people you got calling in, I figured I'd share another short story for you. This one involves a UFO. This was in 1997, and if I remember right, it was June and I was heading to work, riding a motorcycle. I live in a very rural area. Well, it was very rural at the time. It's kind of growing up now. Heading down the road, no street lights, nothing like that. Really dark. And I saw what I thought was a shooting star coming down at about 45 degree angle. It was very brilliant, but it wasn't real bright. It wasn't like illuminating the ground or anything. It looked like a typical shooting star. And I was approaching a highway and no cars on the road. And so I'm looking at this thing, I'm like, wow, this is gonna impact really close to the highway. Maybe I can get lucky and find a fragment or something, I don't know. And about the time that thought Entered my mind. This object, whatever it was, I wish I could give you a great description and dramatic description, but it looked like a shooting star. It instantly changed directions, shot back up into the sky at about a 45 degree angle. Again, if it had left a trail, it would have basically looked like a V and in the space of 5 seconds was completely out of sight. I stopped motorcycle for a second and was like, holy crap, what did I just see? And that was it. Bright. I mean, if you can just picture a shooting star that drops down at a 45 degree angle and then shoots back up at a 45 degree angle at what I saw, I don't know of any terrestrial technology that's capable of that. Last time I checked, shooting stars don't change direction. So anyhow, I hope you found that enjoyable. Keep up the good show. I love the podcast. Take care.
