[Speaker B] Hi Derek. My name is Liz. This happened in Minneapolis, Minnesota when I was about five years old. I say approximately 1970. My family and I went to visit my great Aunt Aga and Uncle Ben in a house on the other side of the city. I can't exactly remember. I was too small. We were all sitting in their small kitchen. They had a small one story bungalow type cottage with a small fenced yard and we're just talking away like relatives do. And the kids and I were all sitting around the kitchen table. And all of a sudden we hear this booming set of footsteps. You could actually nearly see the ceiling shaking, like someone was walking across from the living room to the kitchen up in the attic. And my aunt Aga was terrified, and she looked around and told my dad that this had happened many, many times since they had moved in. And they could not figure out what was going on. And my dad said, well, someone's up there. I'm going to go up there and kick their butt. And so he had my uncle. They were an elderly couple, mind you. So my uncle brought the stepladder, my dad got a flashlight. And we're all standing there transfixed because the entrance to the attic was in the kitchen. And my father pushed it up and he slid it over. And the footsteps, you could clearly hear someone pacing back and forth and a heavy stomping, just crazy heavy. And he turns on the flashlight and he looks around and we can all kind of see up there. And my dad says, there's nothing. There's no one. They didn't even have anything up there. It was just dust. And he said, there's no footprints in the dust. But you could still hear the footsteps coming towards my father and away from him. And we just didn't know what to do. And so my father quickly closed the attic door and locked it, and we put away the stuff and we all said prayers. And I think it calmed down things down because before my uncle passed, about a year or two later, I stayed with him for about, oh, two weeks, and nothing happened the entire time. Well, I could probably fill several podcasts. I have seen zombies, I have seen Sasquatch, I have seen UFOs with like 10 other witnesses. But I'll let you go for now. Thank you very much. Bye bye.
