[Speaker F] Hi there. My name is Gary D. And I'm located up in Ontario, Canada. When I think back on some of the strange or odd experiences I've had through life, going way back to when I was just a young child, I Remember when I was in middle school, I had to walk probably about two and a half or three miles to get to school, and then the same thing back. Occasionally I got a ride, but a lot of times I walked, and it wasn't bad. I didn't mind it. It's just when it was snowing or raining, it kind of sucked.
