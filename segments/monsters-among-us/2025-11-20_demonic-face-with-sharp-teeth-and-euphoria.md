[Speaker E] Hey Derek, My name is Patrick from Connecticut, but the story I was going to share with you happened to me in Salt Lake City, Utah. So the reason I wanted to send this in is because I always hear people call in with sleep paralysis stories and they all sound very similar. And mine is. I feel like a play on that almost, but with a different experience. And I haven't heard anybody share a similar experience to mine, so I figured I'd pass it along. Full Disclosure of the night this happened to me I had been drinking a little bit, and I know that you've mentioned that alcohol can bring on sleep paralysis, but again, this isn't paralysis, so it's kind of interesting. I went to sleep one night and I don't know what time it was. It was maybe a few hours or less. After I fell asleep. I all of a sudden woke up and I'm laying on my side and I'm looking, I guess towards a wall and right in front of my face all of a sudden appeared this other face that I can only describe as demonic because it was a normal human face. But it smiled at me and it had this mouth filled with really sharp teeth. Pretty much your classic monster. So this face is right in front of me and when it smiled and showed its teeth, all of a sudden my entire body felt warm. And I wasn't paralyzed. I could move, but I just chose not to. And the feeling that came over me was just pure euphoria, like I felt really good, which is the opposite feeling you would think you would get when seeing what I was looking at. And this thing just smiled at me and I just sat there and I think I even almost smiled back because of the feeling I was getting. I can only compare the feeling to morphine or something similar because I had surgery once and when I came out of surgery. I remember they had me on a morphine drip or something along the lines of morphine, because that's what the anesthesiologist told me. So anyone that's ever had morphine, it makes you feel literal warmth and euphoria just, like all over your body. And that's what I felt when this thing smiled at me with its mouth full of sharp teeth. And then as I stared at this thing for maybe five to 10 seconds, it just slowly faded out. I think I just went back to sleep and I just thought, wow, that was really interesting. And I thought, I'll tell my girlfriend about that tomorrow. She wasn't even in bed with me at the time. I was by myself. Anyway, I never forgot about it. Probably happened like maybe 15 years ago now. And I thought I'd pass it along because I just think it's a different twist on the whole sleep paralysis thing because I wasn't paralyzed. In fact, I felt amazing. Anyway, I love the show. Have a good one.
