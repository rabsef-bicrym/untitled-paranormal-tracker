[Speaker B] My name's Marina. I'M in New Hampshire. I have two sightings, if you will. One happened three days ago on the 2nd of June, and I'm almost to work. It's about 5:45 and I swerve out of the road to miss an animal. And as I look to see what animal I missed, it looked to be a reddish brown armadillo. Mind you, New Hampshire, no armadillos. And my fiance goes, what was that? I'm like, an animal was in the road, he left it at that. And then I'm like, kind of looks like an armadillo. He goes, we don't have armadillos. I'm like, well, it ain't a possum. And then left it at that. And then this morning, about 6:30, I'm on my way to work for overtime and I swerve to miss an animal. I'm like, oh, it's a turtle. And then I'm realizing as I'm looking in my rear view mirror, I'm like, like turtles don't stand that tall. It's a tortoise, mind you. No tortoises in New Hampshire. So I don't know what I'm seeing. But then as I'm sitting at work cleaning my stamps, I realize that was too tall to be a tortoise. So I don't know if I'm seeing prehistoric animals or. I don't know, it's just weird. Hopefully this can be shed light on and we'll see what happens. I guess. Hopefully I don't have any more sightings on that road on the way to work. So love the podcast. Keep it up and we'll see if I have more sightings. Bye.
