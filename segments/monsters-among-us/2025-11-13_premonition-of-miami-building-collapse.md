[Speaker B] Hi, Derek. So this is Danny. I live in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. What happened to me was from when I lived in Miami, but I thought I would mention that I live here because I know that there was a call from 2024 that, you know, was based in Eau Claire here. I lived in Miami for, like, two years, and this was during the pandemic. You know, I actually moved there, like, three months before the pandemic and then, you know, spent my time there. You know, I guess for more context, I lived in a tall apartment complex. My apartment was on, like, the 17th floor. So anyways, there was one just completely random night, random day, random night during the week. And this is in the middle of the night. So I was sleeping, I was in a dead sleep, and I suddenly woke up in the middle of the night, like, woke up from a dead sleep, automatically feeling this, like, sense of fear and this sense of anxiety that felt very real to me in that moment that I was having anxiety over the fact that I thought the building was going to collapse. I was like, the building is going to collapse. I'm freaking out. Which makes no sense, you know, at least to when I woke up just, you know, randomly. This is something that's never happened to me before. And it, you know, hasn't happened before then, and it hasn't happened since. It was just really, really odd. And so I was really worked up. And I was at the point where I was like, I'm gonna wake up my boyfriend that I had at the time, or I'm just gonna get up and I'm gonna go down to the lobby. I don't know, just feeling extremely uncomfortable. And, you know, I ended up talking myself down. I was like, you know, I'm just. I don't know what's going on, but I'm just overreacting. And, you know, this makes no sense for me to wake up and feel this. So I ended up, you know, getting back to sleep and the night continued on as usual. And then the next morning, all over the news was this video that they had that a building near Miami beach had collapsed. Just completely collapsed in the middle of the night due to, I don't know, structural issues. There was structural issues and half of the whole building collapsed. And that, to me, I was like, what the heck? Like, I literally woke up during the night around the time that that happened, with this extreme anxiety that the building was going to collapse. And this to me, just doesn't really make that much sense or I can't make sense of what happened to me in that moment. And I went back and I was looking at the time because I know that when I woke up that night, it was like around one in the morning. I know this because I had checked the time because I was like, you know, should I go downstairs or down in the lobby or should I? And so I checked the time. It was around like one in the morning. And then when looking at the video of this building collapsing and the time, the time that it collapsed was like around like 1:20ish in the morning. I don't know exactly. But yeah, that just felt very weird to me. And it kind of is something that sticks with me a lot as, like, this really weird situation that I had. I don't really know, you know, if that was a premonition or a residual, I don't know, energy, whatever. I'm not totally sure. So maybe, you know, you can give me some insight on that or, you know, let me know what you think. I really love the show. Thank you so much and hopefully talk soon. Bye.
