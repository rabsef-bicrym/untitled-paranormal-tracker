[Speaker D] Hey, Derek, it's JW from Alabama. This happened in 1996. I was approximately six years old, and, you know, I'm laying in the bed beside my mom and dad. I had a hard time sleeping by myself back then, and all of a sudden, I just woke up. I can't recall anything in particular waking me up. And I didn't wake up startled or anything like that. There was no loud noises that woke me up. I just kind of woke up. I see the outline of something kind of hovering over my face. There was a night light in my mom and dad's master bathroom, and it was surprisingly bright enough to kind of give a very small glimmer of light into the rest of their bedroom. And that's probably how I was even able to see the outline of whatever was hovering over me. I couldn't make out a ton of the details, but here's what led me to believe that it was what I recall as the Sandman. The outline of this thing looked much like what you would see depicted in cartoons and movies and things of that nature of the sandman. So, you know, I'm awake, and all of a sudden I see the classic outline of a wizard hat, you know, fairly baggy clothing. It freaked me out. It was not a welcoming sight for me to, you know, see a dark figure hovering over me. And so I screamed. And as soon as I screamed, I hear a sound like a. And I feel a type of material literally hit my eyes. And I immediately fall asleep. I mean, a deep sleep. It was almost as if this thing knocked me out with whatever it threw at me, you know, the next morning when I woke up, I asked my parents, did you see that thing? What thing? You know. What are you talking about? I saw the Sandman. And, you know, they passed it off as just a young boy's imagination. I was like, no, no, no. I saw something, and it threw something in my eyes. They're like, oh, you know, jw, we all have that in our eyes when we wake up. And, yes, I understand now that I'm 33 that there's some biology involved with what you wake up, the crust on your eyes. I get it. But even still, now, as an adult, I still stand by what I saw that night, what I experienced, what I felt. I don't know what it was, but to this day I just call it the Sandman. I've never told anyone about this ever, other than my parents. Anyways, I appreciate your hard work for us, Derek. Peace.

[Speaker B] Well folks, what do you think? Weird enough for you? Thank you JW for creeping us out.
