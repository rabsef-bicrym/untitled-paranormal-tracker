[Speaker E] Hello there. My name is Santos Coles. The story that I actually have here, it takes place in Glendale, Arizona. So the way that my family is, we're the kind of family that we always intentionally get on each other's nerves. Like, it's just what we do. We'll play pranks on each other, will, you know, push some buttons every now and then. But that's just our way of showing you that we love you. We may be picking on one another, but when it comes time to, you know, stand up and have each other's backs, that's always something you can rely on 100%. But we did have boundaries. Like, for instance, my younger brother, he was really, really self conscious about a stutter that he had when he was younger. So everything was fair game to pick on him with, except that. But everyone had a boundary, and that's going to be really, really important here. This house that we lived in actually was built in about 1963. We moved in at about 2007. So it already had its fair share of, you know, people come and go. Anyway, it's about 2007, Halo 3 literally just came out and we were ready for it. Like, my mom, she had actually bought five or six boxes of pizza that night. We had like some Code Red Mountain Dew. It was going to be an all night thing. So with that, I had just gotten home because I was playing basketball at the park and I was really starting to get into my faith in Christianity. I'm a Baptist Christian now. I was really, really getting into my faith at the time. Anyway, I noticed that as I'm walking through my room, everybody's ready. You know, my older brother, my younger brother and my sister, we all play cable together all the time. So when the third one came out, you know, we were ecstatic about that. But anyway, I get into the room and I immediately, I notice like this really strong putrid smell. I couldn't put my finger on it precisely, but it was one of those smells that just jammed your nostrils, you know. So I was like, oh my God. I'm like, what is that? Now to my left, I had my bed. And then I had like this little shelving unit right at the head of my bed where I usually kept all my things. And I also had like a cross, not a crucifix, a cross that I actually bought not too long before that. And I looked at and I'm instantly just livid. What I see when I look, it's like something out of a horror movie. The cross that I had was upside down. It's sitting on my shelving unit upside down, leaning, like against the wall. I'm livid. I come back into the living room where everybody's getting set up, hooking up the Xbox. I'm furious. I'm like, who was in my room? Everybody still straight face, looking at the game or looking at the TV screen. And I'm, who was in my room? And my older brother Francis, he's like, what are you talking about? Now, I didn't want to tell them because I didn't want anybody to be quick to claim credit for this prank. Now, the thing is, they knew this was my boundary. I kind of expressed that it's not something that I want to have made fun of and prodded with me, which is why I was so furious. And I'm just, who was in my bedroom? My young brother Pablo goes, dude, nobody was in your room. And I'm just not believing it. Again, Francis, like, what happened then? My mom obviously is here and she comes out, she goes, son, what's going on? You know, why are you yelling? I'm like, somebody was messing with myself in my room. Now, of course there was a possibility somebody was going to get in trouble, right? So everybody gets more defensive thoughts. Nobody was in your effing room, dude. Nobody was in your room. And it got to the point to where I'm just like, maybe no one was. Like, I'm just thinking to myself, maybe nobody actually was because the way that they also are, too. One telltale sign of theirs is somebody will start laughing or, you know, start getting really sarcastic about it. No one did. I'm like, oh, my God. And then I noticed when I look back on it, I'm like, there was a really strong smell. So obviously me being in my faith, I kind of figured what that was, started praying on it. Thank you so much for the show. You have a great day.
