[Speaker C] Hello. I first want to thank Zhanglist Podcast for sending me in your direction. I have two stories about the mirrored men. I thought I was just seeing things, but now it makes sense. They both take place in the Chicagoland area. The first story is actually from my sister. This was at least a decade ago. She was sleeping in her room just directly above mine and it was about 1am when she suddenly woke up.

[Speaker D] She said that at the edge of.

[Speaker C] Her bed were these three figures, all just sitting there watching her. She described them as being like monks, probably just meaning they were cloaked. Anyway, she said they sat there watching her for five minutes and they turned all together and slowly walked down the hall into my other sister's room. My other sister hasn't said anything about seeing anything. My mom and other siblings, they just told her she was dreaming. Thank you for helping others like me feel like our stories are real.
