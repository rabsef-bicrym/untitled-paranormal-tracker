[Speaker C] Hello. My name is, we'll say Mac from Indiana, and I was about 12 years old. I was at my house that my grandfather had built. One of my mom's sisters was living there. I was in the living room watching TV with her two labs beside me. All of a sudden one of the labs stood up, looking behind me. She started to show her teeth and growl. You know, you get that feeling when someone walks up behind you slowly and quietly trying to scare you. My older brother was horrible at terrifying me, so I thought it was possibly him. And so all of a sudden the other dog stands up and she Steps up on the couch with the front paws looking behind me. Also not at me, directly behind me, showing her teeth. And these are two of the most docile dogs I'd ever known. I've never seen behave like this. I turned into what I would consider like the blob. I just slid off the couch, into the floor, rolled. I played sports and I dove into the kitchen onto a freshly waxed floor and picked up speed and slid head first into the kitchen cabinet. My aunt jumped up. I scared her. And the dogs were sliding right behind me. I told him what I'd experienced. My mom laughed at me and my aunt laughed at me. Anyway, thank you very much. I enjoy your show.
