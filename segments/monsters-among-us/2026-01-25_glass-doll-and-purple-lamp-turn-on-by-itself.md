[Speaker B] Hi, my name is Ivy. I absolutely love your podcast. I am very intrigued by a lot of the stories on here and I have a couple of my own. So I figured I would call and share one or two of them. The first one is back when I was younger, around 2010. I was around 13. A little backstory. I have glass dolls. I love vintage old glass dolls. And I used to have a bunch of them. And my brothers would never go into my room because they said these glass dolls were haunted. I didn't believe them. I thought they just didn't like them. One night I was sleeping in my bedroom. I share a bedroom with my little sister and I am deathly afraid of the dark. Still am. I don't know why. I used to have a purple. Oh, is this purple fixture. And one night it had broken, so I put it off to the side in the corner in my bedroom. And I thought, I will have my siblings dad check it out and see if the bulb needs to be replaced. But it wouldn't. It wouldn't turn on. So I put it in the corner of my room and I went to sleep. Well, for some reason, I woke up in the middle of the night and I saw this purple glow coming from behind me. And I thought, maybe I'm dreaming, I don't know. So I turn around to see what this purple glow is, and the light is on and one of my dolls from on top of my shelf is in front of this light fixture. And I guess to me, I thought maybe I'm just dreaming or somebody had fixed the light. I don't know what I was thinking at that point, but I rolled back over and fell back asleep. Well, in the morning when I woke up, my doll was back on the shelf and I was like, well, maybe the light works. So I turned or I plugged the light back in and I went to go turn it on and the light wouldn't work again. So I don't know, I thought it was weird. Maybe I was just dreaming and none of that actually happened. It was just one of my many strange occurrences. Thanks for letting me tell my story. Maybe I will tell another one and call back. Bye.
