[Speaker B] Hey Derek and MAU fans, Tom from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania with one of those Gettysburg stories. Good old Gettysburg got a job with the state about 25 years ago, so I had to relocate to Harrisburg. And with the close proximity to Gettysburg and the historical buff that I am, I'd constantly visit the battlefield. So for a father's day gift. My ex wife got us a night at a haunted bed and breakfast. And then this took place on August 31, 1997. The date will come back in significance later on in the the story and the plan was after dinner to just do the drive through tour of the battlefield.

[Speaker A] Had a wonderful dinner and when we.

[Speaker B] Did the tour it was perfect time. It was when the sun was going down right before the moon was coming up, nice and haunting. Made the left hand turn on the straightaway approaching Devil's Den. And when you go to Gettysburg in the summer, you just have to assume there's going to be tons of of reenactors there. So as we made the left hand turn, I paused and for what we assumed was a reenactor crossing the road, a young man canteen. And I would describe him as looking like the kid in high school who was only like in 9th grade or 8th grade, but was extremely big for his age. Chubby and had the pretty mature beard growth, not quite the full beard, just the scraggly sideburn beard, mustache, et cetera, but a face no more than 15 years old if that dirty face, etc. And what struck my attention and even my ex wife as we talked about it later, was the shoes. The shoes were just. I looked at them and I said man, those look authentic. They were the brown, leathery up to the ankle, untied, black shoelaces ripped and torn. I remember the details because they look so darn authentic. So he crosses the road and sure enough, I'm talking not even 1000, 1002. Look in the rear view mirror, side mirror, my ex wife goes, is he gone? Yes, he had disappeared. And in this area where you make the left hand turn, where he was crossing the road, absolutely no boulders anywhere for this person to hide. Especially that quick as I said where he made the crossing, the only boulder there was a small little rock that went up to about your ankle. This apparition disappeared, plain and simple. So you know, we were like astounded and we talked about it and continued our drive. Got back to the bed and breakfast and you know, after dinner and everything, my ex said I'm gonna turn in and go to bed. I still had some nervous energy and I said, well, there's a pub down below, I'm gonna go and have a pint of ale and I go down to the pub and soon as I sit at the bar stool, the bartender had her back to me and I look up on the TV and the date August 31, 1997. Tragically, there on CNN, Lady Di just had her tragic car accident. And I was like, wow, what an evening. What a confluence of events. The first aberration I've ever seen in my life. Ex wife's only apparition she's ever seen. And Lady Di gets into a car accident and dies. By the way, nothing happened at the bed and breakfast. I went upstairs, woke up, my wife told her what happened and you know, we just said, what a crazy evening. Fast forward about a week later, the first chance I got to go back to that site of the apparition, I went and this was around lunchtime. I drove down to the exact site, pulled over, I get out, I'm looking around, there's a plaque and to paraphrase the plaque said where that boy crossed, there was a battle that took place with soldiers from Allegheny and Beaver County. And me and my ex wife, born and raised in Allegheny, moved to Beaver.

[Speaker A] County before we moved to Harrisburg.

[Speaker B] So I just thought that was, you know. So there you go. Derek, love the show. Keep it spooky. And being a Steeler fan with Will Howard now. Oh.
