[Speaker C] Hey, Derek, this is Levi from Arkansas. I'm calling from the Ozarks at the moment. I've got a story I wanted to share with you. I heard a couple of weeks back you had a. An episode where you had an encounter with a big cat. I think it was a black cat in specific. So I thought this story might interest you. A couple of years ago. It's probably 10 years ago. I was living with my parents. I had just graduated college and needed to save some money, as some of us millennials do. And so I went out for a late drive just to kind of get out of the house and get away from the folks for a little bit. And I remember being scared of seeing shadows in my peripheral while I drive at night. And this is in a small town in the Ouachita Mountains, about three hours south of where I am now. It's a very curvy road. It's a national forest. It's the Ouachita National Forest, which has a pretty rich history, I found out. And out of my peripherals one night driving, I see this black mass. And it's so black that it makes me stop. So I slow down and I'm trying to get a good look at it. So I roll my window down, and this is about 10:30, maybe 11:00 clock at night. And I see two yellow eyes. And they're not glowing, but they're a little reflective from maybe the side of my headlight. And all of a sudden I see a pink mouse in the. In the middle of this mass. And it doesn't make a sound yet. So I thought maybe I was seeing something. Maybe it was just the shadow, the trees and the headlights. But then it screamed at me. And if anyone has ever heard a big cat scream, it's utterly terrifying. It hits you in your chest. There's something, like, primal about it. And it sounds almost like a wailing woman of some kind, some creature, even of some paranormal entity. But it scared the living crap out of me. And I put the pedal to the metal, as they say, and it flew out of there and immediately told my father when I got back to the house, and of course he believed me. He has old stories like this, too. He's got Men in Black stories and so on. And I'd heard of mountain lions in the Washita or even in the Ozark before, but I never believed it. So I ended up looking it up. And I found out that apparently there was a proposal to move endangered Florida panthers to the Ozarks. I think this is around 2009 or 2010, so I was wondering if you knew any more about that or if your experience was somewhat similar to mine. Thanks. Love the show, love the podcast. Keep it up. Thanks.
