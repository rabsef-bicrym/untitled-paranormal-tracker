[Speaker C] Hi, Derek, this is Chloe from Northern California. So about in 2010ish, we moved into a new house. And, you know, my brother was little at the time, and we'd have brand new toys with brand new batteries that took a lot of effort to turn on or to make noise. And they would just go off at random times throughout the day. And, you know, you'd hear, like, footsteps upstairs. Like, and it wasn't just how settling noise. It would sound like a man walking around upstairs like heavy football. And you'd be home alone. So it was always just strange. Then, you know, things would just happen or fall or I remember multiple times I would, you know, get in the shower to take a shower, and every single bottle that would be lined up on the shower, it wouldn't just be one that fell. There would look like somebody just took their arm and swiped them all down at once. And all, like four bottles would all fall at the same time. And we didn't have a shower curtain. It was a door. And it didn't matter, you know, which side they were on. Away from the door, next to the door, or, you know, you'd always just feel like somebody was there. It always felt very unsettling. Never felt threatening, though. It just felt, you know, somebody just was there. And then it turns out I ended up talking to somebody who knew the people who lived in the house previously. And I found out that while they were living there, their son, teenage son, was killed in a car accident. And it just kind of clicked. Like, whether this was him coming home to look for his parents or. Or, you know, his energy remaining, it just. It clicked and it almost felt sad. But I thought, you know, why not throw a call out there? I love the show so much, and I love the community that has been built around it.
