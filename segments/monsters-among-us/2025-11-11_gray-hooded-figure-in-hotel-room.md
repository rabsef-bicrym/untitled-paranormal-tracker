[Speaker C] Hi, my name is Kathleen, I'm originally from Arkansas and this is where my story takes place. When I was about 17 or 18 years old, my oldest sister was graduating college from the University of Arkansas and my parents and I traveled to Fayetteville, Arkansas to celebrate with her. We came in on a Friday and then my third sister was going to come fly in that Saturday evening. So we got a hotel room. My parents got one room for themselves and then they got a room for me and my sister who hadn't come in yet. And we walked into my hotel room that afternoon and there was this putrid smell. We didn't know what it was. And my dad laughed and said, oh, it's just fresh paint or some cleaning material. And then I went into the restroom and in the toilet was a large Someone had gone number two and they had neglected to flush it down the toilet. It had created this disgusting odor. So of course I flush it and we give my dad a lot of for it, haha, no pun intended, and went about the rest of the day. Nothing weird happened. So that night we retired to our bedrooms, my parents in their room and I in another. Again I was alone because my other sister hadn't flown in yet, fell asleep just fine. And sometime in the early morning, maybe 2am I'm woken up by this incredibly disturbing feeling as though I'm being watched. And I wake up and at the end of the other bed that's just a few feet away is a man sitting and he is in gray sweatpants and a gray hoodie pulled up but to cover his face. And his face is like just blacked out and he's sitting and he's just, he's staring at me and he's resting one hand on one of his knees and then the other hand on the bed. And usually if I wake up from a dream at night, I very easily kind of blink recognize I'm in a room and I was dreaming and then I fall back asleep. And so that happened. This time I blinked, expecting him to go away, expecting it to be A figment of my imagination. And he didn't. And after a few seconds, I realized, oh, my God, there is somebody in the room. Maybe it was the person who had taken the dump and they'd been hiding in the closet the whole time. So I freak out. I scream. I turn on the light, I grab the phone to call the security desk. And I look back and he's gone. So I wasn't about to spend another second in there alone. I ran across the hall, my parents banging on the door. You know, I'm 17, 18 years old. I'm not prone to, you know, to anxiety or doing anything like that. It was very abnormal. And my parents recognized that. So immediately my dad rushes into my room, checks the bathroom, checks the closet, checks the windows to make sure no one had broken in. There's no sign of forced entry. It was just such a weird, disturbing experience for me. We called the front desk, we told them, and they didn't have any explanation for it. Needless to say, my dad slept in that room. And I joined my mom in their room that night. Still don't know what that was, but thinking about it now still brings up feelings of fear. And knowing that was not a dream, that it stayed there. Whatever that figure was stayed there long enough for me to be fully awake and still see it. That's what creeps me out. Anyway, that's my story. Thanks a lot for the podcast. I really love it. Yeah, bye.
