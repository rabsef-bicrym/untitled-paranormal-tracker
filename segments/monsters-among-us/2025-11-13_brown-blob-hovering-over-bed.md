[Speaker C] Hey, what's going on? This is Shondi out of Union City, California. This happened last night, February 6, 2025, around 12:30 midnight. So I was sleeping and in my bed, you know, it's dark in my room. I wake up in the middle of the night over my eyes, I'm looking up to the ceiling just thinking about, you know, my crazy dreams that I just had. And then I turn my head to the side and I see there's, like a brown blob about the size of a basketball, but more shaped like a football with the texture of like, a meatball with a squiggly line down the middle. And it's just, I suppose, hovering there. And I'm just looking directly at it for about two full seconds, and then it just disappears. And then I'm just laying there thinking, like, why would anything wanna observe me while I sleep? You know, I didn't feel scared. It didn't feel like a ghost or anything like that. My instinct tells me, like, it's more interdimensional or something, or maybe even alien, who knows? But that's my story.
