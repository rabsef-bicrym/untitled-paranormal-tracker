[Speaker C] Hi, this is N. I'm currently in Southern California, but this story is actually from middle Tennessee. I just wanted to throw out the big cat story in my family. I never saw it, but when I think my brother was in first grade, we moved to very rural Tennessee from a suburb of Louisville, Kentucky and he had mentioned a couple times to my dad that he had seen this big cat. I want to say he said it was black, but I can't say that with 100 certainty. But he was seeing this big cat. And you know, my dad was like, well yeah, you know there are bobcats out here so be careful, you know, you don't want to get too close. And my brother was like, no, no, it's not a bobcat. My dad was like, you know, how big is it? And my brother was like, it's a lion. It's like a lion size that doesn't have a mane. And so, you know, the first couple times you just chalk it up to, you know, like a seven year old's imagination being outside in the country, of course your imagination going to run wild. And my brother was an extremely imaginative little kid and he kept bringing it up. So after a while my dad finally, just out of fear for our safety, we lived on like 30 acres, brought it up to one of our neighbors. He didn't live on his land, but he owns the land right next to ours. And he's like, yeah, you know, my son keeps saying, you know, he's seen this big cat, kids imagination, right? My neighbor was just like, oh no, I've seen him, I've seen it. And at that point, you know, it's like what? And our neighbor actually told my dad that he had heard and this is actually confirmed now by the Tennessee Wildlife and Research association or whatever, the twra, that Florida panthers are migrating up towards Tennessee and more of the Southeast just because global warming is making it, you know, a good habitat as well as Florida's getting really populated and so they're being driven out of their own territory essentially. And a lot of Tennessee is still very rural, so they have been confirmed that here and there. I think They've got like 10 verified sightings or something. I just read an article from this year about it. But I'm wondering if maybe sometimes these big black cats that people are seeing are maybe these mountain lions or like Florida panthers that are, you know, roaming long distance after being displaced from their home or something. Maybe they're in a shadow, maybe they're dirty, maybe they're evolving and we don't know. So that's just my thought and I love the show. Have a good day. Bye.
