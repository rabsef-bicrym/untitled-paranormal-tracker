[Speaker D] Hey, Derek. I want to call this in anonymously from Arizona, but this story actually happened in Idaho about five years ago. So I was near Ketchum, which is close to Sun Valley, hunting black bears and wolves with my dad, and both of us saw just a really strange animal. The best way that I can describe it is was they had the body of like a Himalayan tar, which if you look up what a Himalayan tar looks like, they're like a goat almost. They got very furry body, like a muskox. They had the body of that, but it had like the head of almost a moose. Like, I've seen basically every animal that could be found in that area. I've seen mountain goats, I've seen bighorn sheep. I've seen wolves, black bears, moose, elk. This was none of those. This was something I had never seen. And initially, since we first saw it in the early morning, I thought this was just a mountain goat that looked weird because of the lighting. But as the day drove on and we continued to watch this thing, we realized this is not a mountain goat. This is something entirely different. Now, if this had happened in like, say, New Mexico, I could have just thought, oh, that's just the Himalayan tar, because they do have a feral population of tar there. But this happened in the mountains of Idaho in fall. We don't have tar here, and mountain goats, to my knowledge, aren't normally brown. So I just thought I'd call that in. If anybody else from Idaho has experienced something like that and know what that could have been, I would appreciate knowing. It's confused me for years. But thank you for letting us call in and share our weird stories like this. All right, bye.
