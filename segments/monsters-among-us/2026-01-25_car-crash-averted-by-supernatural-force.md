[Speaker B] Hey, I'm just calling in a couple stories while they're on my mind. This is another story from my mother when she was younger. I think this happened in rural Connecticut in a vehicle when they were teenagers, maybe ranging from 15 to 18. It was her, her twin. Well, she has two sisters who are twins and another friend of theirs. So someone had just gotten their license or gotten a new car or something like that. They were very excited about it and so they decided to go driving. You know, so this is before the roads or highways existed as we knew them. This was like a single lane road in rural Connecticut. And it was a road that there was typically no traffic on. So they were driving pretty fast, like definitely like a good 15, 20 miles over the speed limit in a convert. And my mom said that they were just, you know, having a good time driving really fast and took a curve where you couldn't see, you know, a blind curve. And I guess there was a tree that had fallen or something. And so there was a huge line of cars where typically there would be no one. You know, like I said, this was not a road that had traffic generally. So my mom said that there was this moment where they realized they could not slow down in time, that there was There was nowhere to veer. There was nothing they could do, basically. And they all looked at each other, and she said that the person driving actually let go of the wheel. That they, like, all distinctly remember that because they just. They thought they were going to die. And she said, like, snap of a finger. They went from going like 60 miles an hour with maybe 30ft between them and the next vehicle in front of them to they opened their eyes, sat up in the car, and the vehicle was completely stopped safely. No accident, nothing. And that they all just looked at each other like, in total disbelief. I guess they just drove home calmly that evening, probably a little shell shocked, and never talked about it again. So flash forward to a good like 30 or 40 years later, and my mom is on the phone with my aunt, and all she says is, do you remember the time in the car? And my aunt goes, stop. Don't talk about it. I don't ever want to talk about that. And that was it. That was the story. They never did, like, a dissection of what happened, but they all collectively, at the very least, at that moment with the car, confirmed that they all thought they were going to die and the person had let go of the steering wheel. So, you know, I don't know if this is like a guardian angel story or if it's just like a. Some. I'm not. I really can't explain it at all. And the fact that there were, you know, multiple people in this situation and that like, so many years later, my aunt, like, it makes her so uncomfortable that she's a nurse. She's very, like, atypical, you know, like things are facts and rules and things that don't make sense, make her nervous. So just thought it was interesting. I've heard some stories like this from friends where they swear they are about to wreck or flip and suddenly the car does something that's impossible, where they're like, you know, I could have trained for like 40 years as a race car driver and still not saved myself somehow. So sometimes there's just weird stuff that goes on, and I always find it a little bit interesting.
