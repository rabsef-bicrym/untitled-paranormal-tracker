[Speaker D] Hello there, my name is Kim and I am from Pennsylvania. So back in about 2012, and I will preface this by saying that I had never known anything about death before this point. Shortly after this my grandmother had passed and that was the first death I had ever experienced. So I had a prejudice going into everything as that everyone kind of lives until they're 90. So I used to clean houses and I went to clean the house and I had a second cleaner with me and she was focusing on the downstairs while I cleaned the upstairs. And I started in the master bedroom and bathroom and I Was cleaning everything. And I got to the bedroom, which looked a lot like any other bedroom that you would expect from parents. And when I cleaned houses, I used to try and make everything put back the way that they were supposed to. But this particular house, I had thrown the pillows off to the side. And as I was putting everything back, I was like, oh, I messed up how the bed was. And I heard a man speak, and he said, it doesn't matter. She sleeps alone. And I looked around because I heard it as clear as day, and I was really unsure because, I mean, maybe I had said it out loud or something like that. And I assumed that maybe a family member, maybe the son or something like that had come along. And I looked around. No one was there. I saw no one. And so I put everything back the way that I thought him I had been and just left at that. I was like, that was weird. And then I had went downstairs to see how my co worker was doing, and our supervisor came in to make sure that we were doing everything that was supposed to be done. And around that time, the homeowner's daughter had come around. And I heard my supervisor talking and going, like, oh, that's a really nice telescope that you have over there. And the daughter was like, yeah, it was my dad's. And that made my ears prick and going, what? And I was overhearing conversation, and she was like, yeah, my dad had died a couple years prior, and we have a plaque for him in our living room. And a little bit later, I had looked at it, and he had been a firefighter, and he had died a few years before prior. And she was talking about the family dynamic and how mom has been a widow since then. And that made my blood run cold because I had heard a man talk about mom saying, it does not matter she who balloon. And to that day, his mom had not remarried. She was not dating anyone, and it was just a wild experience.
