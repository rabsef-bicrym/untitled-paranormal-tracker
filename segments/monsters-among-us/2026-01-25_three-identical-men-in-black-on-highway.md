[Speaker E] Hi Derek. My name's Courtney and new to the podcast. I love it. I actually discovered you guys from Paranormal caught on camera. I was like, monster is among us. And I see you talk. And so I checked it out and I was like, oh, this is pretty neat. So anyways, I'm sharing one of the episodes with my mom the other night about the mirrored myth, just because we like to talk about, you know, paranormal and supernatural things. And she reminded me of a story my grandmother had told when I was younger. She had told my mom when they were younger, and she would tell us kids and grandkids and stuff when we were younger. And I had forgotten all about it until my mom mentioned it after we got done listening to one of your podcasts about the mirror. And I was like, I forgot all about that. So I'm not sure, like date time, that kind of stuff. But it was summer and it was in South Dakota, and I. I don't think it was on i90. I think it was on like a kind of a backwoods two lane highway driving from winter, South Dakota was in the middle of the state, headed towards like the Black Hills area, which is in the southwestern corner of the state. And it was just my grandma and my grandpa and they're driving. My grandpa's actually driving behind the wheel, My grandma's a passenger. And as they're driving this car all of a sudden appears behind them, goes around them, and then probably stops maybe 100, 200 yards in front of them in the middle of the road. And my grandma was like, what the heck? And my grandpa kind of got upset about it. And as they got closer, my grandpa, of course, was slowing down because he didn't know what was going on. And all three doors open at the same time. So the driver's side, passenger side front, and then passenger side back, all open at the exact same time. And three men in black all step out at the exact same time. My grandma never mentioned anything about their movements being slow, but she said they were like identical. They all got out at the same time, shut the doors at the same time. And they all had black hats and like black suits, black shoes. And my grandma had told my grandpa just to speed up. She said, don't slow down, don't stop. Just speed up and go around them as safely and quickly as possible. And she said, just don't even look at them, Paul. Just don't even look. We don't even see them, you know, except to go around them and just keep going. She was kind of freaked out, he said, in the moment. And they weren't quite sure really what was going on. Later telling us the story, she thought maybe they were going to rob them or something, you know, because they were on this backwards road that wasn't really busy. And it was daytime, though. It wasn't like night or anything. It was the Middle of the day. So they go around them and they keep going. And my grandma's like telling my grandpa Paul, don't look back, you know, keep driving, keep driving, keep driving. And my grandma said she happened to look in the outside mirror and she noticed too that they all had black sunglasses on and that was it, they just saw them. But you know, I'm not sure if there was ever any missing time or anything. My grandparents both now passed away, so I can't ask those questions. I was going to ask my mom if maybe she remembers any other details about the story because like I said, I had forgotten and it has been years since I've heard that story. I'm 40 now and so my grandma would tell that story when I was probably, you know, 8 to 12, I would say, because I remember hearing it more than once when we would, you know, sit outside and look up at the stars and watch for UFOs and all that stuff. But she would always tell us a few scary stories and that was always one that I remember her telling a few times. So I will ask my mom if she ever remembers if my grandma said that they were missing time or if the men that got out of the car were moving slow. But my grandma recounted the story. She never mentioned either one of those, but she always called them the Men in Black. And this was before I had even heard the term, I think, or even before Men in Black term was coined. So anyways, love the show, keep it up and sorry I was so late to find you, but I'm glad that I found you, Hope all is well. Thanks.
