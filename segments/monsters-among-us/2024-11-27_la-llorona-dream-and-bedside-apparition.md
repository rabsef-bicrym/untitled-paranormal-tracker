[Speaker C] Hey, what's up, Gary? My name is Omar. I'm from Chicago, Illinois, and I want to tell you the time where I think I saw the Llorona. I was in Mexico. This happened around 22,002, 2001, I believe, for me and my parents and my sister, who went to a vacation in Mexico to visit one of my uncles. And this one night I had, like, this very intense dream where I was walking on a beach by myself, and this lady came up to me and she aggressively just grabbed me. And she grabbed me and she asked me, do you know where my daughter is? In Spanish? And I said, no. And when I said no, she let out like this very, like, intense scream. Like it was this in my face. And it was so lifelike that I woke up from my dream. And when I woke up from my dream, it was clearly a lady standing right on the edge of the bed. So I woke up this lady standing there, she's see through, she's wearing a white nightgown. And I could see her hair. It was, like covering her shoulders. Her head was tilted sideways. She had her mouth open, but I couldn't make out the features in her face. And I could clearly see her standing there. So I thought it was my mom. So I started going, mom, Mom. And my sister, who's sleeping next to me, she woke up and she's like, who are you talking to? And I was like, there's somebody standing right there. And I don't know what. My sister saw it too, but she was like, turn the light on. Turn the light on. And the light switch was, like, arm's distance away from Me. So I got the courage and I got up and I turned the light on. And as soon as I turned the light on, the person that was standing there was gone. But I clearly remember her. I clearly saw somebody standing there. Like she was wearing a white nightgown. I could see right through her. I could see her hair, I could see her head. I could see her mouth wide open. And yeah, I think it might have been the Llorona or it might have been just some lady trying to scare me. But yeah, that's my story. And thank you very much for your show. I love it. Keep it spooky. Thank you.
