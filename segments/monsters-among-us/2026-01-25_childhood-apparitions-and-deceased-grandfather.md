[Speaker B] Hi, my name's Rockwell and I live in Salt Lake at the moment. I've had experiences all over the country, though, as I've lived multiple places. The one I want to tell you about now is when I was a child growing up in the Seattle area, I grew up in a rather strict religious household in the sense that we didn't talk about the paranormal. We didn't believe in the paranormal. Anytime that I would mention anything, I was told it was just my imagination. I want to say I was probably around 6 years old when I noticed that I would occasionally see people that other people weren't seeing. I had a younger gentleman that seemed to live in my closet growing up that my parents chalked up to being my imaginary friend. He was probably about 5 foot 10. He wasn't super tall, very thin, and he kind of just looked like a farmer or farmhand. And he would come whenever I would get super scared at anything. It seemed when I was in my room, he would sit with me on my bed and just talk to me about animals and farming. I learned about irrigation and different types of irrigation as a child. And that was interesting because, well, then I would talk to my parents about things and they would have no idea where I learned it. And then they would just say, oh, you must have heard it in school. Did you read a book? And when I would try to tell them about where I learned it from, they would tell me that I was making things up. And that's just my imagination. So I got pretty quiet talking about what I was seeing or who I was interacting with. For a long time. I tried to suppress it. Another one of the entities that seemed to follow me through my childhood was my grandfather on my mother's side. I didn't know him growing up. He passed before I was born and so I never really got to meet him. However, I would talk about all the time things that I did with my grandpa. And my mom and dad would tell me, no, you didn't, he wasn't alive or when you were born. And I was never one to sit still and look at pictures. And so as a little kid, I didn't know what he looked like. And one day when I was talking about it and on one of the occasions where they were telling me that I was making things up, I described him as an elderly gentleman with thinning hair on top of and the ring of hair around the side that he had frown lines on his cheeks. But his eyes were blue and they seemed to shine with just love that his hands were cut and calloused and that he always had on like a salmon color shirt and cactus flats. And my mom got really quiet and didn't say a lot of stuff and I was sent to my room. Later my dad came and asked me where I had found a picture of my grandfather and why I insisted on lying. I told him I wasn't, but that I was saying that my parents told me that I was not allowed to talk about that kind of thing or bring that kind of thing up anymore. So I think that's where I want to leave it for right now. Like I said, I learned to suppress my gift growing up due to those experiences. Then when my mother passed, it seemed to cause those kind of things to happen more. And I did turn to substance abuse to try to keep it from happening or having to deal with it. And then As I got older, I cleaned myself up and started to embrace the weird things that were happening around me. And I believe that stuff is for a later date. So thank you for listening, and if you use my story, that is great. If you don't, I hope you at least enjoyed listening to it. Have a good day.
