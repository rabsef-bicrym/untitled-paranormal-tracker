[Speaker B] What's going on? Derek? This is Jeremy from Berea, Kentucky. Kentucky. I have a crazy story that happened when I was deployed to Iraq 2008, 2009, I was at Al Asad Air Base and in the middle of it there was a soccer stadium, like just gigantic soccer stadium. And this is where Saddam had one of his soccer teams executed for losing a match. There's not much into that. And they lost a match and he killed him. So I was one walking home late one night from the MWR building, checking my email, calling home all the good stuff and where the path that took us back to our living area you had to cross by the stadium. Well, this is probably two in the morning and nobody's supposed to be on the stadium, you know, past 9pm because that's where a lot of the vendors would set up their shops and, you know, sort of activities would happen. So anyway, I'm walking and I'm just, you know, going about my merry way and all of a sudden out of corner of my eye I just see movement on the field. And of course I'm deployed. I'm on high alert. I'm like, hey, no one's supposed to be on there. I look and I just see these whips or I really don't know what to call them, the smoke pillars. It was this craziest thing. And of course I stop and I get a better look and all of a sudden in a blink of an eye, this shape just appears right in front of me and I just beat feet right back to the living area. I could have 100% easily passed my PT test that day. I have no idea what it was. I can only gather that it may have been Saddam's team. I have no idea. But if you have you know, any insight or know of any other callers that have any similar stories, I would love to know about it. Love the podcast. Keep doing and have a good day. Bye.
