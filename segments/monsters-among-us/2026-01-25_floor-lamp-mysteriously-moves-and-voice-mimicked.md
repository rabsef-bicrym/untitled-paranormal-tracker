[Speaker C] Hey Derek, this is Jack from south Louisiana. And I got a couple small stories about a trailer park that I lived in in college, a trailer specifically. And I moved in there, it's probably 2006, 2007, somewhere around there. And moved in there with a buddy of mine and my girlfriend. And it's an old trailer, kind of a rundown trailer park. We were in college so we didn't care. We had a lot of fun in it, but there was always kind of something weird about it. It kind of gave you just a funny feeling at times. But there nothing ever really happened too crazy, you know, we didn't see any apparitions or anything. But there was one time I had a new dog. She was probably less than a year old at the time, so she was small, she's a boxer pit bull mix. And she was really wild at the time. In our back bathroom, me and my girlfriend's bathroom in the back of the house, there was a old kind of antique lamp, floor lamp, there's a base. And then the lamp is, you know, five, six feet tall. And then big heavy top, metal lamp. For whatever reason, we had it in the bathroom college. So, you know, it is what it is. But we were all just hanging out in the living room and we hear this bunch of racket in the back in our room. And I'm like, what the hell is that? And then the dog comes running into the living room, scared to death, shaking, you know, tail between her legs. And you could tell something weird happened and it wasn't really like her to be scared of anything. And so I go back there, somehow that floor lamp had been pulled out into the center of the room. It was in the corner, kind of like almost behind the toilet, kind of in the corner. And somehow this floor lamp was just sitting directly in the center of the room. No way a 20 pound dog could have somehow pulled this super top heavy floor lamp into the center of the room. It's just a really weird thing. And then one other quick thing. My mom was visiting in town. We were sitting on by the front door smoking a cigarette with the front door open and my girlfriend was in the back of the trailer taking a shower. And I hear her call out my name. Clear as day. Obviously her voice, she yells out my name. And so I look at my mom, she's like, well, go back there and see what she wants. You know, both my mom and I heard it. And I go back there and she had no idea what I was talking about. I grilled her on it because I thought she might have been messing with me. She definitely wasn't though. And we never figured out what it was. It was her voice screamed my name. So really weird. Awesome podcast. Listen to all the time. Been listening for about a month and can't wait to hear more. Thanks, bye.
