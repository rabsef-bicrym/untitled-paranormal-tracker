[Speaker C] Hi, Derek. This is Keith from Northern Virginia. I was listening to season eight the other day. You had an episode where you ended up telling a story after a caller called in where the girl ends up leaving her hand over the side of the bed. And it got me to thinking of something that happened to me in college back in. Had to be like 95, 96. Actually went to college in Southeastern Ohio at Ohio University. So kind of maybe in the backyard. I'm thinking of where you grew up and that school was surrounded by national parks. And one time we decided to all go out. It was like a holiday weekend and school was kind of empty. And so we all decided to go out camping. And when we went hiking, we had actually followed this trail into the woods pretty far back about an hour. And then we went off trail and just kind of took a compass and went in the middle of nowhere really for about another 45 minutes to an hour to where we found this, like, plateau. Kind of sat up about probably 10, 12ft. And you could kind of see off into the rest of the forest. It was all just trees and foliage and stuff. But we decided to camp there. And there was probably about three or four couples and me. And unfortunately, everyone had a tent to sleep in by the end of the night. And I didn't bring anything. So I was just kind of sleeping on the ground. And at some point, you know, everyone kind of goes to bed. So I'm laying out there by myself, and all of a sudden the tent unzips and my buddy comes out and he's completely pissed off. I think he got into a fight with his girlfriend, found out she had hooked up with another dude or whatever. Made you so mad in college that he's just completely pissed off and just starts walking in the woods like he's gonna walk home, you know what I mean? He had been drinking rum and he was half drunk. And I'm trying to make sense with him, and he just starts walking off into the woods. And we're getting further and further. He's talking about getting a cab home. And I'M like, dude, we're in the middle of a national forest. You're not gonna get a cab. But meanwhile, he's just not turning around. He's walking in a straight line. And I keep on looking over my shoulder. And we have one flashlight with us. But slowly, the campfire's getting smaller. And until the point we had walked so far away from the campfire, you couldn't even see it anymore because we had kind of gone down off the plateau, so you couldn't even really see it anymore. And I just knew it was, like, in the direction of directly behind where we were walking, because we were walking in a straight line. And all of a sudden, as we're walking, you start hearing we kind of walk, walk, walk. And I'd grab them. We'd stop, and we'd talk a little bit. And then we'd walk, walk, walk. I'd grab them, try to make sense with them. And I started to hear. When we'd stopped to talk, you'd hear like, a. And, you know, almost like leaves rustling, and it would stop. And so we did that two more times. And the third time we did it, you could hear, like, three footsteps right when we stopped. And I looked down, I'm like, did you hear that? And he's like, yeah. I'm like, somebody's walking out in the woods with us. We started walking again, but then we turned around with the flashlight real quick. And it was this guy dressed in, like, a. Like a Davy Crockett. Like the deer skin leather with strings hanging off. I don't know how to describe it. You know, off the sleeves. And he had, like, dirty blonde, wiry hair. And he kind of darted behind a tree. And we're kind of like, holy, somebody's out here with us. So he turned off the light, and we just sat there for what felt like forever. And, like, no one moved. No one said anything. And then you just started hearing the. And it started coming towards us. So we took off, and we ran as fast as we can. We didn't turn on the flashlight, and we just ran back the way we came. And we were tripping over logs and getting whipped in the face with branches. And we got back to the campfire and started kind of getting everyone up. And everyone came out of their tents. And we've got, like, cuts all over our shins because we were in shorts and all over our arms and face. No one believed that, you know, somebody was out there with us. We were so far away from, you know, where you parked your car or where anybody would have camped. You know, we were like, it's a deer or something else. And we're like, it wasn't a deer. It was a guy. And I automatically just assumed, like, maybe it was something, you know, that had to do with supernatural. Maybe there was a ghost. The way he was dressed reminded me of, you know, like, a pioneer or something like that. So I did all this searching to see if there was anything or anyone had ever reported anything like that from that area, and I never found anything. And it was, you know, maybe two years later where it started sinking in that I think it was a dude. I mean, it was a guy out there, like, in the middle of the woods, just following us around. It was weird. And the more I think about it, the more I think that's creepier than if it was a ghost or something like that. You know, I grew up camping and with my family, and then my brother and I used to go to red river gorge and spend, like, an entire week down there just camping. And now, like, when I go camping, I want to stay in, like, a formal, like, campsite. And I've got, like, you know, an arsenal that I bring along with me, because it just scared the hell out of me to think that, you know, I'm out there that night, trying to sleep through the rest of that night was crazy. You know, everyone, when it was all said and done, went back to their tents and went to bed, including my buddy, who was so mad at his girlfriend. But, you know, I think this scared the crap out of him, so he went back to bed with her. And I just had to sit out there by myself with, like, every crack in the woods. Every snap of a twig had me, like, turn in. And probably one of the worst nights that I kind of spent. I got everyone up at about 5:36 when the sun started coming up, and we kind of hauled ass out of there. But thanks so much. Talk to you later.
