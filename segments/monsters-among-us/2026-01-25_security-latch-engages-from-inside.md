[Speaker B] Hey Derek, this is Donald calling again from South Carolina. Just another quick one. My father had passed away a couple of years ago and my brother had come to pick me up. He at the time lived in Florida. So we were driving down to straighten out his affairs and we checked into a hotel in northern Florida. I can't remember the exact town, but we got there in the early evening and we checked into our room and interestingly enough, we got hungry, we went out to eat. On the way back we got to the room, we used the key card, the door unlocked, but the little security latch was engaged. And I knocked on the door and no one was there. So we went down to the office and asked the clerk if they had this special tool to open up that little latch. They did not have that and they weren't going to have it till the next day. And we had all of our stuff in there, plus we had to be on the road in the morning. They were willing to give us another room, but I did not feel that that was acceptable. Funny enough, my father when we were young taught us how to undo locks and latches and pick doors and all kinds of stuff like that. So I asked them if they had a room right next door that we could access. And they did. And I was able to pick the door from the adjacent room. And we got in. Then I couldn't help but to feel that it was my father giving one last lesson or goodbye. Maybe a little less joke on us, but we didn't have any negative or weird feelings in the room. I just thought it was pretty interesting. Anyway, once again, love the show. You're the best. We appreciate it. And you have a great day. Bye.
