[Speaker C] So I'm going to start with my first story.

[Speaker B] Just kind of comes off the heels of season 11, episode 19 with missing time. The caller had an experience that I actually had as well when I was younger. Didn't happen here in Texas. It actually happened at my grandparents home in Massachusetts. I was about 6, 7 years old right before my family moved to Colorado which is why I was actually at my grandparents house cause they were watching.

[Speaker C] Us while my parents were looking for a home. What happened was is I went to bed one night.

[Speaker B] I knew it was dark.

[Speaker C] At one point I was awake just.

[Speaker B] Staring at the ceiling and it was like I blinked and it was morning. Like we're talking not like sun rising but bright like sun coming through the window. And all that thermosting in was upstairs.

[Speaker C] Kind of on their second floor, almost.

[Speaker B] A converted attic space. There was one window and I know the first question you're going to ask is was there three identical men? And I can tell you I don't know. I didn't get up to see because it was kind of one of those weird experiences, but wanted to share that.

[Speaker C] With you because apparently I'm not the only one that experienced that. And I appreciate the other caller calling in because it jogged my memory.
