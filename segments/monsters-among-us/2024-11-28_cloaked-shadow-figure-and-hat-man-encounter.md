[Speaker D] Hey Derek, My name is Sabrina. I'm calling from Northern California in the mountains. I am calling in response to your episode about Shadow People. I didn't realize that other People had experienced what I had until listening to this podcast. So I wanted to talk about something that happened to me about a year ago when I had moved in with my now husband last fall. He immediately had to go work out of town, about two hours away. And so we had started our relationship. We had started our newlywed ship, and I was staying in his house by myself. Let me just also preface by saying that I see and sense entities, spirits, just what have you. I have my whole life. And that's just to say why I show a lack of fear later on.

[Speaker E] In this story that I'm telling you.

[Speaker D] So a little less than a year ago, I was staying in this house by myself. It was snowing outside. I was pretty vigilant, you know, wanting to protect myself. Even though we live in a small mountain town, it's like less than 2,000 people. But I had this occasion where I woke up in the middle of the night, which honestly isn't rare for me at all. I woke up at around three in the morning, and I stood up in bed because there's this figure sitting at the edge of my bed. And I could tell it was a female figure. She was wearing a cloak. And it was a white cloak, but it wasn't regular white. It wasn't even quite opalescent. It was like the way the moon shines. It reminds me of a story recently that I listened to on this podcast about a person who had seen a cloaked figure on the subway whose cloak was the cosmos. This kind of reminded me of that. So anyways, I see this cloaked figure at the edge of my bed, and I sit up in the middle of the night and I feel a sense of calm, I feel a sense of peace. But I feel something else to my right side, which, by the way, the bed is set so that the head of the bed is in line with the doorway to go into the bedroom. And I feel a presence to my right. And it's like a man above the doorway who's crouched down on all fours and his bottom is backed up to the ceiling. His hands are clutched above the door frame like the top of the door frame. And he's wearing a bowler's cap and.

[Speaker F] What looks like a suit.

[Speaker D] And he's kind of like banging his head repetitively. And I'm sitting up in bed and I'm just kind of watching him for.

[Speaker F] Like a couple seconds.

[Speaker D] And like I said, I'm kind of used to seeing this sort of thing. And I just kind of knew because he was a silhouette. So Obviously, if I turn on the lights, he's going to go away. And mind you, you know, I'm very open minded. I like to look at myself as someone who's a believer but who wants to be a skeptic, which is kind of the opposite of what I hear from people who call in. A lot of people are skeptics but want to be believers.

[Speaker F] I appreciate that.

[Speaker D] I'm a little bit of the opposite though. So, you know, I'm open to the fact that maybe I sat in bed a little bit in the middle of the night. Maybe I was still dreaming, maybe I was still a bit in my dream state. Maybe I was hallucinating, you know, if anything, I'm more scared of real people than entities, you know. So I sit up in bed, I turn on the light, he goes away. But what strikes me as interesting is it took me a little bit to realize that a few years ago in my journal entries, I journal quite a bit that I have actually seen this figure before in a dream. I'm also someone who lucid dreams quite a bit. It's just something that I've always been able to do. And about six years ago I had this dream and it was a lucid dream and it was really pretty. I was in a house, but I knew that it was haunted. And I realized that I was dreaming. And as I'm ascending up the stairs of the house, gravity becomes less and less relevant. So I'm ascending up the stairs and I'm kind of flying. I realize that I could float at that point. And I go up to the rooftop of the house, and the rooftop of this house, there's like a sunset scape of pinks and oranges and all that sort of thing. But it also looks like a bunch of debris from something like a tornado. And I see this figure off in the distance. He looks like he's wearing some sort of a hat, maybe some sort of a suit. I don't even know, but I feel safe. So I'm on top of this roof fixture and he's kind of catching different pieces of debris in the sky to make his way towards me. I could tell he wanted to talk to me, and I felt like he wanted to impart some sort of wisdom. And I'm looking back in my journal on January 13th of 2018, and it says that I had an intense dream before I woke up where I was in a severely haunted house. Everything was haunted. There was a man, he was otherworldly. He had shades over his eyes. He managed to hop, skip and surf a shard of wood onto the rooftop with me with one other person. It was someone I know who was with me, but I can't remember who. The man peered through our eyes into our souls, and I can't fully describe because I felt at ease with him, but it felt like he was collecting souls, but like in a calm and peaceful way, almost like a grim reaper, where it was like he was just doing it when it was in their time, you know? And then he came up upon the rooftop with me, and he takes his shades off, and this is where it reminds me of the shadow people stories I've heard on your podcast, because other people have said that they're shadow people who have red eyes. I saw this person. He had a bowler's cap, he had a tie. He had, like, a blazer of some sort. And his eyes were like red swirls or vortexes, if you will. And it just felt like he had some sort of wisdom to impart to me. And he told me, and I'm reading from my journal, he says, ah, yes, you are aware of your mistake. You are happy now. Well done. Ah, yes, you were in denial, but you know this now, and you are moving on. And then he let out an accomplished sigh and he removed his shades, revealing those crazy swirling spirals atop the whites of his eyes. And he was grinning. And let me tell you that this dream stuck out to me so much that I took it to therapy and I told my therapist to be it. I drew pictures about it because I felt like the dream had something to tell me. Needless to say, I can't help but connect that weird sort of lucid dream that I had, however many years ago, to waking up in the middle of the night this last year, during last winter, where I felt like I encountered a spiritual presence. But what inspired me to call in was that other people have had this sort of experience, experience too. And I had no idea. I just thought, like, well, you know, maybe I'm hallucinating or dreaming or whatever. But, yeah, I don't know. I'm a believer, but I'm open to being a skeptic, so I would love to hear what other people's experiences are. Thank you so much for what you do. Thank you for your team. Thank you for your community. I appreciate you. Thank you.
