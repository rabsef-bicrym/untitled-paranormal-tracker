[Speaker D] Hi, I'm calling in in regards to episode 16 of season seven. The gentleman wanted to know if anyone had been helped by a spirit by the cops. And I've got one for you. My mother used to run a shop in old Town San Diego. She was familiar with all the local owners and her shop was within rock throwing distance from the infamous Whaley House. There is a story that she got firsthand from the gentleman that runs the little Creole cafe that is on the Whaley House property just to the right of the building if you're standing on the main street. Essentially he was in the shop or in the restaurant and he was the last one there. I believe he's the owner or chef or both. And he was locking up for the night and completely alone. He had checked everything and he was walking out the door and as he went to swing the door behind him to lock it, he heard a woman say stop. And he kind of felt like he had hit a wall and couldn't go outside. So he thought, okay, maybe I missed someone. So he turns around, he goes back in and he tries to clear the restaurant again to make sure he didn't miss a female because he knew he heard it. In the time that he is clearing the shop, the entire police force surrounds the front of this little shop. His restaurant was up kind of elevated and there's a deck with steps that walk down to the ground. When he got back to find out what was going on with every single cop in town with their guns drawn is there had actually been an armed robbery which was frequent and my mother herself had experienced it literally point blank while running her business there. There had been an armed robbery right down the street and they were all looking for the guy that had been the perpetrator. Come to find out this guy was actually hiding directly under the steps he was about to walk down as he left. So he thinks that whatever female was in this house, whether it be from his restaurant or possibly the Whaley house, that she could have quite possibly saved his life because he was armed and he had nothing to lose. So I thought that was a super fun story and thought you would enjoy it. Thanks a lot. Bye.
