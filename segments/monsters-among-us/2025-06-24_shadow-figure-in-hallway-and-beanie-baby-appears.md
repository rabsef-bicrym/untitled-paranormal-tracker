Now how about some more ghostly tales from the birthplace of aviation? Please welcome Hunter to tonight's program. Hi Derek, this is Hunter. I'm from your home state of Ohio and I have a handful of creepy stories, but I'm going to start with the first, which happened when I was about 10 years old. Now I was living in Belpre Ohio at the time, just across the border from West Virginia. So I was sitting in my parents.

[Speaker C] Bedroom reading a book.

[Speaker B] I was positioned in a way so that I was looking down the hallway where all our other bedrooms were. I was sitting there reading when I noticed a figure dart from my bedroom across the hallway into the bathroom. Now, I didn't think much of it at the time, so I set my book down, got up and went to investigate. Checked the bathroom, nobody was there.

[Speaker C] Looked in my bedroom.

[Speaker B] No one was there. I walked around the entirety of the upstairs. I was the only one upstairs, so I thought nothing of it. I went back, sat down, picked up.

[Speaker C] My book and continued reading.

[Speaker B] Now, I don't remember how long I was reading, but the next thing I distinctly remember. You probably remember Beanie Babies, right? Little animal dolls filled with beads. They have a very distinct sound when you drop them.

[Speaker C] A little TS sound.

[Speaker B] I'm sitting there reading and I hear.

[Speaker C] That sound that TS I lower my.

[Speaker B] Book and in the hallway is sitting a Beanie Baby facing me. A Beanie Baby that I do not remember being there prior. So again, I get up and investigate. No one was upstairs. I was all alone. At least that's what I thought. This is one of many creepy stories that have happened in my life. And this one in particular I didn't think much of till I grew older and realized how strange it was. Anyways, as everybody says, love the show. Keep up the great work. Thank you. Thanks, Honor. A possibly haunted Beanie Baby? Sure, why not? Like I said, Ohio is terribly weird. So I guess this is par for the course. Thanks, Honor, for sharing that entry. Now, having grown up in Ohio, one thing I can tell you about the state is that it's covered in cemeteries. 4,100 in fact. And that's not even counting family cemeteries, cemeteries owned by companies or churches, or those without actual internments in the past 25 years. So that number is likely almost twice that size. And that's a lot of graveyards for a state with only about 12 million people. And you know, this next entry takes us to one of these liminal spaces. Please join me in welcoming Brad to tonight's program.
