[Speaker C] Hi, Derek. My name is Gray and I am from East Central Ohio, and I wanted to tell you a story about what happened to me, me this summer. Me and my brother saw one of those alien black cats that no one can really explain. So we had been going down to check out My family's property. We rent a. I don't know, call it a campsite, probably next to a little river done by a creek. And so we had been going down to check it out, see if it had flooded in the rains that we had just had, or if it had had, like, needed to be mowed or anything. And so we were down there in the evening, I would say, and we had just finished up what we were doing there, and we were on our way back. Now, this is a little, tiny, less than a lane, really dirt road, middle of nowhere. Nearest house is probably over a mile away. A little bit of context. We live in a village, technically, and, like, population is about 400. So it's really, really secluded out there. And we are driving. Sun's not setting yet, but it's on its way. And we are just, you know, 30 miles an hour, just carefully picking our way along this really awful little gravel road. And all of a sudden, faster than fast. I'm telling you, this thing was the fastest thing we've ever seen. This massive black shape just, like, darts across the road and up the hill. And the hill on the other side of the road was dense brush, like very thick forest. It's the middle of the summer, so it's briars and it's undergrowth and everything. Nothing could have possibly gotten up that hill fast enough for us to not be able to see it whenever we tried to follow it with our eyes across the road. But as soon as it hit the other side of the road, bam, this thing is gone. So we didn't see it coming, and we didn't see it leaving. It just all of a sudden went across the road and was completely gone. Now, my family are generational, like, Appalachian granny magic kind of folks. So my brother and I immediately are like, what kind of apparition was this? And we look at each other and we're like, was that a cat? But the size of a deer. I'm telling you, it was massive. Just completely pitch black. Long black tail and moving so fast you couldn't even hardly see what it was. But we both said independently that that was a huge cat that was gone the second it crossed the road. So, like I said, my family's very into this spiritual and the paranormal and things. So I've got lots of other things that I can call and tell you. But I had just listened to an episode where several alien black cat stories were shared, so I thought I might add mine. Have a great day.
