[Speaker D] Hey Derek, it's seven from middle Tennessee. So I was just listening to episode 17 of season 17 and the disembodied voices calling a name brought up an old memory I'd completely forgot. So this had been 2003. I was working the late shift in an all night gas station, and it was just me by myself. And I'm kind of milling about the store, just facing stock, dusting, you know, just regular stuff. And I'm bent down dusting a shelf. And then out of nowhere, it sounds like somebody came up to the left side of me and goes, seven right in my ear. Now this is so loud, I actually jumped up. I was kneeling down at the shelf and I jumped straight up, stood, looked around, thought, okay, somebody just snuck up on me. And it's a fairly small all night gas station, so there wasn't a lot of room to hide. So walked all around the store, didn't see anybody. None of the door chimes had gone off to let me know that anybody had come in or gone out. It was just very strange. That's the only time in my life that's ever happened that I've heard a disembodied voice call my name. And like I said, it was so loud, it actually made me physically jump up. Now, I will say to this, I do suffer from audio pareidola. For those of you that don't know, my brain will tune into white noise and tries to make it sound coherent sound. So sometimes it'll sound like music where you just can't quite catch the lyrics. Sometimes it'll sound like muffled conversation, but never has it ever been clearly audible and sounded just like my name. Now, I will say that at the time I was working in this gas station, there was no piped in music. There is nothing particularly loud. Just me in the quiet. Anyways, Derek, just thought I would share. Have a great day.
