[Speaker B] Hi Derek, this is Helen from Arkansas. I had a strange thing happen to me a couple weeks ago. I lost my dog LB on July 2nd. He was a large about 150 pound Rottweiler who had developed cancer, started to hurt and he was a wonderful dog. So I made the decision to go ahead and have him put down before he hurt too bad. I went to the vet and one of my friends came to be with me during the euthanasia and we were able to be with him so as we were leaving, I got his leash and I took his collar off to take it home with me. And we walked out to the car and I put the leash and the collar in the back of the car and I went on home. A couple days later, I went out to pick up the leash and collar and bring him back inside. Well, the leash was there, but I could not find the collar. And I mean, I tore the car up looking everywhere for it. You know, I thought perhaps it had fallen out of the car, you know, looked on the floor of the garage, didn't see it. Asked my friend who'd been with me, you know, what do you remember? And she says, you put the leash and the collar together in the back of the car. So I just thought, well, I guess I've lost it. So that was around July 4th. So we went to 1st of August, and I was at work getting ready to go home, and I was talking to my co workers and I thought, well, I better check my purse and make sure everything I need is in there. And when I opened my purse, the collar was laying right there on top of everything in my purse. Now, I know the collar wasn't there because the purse was a very open purse. When you looked in there, you could see everything that was in there. So it wasn't there. And all of a sudden it was there. And I was kind of stunned. And so I went and asked one of my co workers who'd been at my house if they had perhaps picked up the collar and put it in my purse. And they said no. And I had been listening to the show, and I heard someone else mention how objects can sometimes be moved. I guess it's generally considered a strange thing, but the caller was there. I was very shocked. And I really do believe it may have been a message from my husband who's passed, and that was his dog as well. Perhaps that was just a way for them to let me know that they were okay and still there. I do love the show. I enjoy it immensely, and thank you for all the hard work you guys do.
