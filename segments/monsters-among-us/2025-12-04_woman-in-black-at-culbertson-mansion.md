[Speaker C] Hello. I like to remain anonymous. I live in Indiana, so this is kind of like a two part story. What happened was that me and my wife were taking a ghost tour in Indiana near the Culberson mansion. And one of the stories is that a local police officer got a call about the alarm inside the Culberson mansion that I kept going off. So he went inside, checked it out and he saw a woman in black just walking. He was thinking it was one of the actors from the Culberson mansion, like doing like the history tour or something like that. Then he Talked to the manager and he asked, hey, is one of your workers still here? And the manager goes, what worker? Woman was dressed up in black. And he goes, oh, you seen the Woman in black? Mrs. Culberson herself. The other part of the story is that I was out with some friends around that area, and I was like, you know what? I'm gonna drive past the Culberson mansion just to see if I, you know, see anything. Well, I drove past, parked it for about not even to, like a minute. All the lights were out except for one. And there was a black silhouette just staring down. I couldn't even see it. The blinds were in front. But I just have this eerie feeling that it was her. It was a very scary moment. Heck, I have goosebumps just by talking about it as well. And. Yeah, that's all.
