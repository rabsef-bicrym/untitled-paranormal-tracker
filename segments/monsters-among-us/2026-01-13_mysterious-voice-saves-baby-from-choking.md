[Speaker A] Hello. My name is Nora Gower and I live in Rock Island, Tennessee. I lived with my family in Nashville before we moved out here to Rock island. And this is where this story takes place. So I've just had my fourth baby and I am just doing dishes or doing something, you know, got four kids. So. Phone rings and I'm talking to my mother in law. I had just had my youngest one and she's calling, you know, checking up on me, hey, how's the baby? As our conversation ends. Then I said, oh, nanny, he's doing good. He's sleeping right now. And we hang up. After I hang up, I hear a little voice saying, go check on him. And I'm thinking, well, little voice, he's such a light sleeper. I'll wake him up. I'm arguing with the voice, right, okay. So I hear again, go check on him. I'm like, okay, I'm gonna go check on him. I'm checking on him. And I go in and my baby is blue. So I squeegee him out. I get the little nose thing and squeegee him out. And he lived. But I don't know, it was just the strangest thing. Anyway, that's my story. Thank you again. You're out.
