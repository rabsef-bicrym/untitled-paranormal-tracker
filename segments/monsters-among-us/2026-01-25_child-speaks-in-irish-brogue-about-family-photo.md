[Speaker C] Hi Derek, this is Mary. I'm from Southern Maine. I love your podcast. I've only gotten into it recently, but it has been my new addiction and I thought that I would share a story that is not my story. It was my mother's story, but it's about me, so I have to give a little bit of backstory for anything to make sense. My Mother was from New York, and her parents were immigrants from Ireland. I never met my grandparents. They died about five years before I was born. My grandfather was a chiropractor, and he wore these big, huge round glasses. And my mom said that all of her patients and friends used to call him the Wizard. So this story that my mother told me happens in western Maine, where I grew up. And I guess it was about somewhere between the ages of 2 and 4 years old. And my mother and I are going upstairs to go to bed. And on the stairs, my mom had put a lot of pictures of family members and events and things like that. And keep in mind, I'm like, I'm a little, little, little kid. I don't know anybody in these pictures. If I did, I'm too young to retain it. I don't know anything about my grandparents. I never heard their voice. I didn't know them. And we're going up the stairs, and there's a picture of my great aunt's wedding. And this great aunt was my grandfather's sister.

[Speaker F] And.

[Speaker C] And actually my middle name is Charlotte, and I'm named after her. So my mother said that I little 2, 3, 4 year old, I turn and I look at the picture and I turn back around and I look at my mother, and my eyes are huge and wide. And I say in a thick Irish brogue, which I'm not going to replicate because I still can't do it, apparently. I looked at her and I said, ah, Shurin, wasn't that a long time ago? And I said it, like, very sage, very calm. And my mom's just like, what? And then apparently I just turned right back around and I didn't even reference it. And she, like, chased after me and she was like, what was that? What was that? What was that? She couldn't explain it. She. She really only told me the story, like, one time. My mother was not the kind of person who would lie about this sort of thing or make up a story for attention or anything like that. I honestly, genuinely believe this. And my family's always had kind of a connection with the paranormal. And she always used to claim that we had family members who would visit us on occasion. And I think that in this situation, it was just my grandfather visiting. And I have a couple more stories, like, of family members visiting and other just strange things that happened both in Maine and New York. So I'll definitely be calling back with some of those. And I just want to say thank you for this show. I think that it's opened up a community for people to actually feel safe and comfortable telling these stories in a non judgmental way. And I definitely love it and will be listening to it. Have a great day.
