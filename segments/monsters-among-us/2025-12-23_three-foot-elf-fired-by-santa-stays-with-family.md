[Speaker B] Hi, this is Cindy Catchern from Amon, Indiana, home of the haunted Avon Bridge. So one day back in 1961, my brother and I were very, very young. We were at home with mom and dad and our pets, you know, our two dogs and our two cats. Well, anyway, we heard a strange noise coming from Brian's bedroom and we heard someone crying. And so Brian turned on the light, except that it wouldn't come on. And when dad used the flashlight, he saw there was a three foot elephant sitting on the shelf. And it was a very angry, bitter elf. It was just a young boy. And we said, what's wrong? And mom helped him down and put a blanket over him and gave him a bowl of chicken soup. And he was very, very nice and polite to us. He still wouldn't stop crying and he said, Santa fired me. And we all gasped and they said that can't be true. Santa would never do that. And he said, yeah he did. He said he fired him. He wasn't fast enough on the toy for Dutch and Live. And then he couldn't bake cookies because Mrs. Claus would get mad at him because he'd eat more cookies than he baked. So what are you going to do with a kid that's a spoiled brat? And his parents were shocked and disowned him. He ran away that night and came to our place. He somehow wound up at our place and he asked if he can stay here and we told him, yes, of course, we'd love to have you in the family. So he became happy. Dad bought him modern day clothes and he still remains as an invisible entity to this day. He will not leave. He resides in one of my toy halls and nobody can see him except me and Brian. So this is Cindy, Catcher in Avon, Indiana. Thank you for listening.
