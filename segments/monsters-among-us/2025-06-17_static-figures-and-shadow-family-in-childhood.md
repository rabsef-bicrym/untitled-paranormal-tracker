[Speaker A] Hey Derek, so I'm new to listening to your podcast, but I've been listening to it all week and my name's Brian. I'm from upstate New York. I've lived here in this area my whole life. But I do have several stories that kind of link together. After listening to a lot of your podcasts. It's brought back a lot of memories. First one goes back to when I was probably about two years old living in Ithaca, New York in an old apartment building with my parents. And at that time they were into the supernatural kind of stuff and they told me one night they woke up to me screaming and I was pointing at the corner of my room. I would not stop pointing or screaming. So my father said he just basically sat there and talked to whatever I was pointing at. And after about 10 minutes I sat right back down and went back to sleep. That's like the first weird thing that has happened to me. Fast forward to when I was about five. We were living in Endicott, New York in a split level house and I never thought of this as weird until I heard it on your podcast. But I used to see static figures. You know, no features of any kind. They were just human shapes that moved within other, I don't know, light. It was just hard to explain. But like people say it was just like a static figure, no real definition. I called them fuzzy people or something back then. And then that changed to shadow people that I would see in this room. And one particular night that scared me, I remember vividly. That's why I'm telling you a story. I was laying there and there was like a in my child mind it was a mother and a father shadow figure, you know, halfway up the wall in A seated position. And there was a littler one. And the littler one came down the wall and came across towards my bed. And it got close to me and I screamed and swung at it. And it ran back across the room, up the wall. And then I assume was communicating with the other two. They looked down at it and then both of their heads whipped in my direction. I jumped out of bed and ran to my parents room. I don't know if I saw him again after that, but that instance kind of sticks out in my head as something that was kind of profound. And then when I was about 19, living in a different location, I was living in a basement bedroom, no windows. I woke up in the middle of the night one night to go to the bathroom, I think. And I stood up and took a step, and I noticed a figure, darker than the darkness, standing in front of me, about two feet in front of me. And I don't scare easy, but every hair on my body stood up. I just stood there looking at it. I was basically paralyzed. And it just kind of like dissolved in front of me. But yeah, that was a pretty spooky story. And then me and my wife purchased a house, you know, about 10 years ago. It was an old house that had gotten moved from one location to another. So it was really, really old. And I did a lot of work in it. And I never noticed anything funny. But after our twins were born, my wife swore at night when she was rocking the kids, something was staring at her. She was convinced the house was haunted. And I had never seen anything until probably a month before we sold it. I was in the kitchen one day and I looked at the stairwell and I saw a black figure. And as soon as I saw it, it darted up the stairs and around the corner. And that kind of like sold me on that whole tale. But thanks for your show and keep up the great work. I love listening to this stuff while I'm doing my job every day. Thanks.

[Speaker D] Thank you, Brian. Static figures and shadow people. Perhaps that suggests that this place was some sort of meeting point between the two entities. Or perhaps simply a passageway that acts as a bit of a funnel and brings all these entities to Brian. And to come face to face with one like that, almost literally, It's a pretty close encounter compared to most that I've heard regarding this particular phenomena. And if I'm honest about your call here, Brian, it sounds like you might be the common denominator here. Not so much the location, but regardless, it's spooky stuff and we thank you. Again, Brian, for sharing it with us. Now, folks, if you have a story you would like me to share here on the program, why not give us a call? 888608. That's 888608, Nig HT. Or record your story on your phone and email the file to me at monsters among us podcastmail.com trust me when I say that we're looking forward to hearing from you. Now, full disclosure on this next one. I might be cheating a bit because it's not necessarily a shadow man per se, but in its own weird way, I think it still qualifies. Please welcome Jason from the state of Kentucky.
