[Speaker I] Hey Derek, this is Ray from Chicagoland area. I'm calling because I had a mirror man experience about eight years ago on Thanksgiving Day. I was watching my one year old cousin. She was already asleep. It was close to midnight and it snowed a lot the last week or so because there's a lot of snow on the ground. And I was at my aunt's house and basically the living room and the entertainment stuff was in one room and the kitchen was up some stairs and so I went upstairs for a cup of water and I looked outside and there was no light. It was a motion sensor light so as you know, nothing would be there. So I go downstairs and about 10 minutes later out of the corner of my eye I see a light come on and I look outside and I'm expecting to see it snowing again or an animal, something like that. But what I saw was in the middle of the backyard was three people, or at least what I thought was people. I, I looked and I guess one of them must have noticed because at the same time all three of them turned towards me with their head turned towards me. And when they moved, the mouth kind of came first. There was no teeth where the mouth should be and it looked like a, a shape of a mouth turning towards me. And then the face finally turned and I was expecting to kind of like go outside and be like, get out of here guys. But where their eyes were, there was nothing there. They kind of just turned back to where they were doing. They were just walking, or actually more like floating, because I don't remember seeing any feet. And since it was snowing, you think you'd be able to see footprints. So I kind of raced to the vantage point because I was going outside, and I see that there was no footprints whatsoever. And it wasn't snowing at that time, so there was no chance of covering it up. And so they were moving towards one of the edges of the backyard. And the fence they had was a wooden fence about 7ft tall, and they just went through it, just without even jumping, digging, nothing like that. So it was crazy. This part took five or six minutes, just that whole interaction. But as always, it feels like an eternity. So I run to my cousin's room just to see, because at that point, that second nature is, oh, maybe they're going for something. And so I went downstairs and nothing was missing, nothing was wrong. It was just one of those weird coincidences. And of course, by myself, I couldn't really tell people because they would think I was just freaking myself out because that house was supposedly haunted and you heard noises and that kind of stuff. So that's my story. Thanks for the podcast.
