[Speaker C] My name is Shelly, and I live in eastern Pennsylvania, near the Poconos. That is where this story takes place. And this happened back in the early 1980s. So it was quite a while ago. After I got married to who is now my ex, we bought a house, and it was kind of Outside the town we lived in, it was on the side of a mountain. And the house was about 200 years old, so it was very small. But they had built onto it through the years like there was a bathroom off to one end. And then they virtually doubled the size of the house recently before we bought it. And we were comfortable in it. But I started having recurring dreams. They started out the same, and then they would have different endings as you went along, until eventually they became horrific nightmares. And the start of the dream would always be that I would wake up and I'd be paralyzed in bed, hearing footsteps coming up the stairs, up the hall, towards the bedroom, and I couldn't do anything about it. And the various endings became bad after there was a kidnapping in the dream, and then finally there was an axe murder. That was horrific. The weird thing about the dreams is that our stairway was carpeted. And in the dream, it was definitely steps on hardwood stairs. And it sounded like a man because it was a heavier tread. So the guy I was married to was very meat and potatoes. And he was a skeptic of anything that didn't make sense or couldn't be proven. So I never said anything until one morning we woke up, and he said, I had the strangest dream. And, honest, my blood ran cold because I just knew that the dream he had was related to mine. And it was. So in this dream, at the end, you know, you were paralyzed, and you could hear the footsteps approaching. But finally I could move. And in it, I was in a shooter stance with a pistol aimed at the bedroom doorway. His was exactly the same, except instead of a pistol, he had a rifle. We must have taken this dream seriously, because we decided that from there on out, when we were sleeping, the bedroom door had to be closed, and he loaded a rifle and put it under the bed. So after that, I only had the dream a few times. Like, he would come to bed after me and forget to shut the door. And I'd have the dream, and it would wake me up. I'd get out of bed and shut the door, and I'd be fine after that. When we first moved in the house, we had a puppy, and we just thought we got a strange dog because he would look like he was chasing on somebody's heels, going forward, prancing, backing up, pawing the air, just like you would if he was playing with somebody. And we didn't think anything about it until we started hearing the footsteps upstairs. They would usually occur when we're downstairs later at night, and you'd hear the heel, toe, heel, toe. In the hallway outside the bedroom where we had the dreams, same area. He would go storming upstairs and of course nobody would ever be there. So I was thinking, okay, we got a ghost. But I never said anything until one night our dog went to bed before us. He went up to the master bedroom and all of a sudden we heard this racket where it sounded like he was trying to run on the hardwood. And a huge crash. So my ex gets up off the couch and declares, that damn ghost is after my dog. And he goes storming up. He did find that the bedroom door was shut and our dog was cowering in the corner. He was shivering. So we don't know what happened, but something scared our dog. The thing about the ghost was that it wasn't always there, but you could tell when it was there. There was a difference in the energy. And it was especially bad, like in the winter when I would come home first and you could just walk in and feel the energy in the house was different. And you could hear him walking around in the old part of the house. And the dog and I would just sit at the kitchen table until either my ex came home or the ghost would go away. So maybe it was that reason we didn't tell people about. Did affect people, though. Like one time my ex was on a hunting trip and I had my cousin come down and stay with me. And I was doing something in the kitchen and I came back into the living room and she was sitting on the couch, white as a ghost. And she said, who's upstairs? And yep, you could hear him walking around. And I had to tell her we had a ghost. And I tried to comfort her by saying that the bedroom that we were going to sleep in was safe because it was a newer part of the house. Then we actually had four people that saw the ghost. I never did, but I had two cousins stay over and a couple from college at different times. And the area that we would use as a guest room, it was a big hall at the top of the stairs, which ironically is where we heard the footsteps, but that's where we kept the fold out couch. And they all saw the same thing. Like they'd wake up in the middle of the night and there would be a man walking back and forth at the foot of their bed who they would think first would be my ex. But then they realized that the man was older and he had silver hair and they were too scared to do anything or call out. So eventually it would just disappear. So the marriage wasn't working. So we separated. I got an apartment, and for a while I would come home and we tried to work it out. One of the final times when I got into my apartment, I got a call from him saying that he went back in the house after I drove away, and there was all this racket upstairs in the bedroom. And he went upstairs and every picture of me was face down on the bed bureau, like something had come in and just knocked him over, which made me think I was the problem. And apparently it was because he did get remarried and they stayed in the house for a little bit and we were on good terms. So I would have to call once in a while with questions about taxes or something. I'd say, so how's the ghost? Have you heard him? Have you seen him? And the answer was always no. And I took it to mean that I was a paranormal magnet, which turns out I am. The house is still there. I don't get up in the Poconos very much, but when I do, when I'm in that area, I'll, like, drive by and I'll think, what is going on in that house? So that's my story. And thank you very much for listening. I appreciate it.
