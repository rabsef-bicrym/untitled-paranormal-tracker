[Speaker E] Hi Derek, I am going to stay anonymous for this call, but I'm calling in regards to an event that happened on September 26, 2024 and it began at 11:38am I in Western Washington and I was hiking on this trail called the Yellow Aster Butte Trail in the Mount Baker Wilderness and I was on my way to summit Tommy Hoy Peak. I started on this trail because the Yellow Astor Butte splits off onto Tommy Hoy Peak Trail. So I was still on the Yellow Astor Butte and it was kind of a rainy, overcast day and on my way into the trail I saw one man on his way out. We said hi and I kept on going and there was nobody out there. I've been on this trail one time before, but it was even more cloudy and overcast and foggy the first time, so it felt like a new trail. And about a mile, a mile and a half in, it's not above tree line, but the trees clear out a little bit and it's kind of like this counterclockwise C shape that you end up hiking around this valley and you get a clear shot right across the valley and it's so beautiful. But I'd gotten above treeline and as I was hiking I was kind of having this Bit of a fantasy as a solo hiker, not listening to music, I just let my imagination run. And I was thinking about how neat it would be if my sister were out here with me. Because my sister and I, we don't talk anymore, and I was just kind of missing her. And then I was thinking about how neat it would be if we were walking along and all of a sudden an alien appeared in front of us. And the alien tells us, you know, you're one of us and you get to come home with me. And I was thinking about how much of a relief that would be of, like, okay, all right. Like, something had to be up. So I was just kind of enjoying that fantasy a little bit. And then all of a sudden, to my left in the air, and if I look to the left, I can see across the valley to the other side where the trail meets. I heard a turkey gobble. Like the most classic silly turkey gobble up in the air. And I look up into the sky and I see two turkey vultures. And in the moment, I didn't put it together that that is a ridiculous thing to happen. That's normal. So I'm looking at the turkey poulters, and I'm like, oh, cool.
