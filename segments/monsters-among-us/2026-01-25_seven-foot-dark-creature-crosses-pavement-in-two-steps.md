[Speaker B] Yeah, hi. So I'm gonna start this off real quick with I have a stiff, ah, impediment. So if I'm stammering or stuttering through it, that is why So I live in the Pacific Northwest just outside of Eugene, Oregon and one night me and my buddies were down at Clay Creek. It's a camping site about 18 miles into the forest and it was about 11pm we were all just outside there hanging out and our car was kind of taking a poop on us. So we pull over and we're pretty deep in the forest by now. As I said, we're about 18 miles in. And so we all get out, we're just talking. No one's doing anything illegal. There's no drugs, there's no drinking or anything like that. And about 15 minutes later we hear something in the Elon musk. So we get super scared obviously. And so we take off into the car. Well, one of my other buddies stupidly pulls out his.22 and shoots at it. So now we get even more scary because we're like, we don't know what that was. Why would you shoot? So as soon as we pull back out onto the pavement, we see this curve, a feature like thing that end up on two legs. And this pavement's about a good wealthy wide or so. He looks at the car for about two seconds if that then takes two steps, boom boom over the pavement. So he's taking six foot to rise, easily six, seven foot. And then it's about an 80 degree hillside that he just climbs up. No issue on two legs. Boom boom. And I am not kidding you, the whole way home we were silent, pale as a ghost. Didn't know what we seen. Did more research about it and I've always been into this cryptology kind of thing. And we honestly believe it was a Bigfoot because we didn't really get a super good look at it. But it was almost a very dark black color. He had to be, and I'm not kidding, he had to be about 7 foot 8 foot tall, huge monster like. And the way he just went over that pavement in 1, 2 was ridiculously insane is what we thought. So having said that, I think we've seen a big tip that night. I don't know, but it inspired me to get a Bigfoot tattoo. And I've been doing research about it now ever since that time. That was probably about four years ago now. So anyways, I figured I would call you, let you know. I have a couple more UFO stories that I can give you a caller and tell you about later. But yeah, thank you.
