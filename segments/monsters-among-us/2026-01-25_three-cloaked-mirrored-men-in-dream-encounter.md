[Speaker B] Hi Derek, my name is Justin from San Diego, California. This story I have to tell you actually takes place in North Carolina in a small town called the Outer Banks. It actually comes from that mirrored men story I've been hearing so much about. And it's really funny. I heard that and it brought back this memory I haven't had in years. I was about 8 years old in the Outer Banks and I was in this small gated community where all of the houses are very close to each other. You know, the normal gated community. I was on the third story in my room and the third story looks over the front of the house, which is about 30ft to the road. Well, it was a dream, but it's insane how close these things matched people's description. There were these hunchback creatures that had cloaks and hoods and you couldn't see their faces. It was three of them, just like everybody had said. It freaks me out to this day hearing that the three of them walked down the street and they were walking, you know, I don't remember if it was that small slow motion walk everybody talked about, but it was. They walked down the street, the dream. I was barely sticking my head out over the windowsill and I see these three cloaked figures. And of course I see them in within about five seconds of looking at them, they saw me and they stared at me and the next thing I remember it was. It was morning. You know, I'm 90% sure this was a dream. You know, I don't even know if you could use this on your podcast because it's not much, but I thought it'd be worth sharing my experience and I'll have more to bring to you. I actually spent a lot of time living up in Idyllwild, which is in the San Bernardino Forest, as you would probably know. So I have some stories to tell you from there soon, but I just wanted to, you know, put that out there and let you know. Thanks Derek. I love your podcast and listening since season one. Wait to hear more. Talk to you later.
