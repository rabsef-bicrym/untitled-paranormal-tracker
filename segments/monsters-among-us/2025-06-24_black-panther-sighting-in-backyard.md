[Speaker D] Hi, my name is Molly. I'm calling from Ohio. I have a story from 2011. This would have been my son's third birthday. We lived out in a farm in Clark County, Ohio, in actually, South Vienna. And I am looking out our front window because we have two acres in front of us before the road. And I see this giant dog, and it's walking like a cat. And I was so confused because I couldn't process what this was. And we have all these children running around. We have all our family over. We're having a giant cookout, and suddenly it clicks. This is a black cougar in my front yard by my front pond. And I have all these children outside. I screamed, got everybody inside immediately. This was back before the day of decent digital photography. I did not get a photo of this, but my husband came out because he thought I was absolutely insane. And all the adults are coming out. And we confirmed this is a black cougar or black panther, some form of a big black cat. And we just couldn't believe it. So my husband, Whitney, got his shotgun, and he fired one round into the air. That did not scare it. So he broke out his.30 06 and he shot at the animal. But right as he went to shoot, I sneezed, which was very inopportune timing, and he missed the animal's heart region, and he shot it in its back hip. And it was A through and through. And the animal took off. And it wasn't until about six months later that we actually heard from the news what had happened. I looked everywhere for a news article on this, but there was a gentleman who lived in Zainesville, you may have heard, in 2011, that let all of his exotic animals loose after unaliving himself. Well, what had led up to this chain of events of him unaliving himself and letting all of the animals loose was he was having problems with animals escaping. And one of the animals that had escaped was a big black cat. I can't remember if it was a cougar, a jaguar, a mountain lion, or whatever it was, but this was the animal. And the thing that really got us is odd was about three weeks after the party, we had heard through the natural resources officers that we were friends with, because you become friends with your ODNR officers if you're a farmer. And they had said that they had had a big black cat found about 10 miles from our house in the next county over because we live right on the county line that they had put down that had a through and through bullet wound on its back haunch, and they were surprised it was still even able to walk. And that's my story of how sometimes something that can possibly be a cryptid or something we don't know what it is actually has a reasoning behind still just blows my mind. And I'm so thankful that we got everybody inside safely and nobody was hurt. I love your show. Keep up the good work. And I wanted to let you know we also made a donation to our local animal shelter of cat and dog food in memory of your beloved fuzzy friend. Thank you and have a good one. Bye.

[Speaker B] Thanks, Molly. And thank you so much for the donation. That is incredibly kind of you. And of course, Molly is referring to our girl, Annabelle, an amazing and beautiful black cat that we were lucky to share our home with for a full decade. She passed of cancer a little over two years ago. So thank you again, Molly, for that touching gesture. Now, I also grew up very near Zanesville. The very place that Molly mentioned was home to an exotic animal massacre when owner Terry Thompson released 50 exotic animals, including lions, tigers and bears on the town of Zanesville. All 50 were killed, though there are persistent rumors that a small monkey managed to avoid being dispatched. But I've never heard of the prior escapes that Molly alluded to. Not to say that they didn't happen. I had been out of Ohio for a good four or five years when this event went down. So I didn't exactly have my finger on the pulse at the time, so all of that very well could have happened. But regardless of how it all went down, your account was pretty incredible, if I'm honest. A bit tragic because I'm a big proponent of leaving these animals be. I live in mountain lion country right now and trust me when I say they're more afraid of us than we are of them. But keep your distance, of course. Make no mistake, they're perfectly tuned killing machines. Thank you again, Molly, for sharing your story. How about the employers?
