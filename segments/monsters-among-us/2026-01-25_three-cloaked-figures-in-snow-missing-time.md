[Speaker D] Hey, my name is Matt. I'm from Northern Virginia, but my story takes place in Amelia, Virginia, so a little bit southwest of Richmond. It was back in either beginning of 2010 or end of 09. I was living with a friend of.

[Speaker C] Mine at the time.

[Speaker D] We were playing Yu Gi oh in his room because it was, you know, late at night and we were, you know, dumb teenagers. It had snowed like crazy the day before. We're, you know, just like, nothing to do outside. It's too bloody cold, so we're playing. I get up to stretch my legs. I open the blinds a bit because almost a full moon out there. And with the full moon, almost full moon, and with the snow, it made it so it was really easy to see everything that was going around. And near the end of his driveway, just walking, there were three. I don't want to call them people, but just like three moving really, really slowly. I just see that. I'm like, hey, check this out real quick. And he gets up, takes a look at it with me. And we're just watching them move. They're moving so freaking weird slowly. So we're watching them for a little bit, and then like, I don't know, we feel like. I feel like I zoned out while watching them. When I look away, I just look at my button like, hey, you want to keep playing? And he was like, yeah, but what about them? And then we look back out there and there's nothing there. And then he checks his phone, and it was like four in the morning at that time, but when we looked, it was like, close to like, 11 something. Only thing I can think of is, well, after listening to a lot of your podcasts and you talking about the mirrored men, that's all I can think of is what they were. Yeah, I hope you like my story. Haven't seen anything like them since. Hadn't seen anything like them before. Didn't even know what they were until I heard that podcast. Thanks. I love the show. I've been listening since almost the beginning. Thanks. I hope you're able to use my story. Hey, this is Matt from Northern Virginia with the story about the Mirror Men. I got in touch with my friend. I haven't talked to him in a while. Asked him what he could remember about it. Basically from what we can both remember from talking about this for a while. The mailbox from his house is about 100 to 150ft away from his house, still far enough that we could see it, but close enough that we could see it, but far enough. We can't really get, like, facial features and everything. Not that we could really see their faces. They were wearing cloaks, but like we could see. We see like I swear I saw an arm.

[Speaker C] But.

[Speaker D] Other than the cloaks, we couldn't really see many features of them. But from what we could see is it looked kind of like they had jerky movements when they were walking, but each one of them had the same same jerky movement when they were walking. Other than that, I we can't really remember much. It was about like seven years ago. I know it's not much more detailed, but that's all we can both remember from talking about it. Hope that helps a bit. Love the podcast. Thank you.
