[Speaker B] Hi, my name is Ash, and this story takes place in Arizona. It's one of the schools on the reservation. It's actually a private Catholic school, but I won't be saying the name of the school for privacy reasons. I attended there through my freshman. Through my senior year. And while I was there, there's actually stories about the school. So the school was built in 1902, and it used to be a boarding school for native children. And where the kids used to stay, it's, like, very on the top floor. It's now, like a sister's chapel. But like I said, it used to be, like, where the native kids used to stay. We get, like, tourists all the time to, like, come toward the school and all that stuff. And there was one story where they were staying there, and they said that they heard children laughing and, like, there was nobody there. And they said that one time a ball, like, just bounced out one of the room, and there was no kids up there because it's just, like, a tourist group of adults. So they don't know what it was. But I'm pretty sure it was one of the spirits of the children there that used to stay there. But this school is kind of built weird, too. It's on the side of, like, the elementary, and then there's a separate building for high schoolers. And that was in that building. And my science teacher, she said that one time her and her daughter were there. She was working after hours. She said nobody was there. And she said that she heard children laughing, like, running up and down the hall. And so she said that she went out and they look, and there was, like, nobody there at all. And so, like, maybe not too soon after that, like, she said she heard one of the lockers slam, like, so loud, and she heard kids laughing. After that, she said that her and her daughter, like, got up and ran and just didn't, like, go back. And she actually got in trouble because, you know, she was the only one in the building. She's supposed to lock up the school, but I guess it scared her that bad that she didn't lock up the building and she doesn't know what it was. So that's my story. Keep up the good work. I love the show. Bye.
