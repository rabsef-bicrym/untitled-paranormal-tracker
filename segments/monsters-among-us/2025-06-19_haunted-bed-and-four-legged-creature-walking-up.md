[Speaker C] Hey Derek. This is Rick from New Orleans. I was helping a friend of mine cut grass one time at a lady's house who had passed away. She passed away in her bed. I didn't know this. The bed was outside, they were going to give it away, so I said I would take it. Well, my mom had passed away about eight months prior to that. Well, I got the bed and within a week's time I would feel someone or something sit down on the right hand corner of the bed and depress by my feet. And at first it bothered me and then I said, well, it may be my mom, it may be the woman. And this went on for a while and it did not really bother me. Then it came to where it went away for a while, maybe six or eight months, then it came back. And each time it would happen my dresser drawers right near my head so I would hear like the slightest little tink of one of the handles and I would know that within 5 to 10 seconds and my bed would be moving. And this is not sleep paralysis. Something would sit down, then get up, then I would feel like a four legged creature walking up the bed and I would lift my head up and not see nothing. And then it would hold me down and it was so scary because I was trying to fight this thing. And finally I kind of came out of it and there was nothing there. And this happened about two or three more times. Then I put a blessed cross in my room. And that's been eight months and nothing since then. Love you show man. Take care.
