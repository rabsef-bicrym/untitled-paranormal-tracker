[Speaker D] Hello, this is Chevelle Gilmore from Billings, Montana. I just wanted to call about an entry I had a couple years ago. It happened when I was about six or five. It was when I was a child, but a long while ago. This at my grandma's house. And this is in a residential area, an area with a lot of buildings, just the general city area. But what's weird about this house is that it was built a long time ago. I did some digging and from what I do know, it was 1960s or 1970s, around that time. And I don't know, I always got a weird feeling from that place. There's always like pictures in that house that always kind of like stare at you. You know, the weird usual feeling you get. But this was about like believe it was in the afternoon. My dad and my grandma were just on the patio and I was in like downstairs in the basement. I heard this noise and I just kind of ignored it. I just figured it was the show because I was watching like a little creepy kid show, like Goosebumps or something, can't remember. But I heard this like dog bark and I got really scared, but I just kind of ignored it. And then I kept hearing it and it sounded like a dog, almost like barking in your ear. Like I could feel the heat on my ear. It was really weird. And when I asked my dad about it, he said he's seen like dogs outside the window before. Other people, shadow people. He has seen like the string get pulled almost as if like one of those string lights where you pull it. And what's weird is that it wasn't no pull. It was like you had to actually like grab it. And that's what I found so weird about it. So I love your show, absolutely love it. Thank you and bye.
