[Speaker C] Hi Derek, this is Caden. I live in Kansas, near the Missouri border. I was recently listening to the season 7 episode 19, grab bag episode fairly far behind, but it describes A disembodied hand. And it kind of brought up a memory that I had pushed away for a while because it pretty much Fs with my reality, if that makes sense. So I was in the car with two of my siblings, my younger brother and my younger sister, and I was driving them home from youth group. So this would have been probably eight or nine at night, pretty dark. And we were just driving down the highway and we were about to get on the exit ramp and I saw something in my headlights just in the middle of the exit ramp, very low to the ground. I couldn't quite make it out until we got up close to it. But as we got up close to it, I could see that it was a disembodied hand. And I had zero idea what I was looking at. I was completely dumbfounded. And I slow down and we literally have to wait for this thing to cross as it just walks in front of us across the exit ramp and into the ditch. And I mean, as you can imagine, my siblings and I just completely freaked out. We were just like, what in the hell was that? Was that a hand? We were just completely freaked out. We had no idea what was going on and we just drove away as if nothing happened. We never really brought it up to our parents or anything because, I mean, it's just the most ridiculous story you can imagine. So, yeah, that's my story. Thanks. Bye.
