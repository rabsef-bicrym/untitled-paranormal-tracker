[Speaker D] Hey, there, my name is Karen. I'm on the Baja Peninsula in lovely Mexico. I'm from San Francisco Francisco area. Lived here three years. Best decision I've ever made. Anyways, I remember you talking about the Ano Triangle. So back in 2008, I went camping in that beautiful part of the world with my sister and her husband. It was between Christmas and New Year's. We were on the way to San Felipe in Mexico. You know, we had a campfire and just hanging out, nothing fancy. I saw what I thought was a plane, like one that's coming towards you. Very, very bright light. I know this has been reported by other people many times. It, like, turned into, like, 20 little lights and they started zipping and zapping every which way. And then they'd go back to the center and make that one big light. And then they made a formation of, like, a line. And then they'd separate and go all different ways. But it was like, zip, zip, zip, zip, like, super fast. This was like before drones. And it was far enough away, it was looking west. It was my first time in that park. So I thought it was maybe the Air Force Base San Diego or something like that, but I've never heard of Technology like that. But I looked on the interwebs and actually saw some videos of the same phenomena. I don't remember where. I think it was other locations. But then I heard your podcast about the Anza Borrego Triangle or something.

[Speaker C] Yeah, I don't know.

[Speaker D] It was just very peculiar. Okay, be well. Bye.
