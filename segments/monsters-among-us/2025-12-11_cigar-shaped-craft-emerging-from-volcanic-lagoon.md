[Speaker F] Hi, my name is Maria, and I'm calling from central Florida. But this story actually belongs to my father, and it takes place in the country of Nicaragua. My father was about 12 years old, so this would have been around 1956. So it was a very long time ago. This occurred on a farm in Nicaragua that belonged to his family. So a lot of what would happen is when school would get out and they would go on vacation, a lot of, you know, my father's cousins, their parents would send them to his aunt's farm to go work and kind of spend vacation. And they would go and they'd do a lot of stuff on the farm. And on this one such day, he went out with a wagon and a mule. And one of the workers on the farm, who was an older gentleman, probably in his late 40s, and my father was 12 at the time. And they went out to the property. His aunt actually happened to own quite a large amount of land. And right next to the farm is a large, inactive volcano that has a lagoon inside in the middle. It's actually called Apoyeke. And they actually happen to own half of that volcano. And so they used that very fertile land to plant things. And they also used it for their cattle to graze, which is one of the main things that they had on the farm and on this day they took the wagon, they had to go up the side of the mountain up to the very top. I've actually visited it myself. Once you get to the very top, you can kind of look down you and you see a large lagoon in the middle, just like a lake, you know, very beautiful. So my father on that day, I would say was around the afternoon, early afternoon, there was still plenty of light and they were cutting plantains up there at the very top. And my father says that him and his companion saw a craft emerge from the water and kind of hover very quietly. It made absolutely no sound from what my father says. He said it was kind of cigar shaped and it kind of came out of the water, kind of hovered above, you know, almost at the top of the crater a little bit, and then just went right back down and went back in the water. And I think at the time, I don't Even know if UFOs were even a thing that people talked about, especially in a Latin American country in the 50s. They would have had a very limited amount of, you know, technology news. So my father is actually a very educated man. He's very well read, and he says to this day he's not found any kind of aircraft and books that would resemble what he saw. He says the closest thing in terms of behavior would be like a stealth aircraft. It kind of hovers quietly, doesn't really make a lot of sound. He says that's the closest thing in terms of behavior. But in terms of look, cigar shaped, all metal, no real markings, nothing to really identify where it was from. Several years later, I would say around the 70s, he did have a conversation with some military people from Nicaragua who he shared the story with. And they happened to mention that they had several other military people, you know, witness that sort of thing in and around the area, in some parts of Nicaragua. So they're not exactly sure. I'm not sure if it's some kind of like advanced aircraft that existed at the time, maybe belonging to the United States. Maybe they were concealing it, be looking for some rural areas to conceal it. I'm not sure that's entirely possible. I just know that him and his companion both witnessed that. And to this day, my father is not really sure what kind of craft that was. Thank you and keep up the good work. I really love your podcast and I'm glad I have a place to share all these crazy stories. Bye.
