[Speaker B] Hi, this is Lane from South Carolina. I called about seeing two alien big cats with my mother driving down the road. Well, I'm calling back because I was talking with some co workers about seeing these cats because I was wearing a Bigfoot jacket and they asked me about it and they asked if I've ever seen anything. Well, when I mentioned the two big cats I saw, one of my co workers said he's seen them too. And he's like, my dad even has a video of it. And I was like, really? And he's like, yeah, I'll show you. And he showed me and he told me his dad was sitting on the back porch. He noticed a something moving across the lake. It was right off of Lake Murray. So he had to zoom in a little bit. And because of that, the video is a little grainy, but I'm definitely gonna send that over to you. Before seeing these big cats, I didn't even know that people had seen them in South Carolina. And then when I saw them, all of a sudden people were like, yeah, no, they exist here. It baffles me because from the research I've done, DNR had to put out a statement that said there are no big cats. The only big cats in South Carolina are bobcats. It's just like DNR says, we don't have them, but quite a few people have seen them here. It's very weird. Well, I hope you can use this. Thank you so much. Have a wonderful day.
