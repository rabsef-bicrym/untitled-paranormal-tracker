[Speaker B] Hi, I'm calling from Ontario, Canada. I'll state anonymous My story has to do with the passing of my mom. She passed away in our home. She had cancer and she fought bravely for many months. But eventually she passed away on a hospital bed that we had downstairs in our living room. The night that she passed they ended up taking her to a type of morgue, but she had passed away and she stayed in the house for a little while. We had family come and pay their respects and so that night I ended up sleeping upstairs in her bed. I Just wanted to, I guess, feel close to her. So I went to sleep in her bed. Sometime there during the night, I got up and I went to the kitchen. And so to get to my kitchen, you had to go down some stairs and then to the left. When you finally got to the main floor, if you looked to the left, that was the living room. Straight ahead was the kitchen. And as I was passing the living room, I glanced over to the left and I saw what. I don't know how to describe it, but it was like a black mass. It was blacker than black. And it was just like this kind of a blob just there in the living room, right where she had passed, this dark, dark mass. And I remember looking at it and being like, okay, that's weird. And there were no lights on, but there was lights from the outside. And you know, you could kind of see the furniture and that. But that particular area was very dark. And I just kind of went to the kitchen, got something, I can't remember what. And I went back upstairs and actually just kind of went back to bed. At some point during the night, my brother wakes me up. Now, my brother slept in the basement. Wakes me up, scares the bejesus out of me. He's standing in the doorway. At this point, we're grown adults. And he says to me, I can't sleep, I can't sleep downstairs. I said, why? And he says to me, well, I can see like a black mass seeping down into my room, coming from above. And above his room and that he lived in the basement, was the living room. So he was seeing whatever I was seeing from below. Until very recently, I didn't know this, but we talked about it again. My mom passed about 11 years ago. And he told me when he saw that seeping down, he went upstairs and he went to the living room and looked same area that I was looking at. He told me that he not only saw darkness mass, but he could see like a sparkling, like a stardust swirling within that dark mass. He said that the feeling he got from wasn't good. He always felt like it could have been maybe some kind of opening of some kind of portal or something, but just mind boggling because I saw it and he saw it. Anyways. Love your show. Thank you.
