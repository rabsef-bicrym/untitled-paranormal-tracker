[Speaker B] Hi, Derek. This is Danny calling from St. Michael's Maryland. The one I'm about to describe doesn't take place here, but. So every year my girlfriend's family plans a backpacking trip out west somewhere. And we ended up in Washington at Mount Rainier national park this year. You know, it's kind of famous for its Bigfoot sightings and everything, so I'm always joking around with them like, oh, look out for Bigfoot. And this year, it was the first night we were there, I told everyone, hey, about like 10 o' clock or so, I'm gonna go out and take some pictures of the stars because it's. They're just beautiful at night out there. And so the spot I wanted to go take pictures at was a five or ten minute walk from camp. So I got up and nobody else was awake, of course. And so, okay, so threw on my headlamp and walked out, you know, just with my camera. That was really all I had on me. That and a tripod. As I'm walking, I'm thinking, okay, what's out here with me at night? Because I know that they have mountain lions out there. So I was kind of, you know, being leery then the black bears too, even though they're mainly active during the day. So as I was walking, I would shine my headlamp around in different directions, you know, just to make sure. And I was listening really closely to make sure I didn't hear anything moving. But the spot I wanted to take pictures, that was out in this clearing. We were camped in the woods. So I get to this clearing after 5, 10 minutes or so, and there was, you know, it was beautiful. But as I'm turning my headlamp around, I look up across this clearing and it's probably a good 30, 40 yards or so, I'd say. I swung my headlamp up across that field and where the wood line picks up on the other side, I see a pair of eyes staring back at me, reflecting kind of a yellowish color. And they turned and walked away. And I'm about 5 foot 11 or so, almost 6ft tall. And I would have to say this thing was at least as tall as me, probably a bit taller. It could have been a black bear. I really didn't see any shape of the figure or anything, but, you know, I immediately was like, oh, my God, maybe that was Bigfoot. And so I didn't stick around there for too long. I snapped a few shots and made my way back to camp and I told everyone else about it in the morning, but was kind of brushing it off like, oh, I think I saw a cougar or black bear last night or something. I didn't want them to think I was crazy, so I didn't even suggest Bigfoot. But yeah, that's. That's my one possible Bigfoot encounter. Yeah, just found your podcast about a month ago and I've been binging it ever since. I love it so much. So keep up the good work and I will keep on listening and calling back. I've got more stories. I think I live in a haunted house, so I've got plenty of those. But yeah, keep up the good work and thanks again. Bye.
