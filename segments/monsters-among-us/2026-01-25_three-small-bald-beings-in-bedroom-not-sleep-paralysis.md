[Speaker B] Hey, Derek, my name is Jay. This story happened when I was 16 or 17. I grew up about 45 minutes east of Cincinnati in southern Ohio. And it was a super small town and we lived on the outskirts of of it, so it was even more kind of desolate. So the house I grew up in was just like a typical ranch style house surrounded by woods. There was essentially no light pollution. Your neighbors were forever away. And my bedroom was on the back left corner of the house, kind of facing the woods. So I always slept with my TV on in my bedroom, but had it muted. It was more or less like a, I don't know, like a nightlight for me. It was mounted on the wall like opposite my bed and maybe four and a half feet off of the ground. And on this particular night I had laid down and was having trouble falling asleep. You know, I was in high school and had to go to school early in the morning. And so I was having a hard time falling asleep. So I sat up and kind of opened my eyes just to readjust in the bed. When I opened up my eyes, I looked over at my tv, which was on but muted. I saw these three things standing in front of my tv. And since the TV was behind them, they were just kind of like silhouetted in the light. And a little description about them, they were different heights. The one in the middle was like the tallest and it came up to maybe about halfway up the tv. So we'll say like four feet. The one to its left was maybe two inches shorter than the one in the middle. And then the one to its right was maybe an inch shorter than that. So they were all three different heights. And they were standing in front of the TV silhouetted. And I know it sounds like pretty cliche, but what I saw was that they were all like, they were completely bald. Like completely bald. Their arms were down, like to their sides, which I could see silhouette from the TV behind them. And they had pretty, like long fingers that went down to maybe before where you would expect a knee to be. They're super skinny. I couldn't see their faces, like I said, but I could see their movements. You know how like when someone is standing, they don't stand completely still. You know, they're not a statue. They kind of make little movements with their fingers or maybe sway just a little bit. I mean, that's exactly what they were doing. It looks like very organic, something that was tangible, you know, right there in front of me. And they were just staring at me. They didn't say anything. I didn't, you know, I hear all these stories, be able to telepathic, you know, communicate. I didn't hear anything. They were staring at me, and I was completely frozen. I was just terrified. I didn't know what to do. And I could barely move because I was freaking out. And all I could do in that moment was sort of release my stomach muscles to fall back into my pillow. And I stayed awake the entire night just staring at my ceiling and just get petrified because I didn't know what was happening. I couldn't do. Like, I was. So they were like. And to get to my door out of my bedroom, you would have had to go right past them. And there was no way I was going to go anywhere near where they were. And so by the time I got enough up, like, enough courage to look over in that direction again, it was maybe an hour or so later, they were gone. They weren't there. TV was still running in the background. It was probably some infomercial. And they were gone. And so I went to school the next day. I exhausted and still petrified from the night before. And so I kept pretty silent, you know, for a few days. I did not want to talk because it sounded crazy, totally crazy. And then I had overheard a friend a few days later telling another friend of mine about something that had happened to him a few days prior. He was in his bedroom after school and glanced over out his window and he said he saw something that he. He could only describe as, like, alien, like, looking back at him from, like, the big tree in his backyard. And I hadn't said anything about what had happened to me or whatever, but the way he was describing it, it sounded exactly like the things that I saw in my room that were just staring at me. I mean, I. This is. I'm not. I don't. You know, I'm very realistic and blah, blah, blah. If. If it were sleep paralysis, I would have definitely known it were. I would have chalked it up to sleep paralysis. Like, I have not beyond. I wouldn't put that. You know, like, if that happened, I guarantee I'd be like, okay, that's what it was. Anything to make it seem less scary than it actually was. But the dynamics. And I thought it. I'm like, what was it? And the dynamics of it were so not what I've heard about sleep. I mean, this is something I was very awake for. I wasn't even a sleep yet. And I was sitting up. I was looking at these things. Anyway, I've told some close friends about this. Friends for years. And at first they were like, okay, but now they're like, okay, that was really freaky. And there was just some spooky stuff that happened, you know, out on that side of Cincinnati, if you can even call it that. I mean, it's like 45 minutes away. But regardless, I hope I hear this on the show. I appreciate it. Thanks.
