[Speaker B] Hi, Derek. This is Vic from southwest Minnesota. And my story happened in 2012. Kind of sad story, but my sister was dying of cancer and I was up probably 4 hour trip away to visit her her last days. I got there the day before she passed away. Anyway, she still could hear and chat a little bit. And then the very next day my other sister and I were there and she passed away. So when I left, finally I got out in my car, which was a brand new car, relatively new, maybe a year old. And I always had listened to the radio, but when I started my car, I got this static, just total static. And I thought, well, this is strange. Why is all this static? It just, I couldn't tune anything in. Well, eventually when I got going, I could listen to the radio music again and stuff. And on my trip home, of course, she was on my mind the whole time. And I pull up in my driveway and I live on a farm and to my left is the house and there's a porch, and it was an unfinished porch at the time. And she was standing there waving at me. And I knew it was her because she had this tie dye T shirt that she loved to wear. And it just totally caught my eye. And then I was looking up the driveway again and then I looked again and she was gone. I truly believe that her spirit or her energy was in the car with me. When I started the car and the radio gave me all kinds of static, I think that was her spirit or her energy, I guess. And she came all the way home with me and waved goodbye to me on my porch. That's my story. Keep it spooky. I love the podcast.
