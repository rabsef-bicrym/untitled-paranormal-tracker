[Speaker B] Hey, this is my first time calling in. This is not my story, but my brother's story. This is in Michigan, outside Bangor. Essentially, my brother and my sister were both at home. Civil light trailer. My dad made some modifications to it. Essentially, my brother's washing dishes in the kitchen. He's facing out and away from the hallway that connects to the other two bedrooms in the bathroom. Basically, the hallway is behind him and to his right. He's doing the dishes, looking out, and my sister comes out, says, hey, I'm gonna go down the street and help the neighbor with their animals. He's like, okay. And it's a while later when he's continuing to do the dishes when from the hallway, he hears, christian, come here. And he goes, no, you come here. My hands are wet. I'm doing dishes. Christian, come here. And from what I remember, this goes back and forth for a second before the realization hits him that she's not back there. She's over at the neighbors helping them with their animals. And he freaks out, you know, gets the hell out of here and goes down to the neighbors to confirm that she's actually over there. Good show. I honestly hope to hear this while I'm at work someday. See ya.
