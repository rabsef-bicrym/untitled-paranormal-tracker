[Speaker I] Hey Derek, I just found out about your podcast and listening to it for the past couple weeks and I want to remain anonymous on this one. I've had a few weird things happen to me and I've still never really made sense of it. Okay, this happened around maybe 15 years, 15 or so years ago. I live in Chicago and I'm a night out, so I stay up all night. So what I usually do is I lay on the couch and watch tv. So it's normal for me to fall asleep on the couch, wake up, and, you know, just continue to watch TV or go upstairs my room. So one morning, well, one night I was asleep on the couch and I just jolted up, woke up, and the TV turned off and turned on, on its on. So I was like, okay, this is weird. So I grabbed the remote, turned it back on, and it turned off. And then I was like, okay, what's going on? Is it the cable? What's going on? The cable box. So I turned the TV on again and it turned it back off. Like, wait, this is crazy. So I got up, I turned all the lights on because I was just trying to get up and get my bearings about me and my older brother who was living most of the time. He ran downstairs like, did you hear that? And I go, what are you talking about? He was like, something just flew over the house. And I was like, what? He was like, you didn't hear that? He. He opened up the front curtains and it Was like maybe two or three o' clock in the morning. It was in the summertime. So he opened the curtain and he was like, something was directly, like, over the house. Flew over the house. And it was just. It was just a weird vibe in house. And the thing about it was we live, like in a vicinity near an airport, so we know, like airplanes, you know, flying over. So my mother was like, no, this wasn't an airplane. Something was literally over the house and it flew over. It's like, I heard it. It was like directly over the house. So a few minutes later, my mother, she opened the door from her room because their bedroom is like. It's the living room, the dining room, and then it's her bedroom. And she opened the door, she was like, what's going on? We were like, what are you talking about? She was like, it's just a weird vibe in air.

[Speaker G] What is going on?

[Speaker I] She was like, it's just weird. And then we were telling her what happened, and she was like, something like, I just don't. I just feel weird. I can't get back to sleep. And I felt the same way. It felt like some. Some kind of was in the house.

[Speaker G] It was just weird.

[Speaker I] And it just felt like the air was just like static. It was like a static charge in the air.

[Speaker G] It was just.

[Speaker I] It was just static electricity. It was just a real heavy feeling. And then after maybe about 30 minutes or so, it subsided. Like I said, we still talk about to this day. We still can't make sense of it all. And I just wanted to know, like, what happened, like. And like I said, that's not the first experience I've had in this house. I've had a few experiences that I can't explain. And, you know, listen to your podcast just made me really start reliving these and thinking about these. And I just want to say, you know, keep up the good work. I love your podcast. I've been listening to it every single day on my way to work before I go to bed, you know, and I may call back again because I have a few, few more stories like this. Yeah, but it was just. Just a weird vibe. All right, thanks, Derek. Have a good day.
