[Speaker B] Hi Derek, this is brandon from Aliquippa, Pennsylvania. About 30 minutes north of Pittsburgh, I'd say. And this particular story took place in Grove City, Pennsylvania, which is about another hour away. I was out doing A delivery for work, bringing a pallet of stuff out for customers in our work pickup truck. And it was a clear day, really hot for what it should have been, you know, that time of year. And this was maybe a month or so ago. And as I get to the customer and get unloaded, the guy comes out on a forklift and a couple other guys come out with him just to chat. And the guy on the fork forklift asks us, yo, do you guys see that over there? And starts pointing over to the road. And we're all like, no, what? And as soon as I turn and look, there's a guy in full hazmat garb, like neon yellow, like stereotypical rainbow colored hazmat suit with like thick winter gloves and thick winter boots. And he was wearing like one of those N95 face masks too. So the only thing you could really see on this guy were his eyes. And he was almost abnormally tall, like well over six foot something. And he just looked so out of place and so off. Even the way he was walking, it looked like he didn't really know how. And his arms were moving in a really exaggerated motion. It almost looked like he was dancing while he was walking is the best way I can describe it. And as he's doing this weird dance walk, a kid comes up from the opposite direction of him on a bicycle. And he stops the kid and has like a little chat with them and then, you know, sends the kid on his way. And I'm just, you know, in a trance just staring at this guy, seeing what he's gonna do. And one of the other guys that was helping unload my truck asked if he knew that guy. Like he yelled at the guy like, hey, make sure someone knows him. And the dude in the hazmat suit just kept walking. And then he eventually stops and sees me and gives this like really exaggerated, like full arm wave at me before walking away. And I could kind of tell that he was smiling really big under that face mask. Like his eyes looked like they were scrunched up like you would if you were giving a really big grin at somebody. And he just kept walking. And the way this warehouse I was at was positioned is that there's the security shack right at the entrance, but other than that you can see the road just fine. And it's almost a one way road. There's no way that you can, you know, lose someone. If you're looking at that road, there's not really anything intersecting, no woods or anything. It's perfectly clear. And the guard Sack, maybe blocks. Only about 10ft of vision. But as he walks past this guard shack, he just vanishes. And I sit there for another minute or so, just looking, waiting for him, you know, to pop out on the other side or something, and he never does. And I even kind of took a lap around the building, going towards the security shack to look again, and he was gone. It was like there wasn't even a trace of him. And I know it wasn't any kind of trick or illusion, because at least three or four other men other than myself, you know, saw it, too. And I just have no idea what it could have been. But I've done research on, you know, paranormal entities, and I know that southwest Pennsylvania and parts of Ohio are kind of hot spots for possible extraterrestrial encounters and activity. And Pennsylvania also isn't too far off from where sightings of the Grinning man phenomenon have occurred. The only thing that rules out the Grinning man for me, though, is that you couldn't see the grin itself. Unless he was trying to disguise himself even more. Or maybe he was interdimensional and kind of just clipped in and out for a minute. I don't know. But the thing was really off putting. All of us were weirded out by it, and I even had this kind of sense of dread in the pit of my stomach just looking at this guy. Like, I had the feeling that whatever this guy was, he wasn't supposed to be here. That's my story. Thank you so much for the podcast. I love and enjoy listening to it, and I hope everyone stays spooky out there.
