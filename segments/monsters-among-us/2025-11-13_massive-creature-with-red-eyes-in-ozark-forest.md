[Speaker C] Hey Derek. This story takes place in northwest Arkansas, on the border of Arkansas and Oklahoma, in the Weddington part of the Ozark National Forest where Lake Weddington and the Illinois river meet. One night I was stopped along a national park road there, the only place I could get a signal so I could answer some emails. And in doing so I had just sat there for about 45 minutes with my headlights turned off and the running lights on to the vehicle, creating just about a hundred foot pool of light in front of me. And I was going through my emails and I noticed in front of me what looked like two red lights like you would see on the back of a fishing trailer to a small flat bottom fishing boat kind of a small trailer. And they were right along the ground, right along the road, right in front of me, just outside of this circle of light about a hundred feet. And as soon as I noticed them they did this kind of wavy motion that made me think it was a person's head, but they were so far apart there's no way it could have been someone's head. As soon as I looked at began to back away and rise up. So if you could imagine someone was laying on Their belly crawling towards the headlights. And then once they saw me recognize them, they began to back away and sort of stand up. And these red. Two red dim circles that, you know, looked like kind of reflectors that you would put on a fence post or a mailbox. About as far apart As a small boat trailer. They kept rising up as they went backward. Until they were probably 10ft off the ground. They were so high, they looked like they were part of a tractor trailer. And I was transfixed by it. I didn't know what I was seeing. I kept thinking, I'm about to see something. Something is about to come right into the light. I'm about to see something. And I never did. I sat there for about a minute, like, in a daze, Literally, not knowing, you know, what I had seen. I turned on my headlights after about a minute and drove away. I didn't have the presence of mind to look for any footprints or anything. And I didn't go back through there for months. It didn't necessarily scare me, but the fact that it put me in kind of a daze Where I wasn't able to make a decision. I remember thinking, what am I seeing? I'm about to see something. And should I lock the doors? At the same time, thinking, this thing is so big that it really wouldn't matter if I lock the doors. So I don't know what I saw, if it was sasquatch or. It seemed like something kind of a scale, Slightly larger than that, you know, it was pretty big. Anyway, that's my story. Love the show. Hope you can use it. Thanks.
