[Speaker D] Hi Derek, this is Kai in Washington. I'm so sorry to call you from.

[Speaker E] My truck, but I think I'm looking.

[Speaker D] At a UFO right now.

[Speaker E] It is 6:50 in the morning and I'm going south on I5. I travel from Bellingham down to Seattle and I am here. Exit. Oh man, I don't know, but there's this like giant star in front of me and I was looking at it and there's another one slightly down to the left of it. And I thought, oh, it's two planets, I wonder which ones they are. And then the lower left one, it just like faded out and then completely disappeared. I'm like, oh, weird because it was so bright.

[Speaker D] But now it came back and it's like all flickery and kind of moves up next to the. I think it's a planet. I want to say it's Venus. Yeah, as I'm taking this little turn.

[Speaker E] I'm realizing that is the east over there and that's where Venus is.

[Speaker D] I don't know if there's another planet aligned with it, but the lower it.

[Speaker E] Just keeps disappearing and reappearing and it's not too cloudy right now. Oh cool, never mind. They both actually just disappeared. Nevermind. Whack. I have no idea what I'm looking at, but okay, I'm gonna go back to driving. Thank you.
