[Speaker F] What's up, Derek? My name's Sam. I live in Southern Indiana. I guess this was like a ghost shadow person. I guess I want to say I was probably in fifth or sixth grade, maybe fourth grade. I was like, just getting old enough to stay home alone by myself for extended periods. Of time, like a whole day or something. And I remember I was home alone. I was on Christmas break at my dad's house. And I was downstairs in our living room. I was playing video games or something. And all of a sudden, I hear footsteps. Directly above the living room was my dad's bedroom. And I hear footsteps upstairs. Not a dragging, not just a thumping. It's like, heel, toe, heel, toe, heel, toe. And I hear it walking around what sounds like my dad's bed. And I could just hear it walking around. And I listened to it take a few laps. I was trying not to freak out, trying to justify it, explain it. So I go upstairs. Eventually, it doesn't stop. So you walk straight up the stairs, and to your right is a door, immediately. And then you turn to your left and you take a couple steps, and there's my dad's bedroom door. And the bedroom door is open. And I come up the stairs, and I, like, kind of peek over that little wall into my dad's room. And I see just like. It didn't have the shape of a person. It was just like a darkish mist. I could see through it pretty well, but, like, you could tell it was there. It looked like, I want to say, like a mesh jersey or something almost. It was on the far side of my dad's bed, and it was finishing the lap that it was taking. Like I said, it was walking around my dad's bed, and it started coming back around towards me. So, like, from the far side to the foot of the bed and coming my way, and it just kind of vanished out of thin air. I told my dad about it. He had lived in this house since he was a kid, and he told me that he had always heard, like, kind of footsteps and just weird noises in the night. But he didn't believe in ghosts. But he had definitely heard some weird stuff in the house. Something else happened to me, and this time my dad was home whenever it happened. Like I said, my dad's bedroom was right above the living room. And one time, me and my dad were sitting in the living room, and my dad, I don't know, his phone was charging in his room or something. He asked me to go upstairs and get it for him. Well, when I did that, I start walking up the stairs. And like I said in my last story, so you walk up these stairs, and there is a door immediately to your right, right at the top of the stairs. So I get about halfway up the stairs, and this door is standing probably about three quarters of the way open. And I am heading up the stairs and this door just slams shut. We had a chandelier down in the dining room. Like just a janky little old chandelier. And it rattled the chandelier. It rattled the house. I ran back downstairs and my dad immediately said, what the hell was that? So he heard it, I heard it. I saw it slam shut. Me and my dad were the only ones home. He went up in the room. The window wasn't open. I mean, there could have been a draft, but there's not a draft hard enough to slam this door as hard as it slams. Didn't really have an explanation for that one either. So thank you for giving me time to share. Thank you for the podcast. I've been listening for about a year now as they come out, and I have gone back and listened to pretty much all of them and haven't found a bad one yet. Keep up the good work, Derek. Thank you.
