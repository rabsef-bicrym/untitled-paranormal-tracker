[Speaker C] Hi, I'm calling in anonymously from Wisconsin. This story actually just happened last night, so it's pretty fresh in my mind, still pretty shaken up about it. So my husband and I and our animals, we live in an old farmhouse and we've been here since about 2015 and even just prior to moving in. And since we've been here, we've had a lot of different activity within the house. We've seen ghosts, we've felt ghosts. We've felt ghosts in the different outbuildings and barn and things like that, and had some funny things happening. Nothing too scary. Last night was different for sure. So I'll start off by saying that I had had an experience during the early morning hours and my husband had an experience in the earlier part of the night. But I didn't know that until I talked to him this morning. So I'll start with what happened with him. So he had fallen asleep in the recliner in the living room and he woke up at about 11:30pm and he looked over and he saw a dark figure that was crouched on the floor, almost like you would think a dog would be sitting. And interestingly, we have a all black dog. So he looks over and he says, oh, hey buddy, you know, and it says our dog's name. And the figure doesn't move, it doesn't make a sound, it doesn't interact with him, but he can see its eyes. And it continues to just sit there and stare at him. And at this point his heart drops and he's like, what the heck is that? And it just suddenly disperses into the air and completely disappears. At that point he's freaked out and he gets up and he comes into the bedroom where I am sleeping with our black dog. We sleep just fine the rest of the night. He gets up at 3:30 to go to work and when he leaves he had let the dog out. So the dog ends up just staying in the living room and I go back to sleep in the bedroom by myself, which is unusual. Usually we have one of the animals in there with us, but I was in there alone and I fall back asleep and I wake up and I look over to my right, which is where my husband would normally be sleeping. However, he's at work and there's a dark figure that is crouched on the bed staring at me. Now I've had sleep paralysis in the past and I kind of know what that looks like for me. Typically I'll have episodes where it'll be a dark figure in the corner of the bedroom or at the foot of the bed. I've never had one that is that close to me before. And then I've also never had one that touched me before. And this figure did. So it's staring at me and I can feel my heart racing. And it puts its hands around my neck and I can feel the pressure of it pushing on my neck. And it. The feeling of doom and absolute just evil is just. It just is everywhere. It's all around me. And then all of a sudden it lets go and it jumps up and it scampers across the back of the headboard behind me. I can hear its claws like A little raccoon or something, just scampering. And then it leaves the room and then it's gone and everything's over just like that. And I lay there for a minute, and in my head I'm thinking, is this sleep paralysis? It must be. But wait a minute. I've never had anything touch me. It's never been that interactive before. And it just seems so much clearer and real than what my normal sleep paralysis episodes are like. And I haven't had one in probably six months to a year. There was a period of time where I was having them fairly frequently, but it's been a very long time for me anyways, that I haven't had one at this point. After this figure had attacked me. I didn't know that my husband had also encountered this figure the same night, but in the living room. So I called him on his early break and was just kind of checking in to see how he was feeling because he was saying that he was starting to feel maybe like he was getting a cold or something. And I just called and I was like, hey, you know, last night I think I had a sleep paralysis episode again. But I said it was different because, you know, this thing put its hands around me. I could feel the pressure of it pushing on my neck. I couldn't breathe. And then I could hear it scampering behind me. And he paused and he said, well, last night I saw this figure, you know, in the living room. So it's just. It's definitely something dark. You know, we've never had anything that felt this evil in our home before. And we've had a lot of spirit activity. Both my husband and I, they're definitely kind of keen into those things. In fact, he tends to have more things to happen to him than I do. So my plan today is to clean the house real good and do a really good smoke cleanse and sound cleanse, and I'll even do a salt cleanse, too. But I definitely don't want this thing in my house anymore, whatever it is. And maybe it was just sleep paralysis, but I feel like it would be unusual for both my husband and I to see the same entity or creature or whatever it was on the same night in two different locations. I also think it's interesting that we saw this thing when we were both alone. That's a little bit unsettling. So anyways, I hope to get rid of this thing. So that's my plan today, is to work on getting whatever it is out of my house. Take care.
