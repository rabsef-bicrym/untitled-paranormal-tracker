[Speaker D] Hi, Derek. My name is Rebecca. I'm calling from Amanda, Ohio. I am out in the woods. My story starts off with a couple years ago, I purchased a couple miniature horses. They live in the barn that's probably about 12 yards from my house. I have a camera set up in the barn that I can see up here what's going on down there. And I periodically look at it. I looked at it one day and I seen a weird black shadow back in the corner of the barn. It was weird. It was just a dark shadow. I didn't ever notice it before. My husband got home from work and I had mentioned it to him. Very next day, I look in the monitor and the shadow's back. But it's really, really. It's a black mass about maybe 7 foot tall, maybe 3 foot across, big black mass. And it's just standing there staring at the horses. Or it didn't have any eyes that I could stare, but it was facing in that direction, looking over them. My husband, I hollered for him, like, it's back, it's back. Come look at it. And I. I didn't know what I was seeing. So we're standing there. And then I hollered for my son, he's in his 20s. And I hollered, you know, come on down here. And as soon as I hollered, come on down here. Look at this. The mass changed into a little ball. It zipped all around the barn and it shot around. As soon as I yelled, it shot around and looked directly at the camera, at us. And then it was zipping all around and it zipped right out the barn. I have no idea what I've seen, and I never got any creepy feelings in my barn. It's a happy place, and I haven't seen it since. I wish that I would. And I went down there and tried to put out the energy, you know, show me what you are. If you have any insight what it could have possibly been, I would love to hear your feedback. I hope that you can use my story. And thank you so much. Bye bye.
