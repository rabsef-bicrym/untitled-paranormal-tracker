[Speaker B] Hi, my name is Susie and I am from Canada. And about 12 years ago I bought a house in Barrie and it was a really, really old house. And apparently it was like a farmhouse for an apple orchard. So I moved in and I lived by myself and just my dog. The first night I went to sleep, I was woken up about 3am to a screaming baby. I don't have children and there was no reason that there was a baby screaming in my house. So I went back to sleep. And the next day I walked around the house and I just told the house, I'm here. I'm not here to bother you or disturb you. Let's just live together. And I never told anybody about that because it felt pretty strange. And then I decided about four years later to sell the house. But as I was moving out, my best friend and my boyfriend were helping me move. And they both said basically at the same time, thank God you're getting out of here, it's haunted. And I said, what are you talking about. And they both described the exact same thing, that there was like this little orb that would go in and out and around my couch and go into different places. And I obviously never saw that. But these two people, they didn't know each other at all until the day of moving because one was from another country. But they both had the exact same experience in my house. So I don't know if it was the baby, but I did ask my neighbor when I was moving that day to come over and have a drink. And he said, well, at one point there was a swimming pool in your backyard and a 15 year old boy was being bullied and being beaten up and thrown in the pool and ended up on life support and eventually died unfortunately. And then they cemented the whole backyard and put grass over the pool. But at the same time, that's not what I heard with the baby screaming. It was like a baby, baby screaming. So anyways, that's my story. Thank you.
