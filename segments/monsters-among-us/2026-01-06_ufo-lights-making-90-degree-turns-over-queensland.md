[Speaker B] Hi Josephine here from Australia. I've been listening to your podcast for quite some time and I absolutely love it, but I've never called in before so this is my first. And to start off with, I wanted to back up someone else's story. I saw a very similar thing to a man who called in on season 12 episode 2, which I was just listening to listening to. He said that he saw some lights in the sky that he thought were UFOs and what he described was exactly the same to what I have seen here in Queensland, Australia. Only about three weeks ago I was outside at night, probably 8pm and I was just laying down watching the stars, watching satellites going past as I do quite often. So I know the difference between planes, helicopters, satellites, and being in the outback. It's quite clear there's not a lot of light pollution. And I saw exactly what he saw. These lights that were not aircraft, they would zip across the sky and then at 90 degree angles they would change to their direction. And there are about three of them on that night. Anyway, have a great night. I love your podcast and I'll call back with a few more stories.
