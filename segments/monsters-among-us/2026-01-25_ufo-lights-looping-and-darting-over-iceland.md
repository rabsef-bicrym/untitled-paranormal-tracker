[Speaker C] Hey Derek, Hope all as well. This is Dave calling from Long Island, New York. I've called in once before about my parents house, but this one's a little bit different. So this call is about UFO that I saw in Iceland around August of 2016. So I was on vacation with my girlfriend at the time. We were in Reykjavik. We stayed in the city for two nights and it was a beautiful place, really nice. And then we had a few nights in the countryside which we stayed in the farmhouse. And it was the only farmhouse within, I think it was like 10 miles. So it was a very open area, very rural, you know, a lot of hills and a lot of streams. So it was like our second night there. My girlfriend wanted to go out and smoke a cigarette. So we went outside, we were hanging out and they had this kind of, you know, couch area outside by the farmhouse that we were sitting at. And we were just hanging out, she was smoking, we were just talking, looking up at the stars. And we saw what I thought first was a satellite. It looked like, you know, a glowing star moving across the sky. So I was like, oh, check that out, it's a satellite. So we were both checking it out for a little bit and then it started changing direction and moving from one area to the other area, going up, looping around, it was very strange. And then we were watching that and a second one came and started following it, doing the same exact motions. It was looping around the sky and there were just these little dots, they look like stars and they were just moving in such a way that, you know, that I could not explain or figure out what they could possibly be. And as soon as they were there, they were gone and they just zipped off and disappeared into the night sky. And to this day I still have no idea what it could possibly be. But you know, it's something unexplained for sure. Anyway, thank you. I love the show. I'm a huge fan and I hope this is something you can use. Right. Have a great day.
