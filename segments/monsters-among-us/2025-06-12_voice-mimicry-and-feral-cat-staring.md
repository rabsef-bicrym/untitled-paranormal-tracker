[Speaker D] Hi, this is Kat from Indiana. I was just listening to the 13.5 episode of season eight. It had a lot of disembodied voices stories. I wanted to tell you the story of what happened to me one time. Where I live, it's a trailer park between a couple cornfields in middle Indiana. My friends whom I live with, they take care of the stray cats. They will catch them, vet them, fix them, and then release them back into the trailer park. Anyways, I was at home and me and my daughter were just watching TV and I hear a commotion outside, sounding like a couple of kids up to no good were chasing and harassing the stray cats. So I jump up off the couch and my daughter, she starts asking, what are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing? Don't, don't, don't. And I just like shush the kids. They're chasing the cats and you know how the cats get. So I bust out of the door trying to scare these kids, trying to tell them, you know, hey, leave these cats alone. They're not doing anything to you. Leave them alone. And there's no kids. There's no kids out on the road. There's one cat just sitting on the porch and this cat, we call him Socks, he's just sitting there looking at me. And as I'm putting this into my head, my daughter, she is physically grabbing me from around the collar of my shirt and dragging me back inside saying, what are you doing? What are you doing? Get back inside, get back inside. And I didn't know why she was manhandling me like this. My 15 year old daughter manhandling me back inside. And she slams the door shut. I'm like, what are you doing? Why did you do that? I was trying to make sure the cats were okay. And she's like, no. I heard you outside saying very clearly, come here, come here. And you popped up and ran outside. And I said, that's not what I heard. I heard A couple of kids chasing and yelling and screaming outside like kids will heal. And then it hits in my mind that this obviously feral cat that only likes like one or two people was just calmly sitting on our porch after I busted like the Kool Aid man through our front door. And it really rubbed me the wrong way that he never sits still like that. I've seen him around that house for two years now. He never sits still like that. To this day, I tell my friends, I'm like, don't let that cat inside. Do not let that cat inside. He gives me the crates. There's just something wrong about him. I don't know what it was. There's a lot of things that go on at that trailer park. Just weird, weird things. But that was one of my weird ones. I've been wanting to tell this story for a while. Love to hear your opinion on it. Alright, have a good one. Bye.
