[Speaker G] Hey, this is Gavin. I live in Atlanta. I've called in a few times with different ghost stories, but this one is a little bit different. I wasn't actually planning on calling and telling this story because I don't know if it fits exactly your podcast, but I heard a girl this week actually say something, tell something familiar or close to it with. It's like a deja vu story or something like that of her seeing something that happened in her dreams. I don't get anything like that, but throughout my life I've gotten. I guess you'd call it just typical deja vu, except it's a little bit more intense, it feels like for me. And it's repeated over and over again of different times. Mostly it's normally pictures of just something that happens and it may not necessarily happen that day. It may be days from then. A lot of times it's so mundane that I just. I forget the. Whatever I saw. But whenever it, whenever it happens, it just rushes all back like a. Like I get hit with a brick in the head.

[Speaker C] So it's.

[Speaker G] A lot of times it's just like hanging out with friends. And then all of a sudden a scene will happen just like I've never been to this place before. And just bam. It just. I was like, I saw this. And other times I'll remember it and I'll recall it. The most extreme time that I ever had, I think, was I was out of town going. I was actually signing up for the Marines at the time. And I was on the bus headed out and we, we were going between some hotels to stay the night.

[Speaker C] This is good.

[Speaker G] Not actually going. We're going to the neps where you go to get tested and everything like that. And we're going to hotels and I've never been to this area before. And I'm just staring outside the window of the bus. We come up between three hotels that I've never been to. And I can see. It's like a. It was like a gift in my head that I saw in this dream. And I could just see myself, the bus driving over this hill and seeing the hotel's kind of like, peak and just happens over and over again. And I don't know, maybe. Maybe it's not fit for this podcast, but that's. It just reminded me, hearing her story, and I thought it was weird. And I don't know if anybody else has these kind of things, but thanks for listening.
