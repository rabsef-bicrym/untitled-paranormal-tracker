[Speaker E] Hello, this is James from California. I had a episode where it's kind of a weird dream slash memory. I can't really place what exactly where exactly it is because there's some pieces about that's rather interesting, but the way I can remember it, it kind of feels like it might be a dream. So I'm not sure if it actually did happen or not. It's just what happened in the dream that's quite peculiar about it that I keep thinking back to. It was back when I was living with my parents, I believe around high school or so it must have been, because the fact of where the bed Was placed. And the view I had looking out the window at that time, the bed was in place. And looking out the window, it would have meant that I could see the back porch and also the steps going up to the backyard. And in this image was basically three beings. They were walking down the stairs completely, completely in unison. It was like in lockstep, kind of like the mirror men that's been that some people have reported seeing. And the three of them were going down these steps towards the back porch of my house, all looking down. They all had their hands on their sides. And the movement of the walking steps they were making was not just in lock step, but they're also kind of robotic in a ways. It was like the feet would end up snapping down to the next step below them. So the foot would kind of lift.

[Speaker D] Off a little bit.

[Speaker E] And then it would seem like it's pretty smooth, slow start. And then it would just kind of snap down to the next step as they went from one step down to the next step, step. And the rest of their body did not seem to really move or adjust at all. Kind of like a normal walking stance going downstairs. And they were spaced apart from each other. It felt very like drone like or very robotic like. The three of them walking down together. They had rather large gray heads, which makes me think it was the gray aliens. And the other thing that was very interesting about it that made this dream.

[Speaker D] Very.

[Speaker E] Clear is the fact that they were wearing clothes. And I did not actually start to look into the interest of aliens and alien abduction for quite some time after that. But this memory came with them wearing clothes. And I found that concept that they were wearing clothes to be just completely out of, out of the ordinary, very unorthodox. And it wasn't until much later on when I started reading books and find out that other people reported them from time to time wearing clothes too. So the clothes that they were wearing was blue clothes, as some people have described them, wearing overalls. That got a really good look at them up close. I couldn't tell if they're wearing overalls or not because they're kind of off in the distance. It was dark out. There wasn't any sort of bright lights. It was kind of being lit up by moonlight from what I could see. But I remember it was like this dark blue clothes, kind of like a jumpsuit, kind of like a mechanic would wear. But they weren't loose and baggy.

[Speaker D] It was.

[Speaker E] I don't know, kind of along the lines of what, what type to your tight to the body kind of like what a sport bike rider would wear. It was kind of like a leather jacket and leather pants, and they were tightly to the body, tightly wrapping around the body. So. And it seemed like they might have had some pockets in them, possibly maybe a collar, like a silver collar of some sort. I remember seeing a silver collar in these images in the image, and all three of them were wearing the same exact thing. And like I said, they're just walking and step down towards the back porch. I don't recall anything beyond that. The image just basically stopped there. I've just seen the three of them walking in unison down the steps to my back porch. And that was basically it for the entire memory of it. Hope this helps you out. Bye.
