[Speaker D] Hi, Colin from southern colorado. Got a crazy kind of cool story. My friend lives over here in the town we live on, on the south end of town and just went over her house one night. We just had a movie night. You know, we're watching the mandalorian on Disney plus. So we all stayed at the house. There's extra bedrooms, so me and my friend passed on the couch. And then everybody went to bed. And even her brother and his wife and their little boy went to bed, you know, and they had a separate room. And I'm sitting there on the couch and my buddy's passed out. And next thing you know, I hear little kid voices and footsteps running past the couch. And I'm like, her nephew is asleep. And I started hearing little kid voices and laughing and giggling. Honestly, I thought I heard a playground. And I'm like, well, you're just losing your mind Because I live right across the street from a school. It's just kids, you know, I'm just like, whatever. But then I open my eyes, I realize it's 2:30 in the morning and that's all I heard. And these footsteps going back and forth and it's like little feet. Yeah, you know, I was just really freaked out. So next morning I get up, I tell my friend, she's like, you bring it. You're just crazy. And I turn to my friend that's next to me, you know, the next day, I'm like, hey, what's crazy is our kid voice in little footsteps. And he looks at me dead serious. He goes, well, I didn't want to sound crazy, but I know what you were talking about. I heard it. I heard the little footsteps and the kids playing outside like it was a playground. And he goes, when I woke up, it was 2:45. And he goes, I was watching you watch that. And I was just pretending I was sleeping. I go, I'm not crazy. I'm like. He goes, no. I was like, all right, whatever. So a week goes by. We do it again. My friend doesn't show up until a little bit later that night because he's kind of freaked out. He's like, well, I don't want to go over there. So we do the same thing again. Everybody goes upstairs. E guy actually goes upstairs in the extra spare bedroom. So I'm sitting there on the couch. I sit here, guys talk in the house and I go, hello. And they're talking, freaking out, there's no one there. Next, you know, I hear dishes, stuff moving in the kitchen. And the light starts flickering and I look, I'm like, lots of cats, you know, you're losing your mind. I look over, all three cats were in the tree just looking at me, like walking to our world. I'm like, what? No way. You know, I mean, so like craft of courage. And I go to the kitchen, the light's flickering, so once I get up, the light stays on. There's a dinner table in there with eight chairs. We pushed the chairs in, the chairs had moved away, they were all facing the wall, they're all spread out and everything stopped. I went, oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no. So I backed out of the kitchen and I started praying and I turned off the light and I'm like, you're losing your mind. An hour later, her sister in law got up to go to work at 4:30 and it stopped at 4:15. And I realized what I just witnessed. But I've heard of little kid voices and stuff like that, but just had to share it with you. But thank you and have a good day.
