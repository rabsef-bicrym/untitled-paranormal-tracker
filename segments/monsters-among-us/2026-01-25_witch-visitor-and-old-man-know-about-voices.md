[Speaker G] Yeah, Derek Godinson, Andy from Wyoming. First, I'd like to Say between the podcast and the show, definitely yami hooked, but wanted to call in and tell this little story. Not really sure how to classify it, which possession I know, but used to live in this, this apartment that I had. Had a lot of. Heard a lot of noises, lots of people talking when there was nobody around. Just kind of thought it was a normal thing, I guess. So I used to always have either the tv, music, just anything that made noise on at all times to kind of drown out some of the things that I would hear. So anyways, here, here's where the story ties. Buddy and I went out shooting one day, got back into town, decided we.

[Speaker E] Were gonna.

[Speaker G] Gonna go out and have a few drinks. So before we go out, he gives me a call back and says he's gonna bring this girl with. Brings her by my place and says, hey, I gotta, I gotta go run and do something real quick.

[Speaker E] I'll be right back.

[Speaker G] Okay. So I'm sitting in my place with this, this lady that I've never met before. She begins to tell me she's a witch. All this stuff.

[Speaker E] Yeah, whatever.

[Speaker G] Maybe you are, maybe you're not. Who am I to judge?

[Speaker E] But.

[Speaker G] So she asks me if she can do some sort of, I guess, palm reading. So I give her my hand. She goes ahead, looking at my hand, and all of a sudden she says, there's something going on. There's more going on here.

[Speaker F] It's.

[Speaker G] It's coming from the closet, which in the apartment was the only place that ever gave me the creeps.

[Speaker F] But.

[Speaker G] She tells me that the only reason that I have the TV or music or anything on is to drown out their voices. I didn't really ask who, but I, I kind of knew what she was talking about, but I had never really told anybody that, so for her to know that was a little odd. So she asked me if she can get up and go make a drink. I said, oh, yeah, sure. Kitchen's right over there. You know, this girl goes in there and she's mixing herself up a highball and says, man, I really like these knives. I said, yeah, it's, it's a new.

[Speaker E] Pocket knife I got.

[Speaker G] Well, she then says, no, I mean these. Lets out this blood curdling scream and comes running, charging at me. This knife, like she's gonna stab me. Well, I still had a firearm or two out at that point. So I grabbed one of them, explained to her the severity of the situation and got her out of my place. So fast forward to about, I want to say about two years later. The original incident was 2012, I'd say 2013. So about two years later, a buddy and I go down to Utah, go to a concert, hanging out. We go hit this bar afterwards, there's this little old man there asks me if I've got time to shoot a game of pool with him. So I humor him and I'm shooting a game of pool with him and he asks me if I'll come outside and talk to him while he has a cigarette. Oh yeah, sure. I got none better to do. So I'm outside talking to him and he's saying some off the wall stuff. Nothing, nothing super out there. Until he tries to get me to take some sort of a little rock. I was anti taking anything. I mean, eventually I did take it, tossed it in the bushes. But as I'm getting ready to leave, he puts his hand on my shoulder and he says, I've already spoke with her. And I looked at him because I didn't really know what he was talking about. And he looked at me and he said, no, you don't understand. I've already spoken with her and she knows that you still hear them.
