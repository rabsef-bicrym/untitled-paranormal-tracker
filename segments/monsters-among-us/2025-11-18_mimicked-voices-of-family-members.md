[Speaker C] Hi, Derek.

[Speaker B] My name is Holly.

[Speaker C] I live in a small town outside of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. And a story on season 15, episode 13 jogged my memory and reminded me of something that happened at the beginning of this year. It was one morning after my husband had left for work. I was in the kitchen getting ready for the day, packing my lunch, etc. And I heard what sounded like my husband say, phi, gotta go out. So our dog's name is Phoebe. And whenever my husband would take his.

[Speaker B] Lunchbox out to his truck and start.

[Speaker C] His truck for the day, he would.

[Speaker B] Ask her if she needs to go out.

[Speaker C] And I knew that he had already left for the day, but the dog.

[Speaker B] And I just kind of looked at.

[Speaker C] Each other like, is he still here? Did he come back? I looked around the house and he.

[Speaker B] Had not come back.

[Speaker C] And then maybe a week or so later, I was running errands and my husband was home with our daughter.

[Speaker B] And when I got home, he told.

[Speaker C] Me he was changing her diaper in her room. And it sounded like I had come home.

[Speaker B] And I said hello or something.

[Speaker C] I don't remember exactly what he said. He heard my voice say, but him and my daughter both looked at each other again, just like me and the dog. And she started saying, mama. And when they came out of the room, I wasn't home yet. So we didn't see each other's doppelgangers. We just heard each other's voices. But yeah, so that's a weird similar story that happened to us, and I wanted to send it in. Thanks.
