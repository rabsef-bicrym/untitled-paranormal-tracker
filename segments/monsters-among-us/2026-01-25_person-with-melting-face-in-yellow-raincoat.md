[Speaker B] Hey, Derek, this is Dan, located in northern Lake County, Illinois. Just wanted to give you a story that I had. This was probably maybe around 2005, 2006. So me and a buddy of mine, my best friend at the time, we were hanging out, staying out late. Don't remember exactly what we were doing, but I dropped him off at his house, and then I started heading back to where I lived at at the time. As I was coming down this road, it was pretty late at night. This was maybe like 1:32am and it was storming really bad. It was a bad rainy night. So I was heading down to where I live, and I remember I saw somebody walking on the side of the road. They were wearing a yellow raincoat. And you kind of know how when you pull up on somebody, you can see their face a split second right before you pass them. This is exactly what happened to me, except when this person, when they turned around and looked at me, it looked like their face was literally melting. I'll never forget this. I don't know exactly what it was. I wasn't really tired or anything, so I know I wasn't, you know, my mind wasn't playing tricks on me. But right before I passed them, he or she looked at me, and their face was literally looked like it was melting off or maybe it was someone who was badly deteriorated or something. But I'm not exactly sure what I saw. That's pretty much the only thing that's happened to me. Appreciate your podcast. Thank you. Bye.
