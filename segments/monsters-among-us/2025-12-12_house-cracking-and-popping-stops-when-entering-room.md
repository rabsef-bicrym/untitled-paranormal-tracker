[Speaker B] Hi, I'm calling about strange occurrences in my new house. It's in East Mesa, Arizona. We've lived here about four months. Our first house, and the house seems to crack and pop when you're not in the front room all by itself. There is no plumbing in the area. It seems to happen when my husband is not here. It happens morning, it happens night. If you walk into the room, it stops. You can hear it from the bedroom. The dogs woke me up this morning, barking and growling at nothing again. I just wondered if anybody had had similar like somebody fussing around in their house when they're not in the room or teasing them. I know the house was built in 97 and the people that lived here before. I know her husband passed away. I don't know if in the house or not. I do refer to the popping as Walter playing around, but I don't know what else it could possibly be. It literally stops the minute you walk into the room. So kind of weird, kind of spooky. Definitely gets my heart rate going when the dog starts freaking out. So I thought I would drop it here and see what everybody thought about it. Thank you. Bye.
