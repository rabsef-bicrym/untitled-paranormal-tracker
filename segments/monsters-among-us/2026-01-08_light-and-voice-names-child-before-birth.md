[Speaker C] Hi Derek. I was just listening to an episode, I think it was season 16, and this guy talked about when he had his baby and then there's a big light in the room and it kind of reminded me to want to tell my story. This was before I was born. Like, I want to say a month or two before I was born, my mom told me this story and she had said that she had already had my name. Says she wanted to name me Darlene. Disclosure, I'm not going to give my name, but that's my middle name now. So she said that she had a dream before she had me. And in the dream she said that she had this strong white light come up to her. She couldn't really see it. It was like a shining light. How she described it, like someone's coming close to you, but you're kind of blinded by the light. And she said there was a voice that told her to name me. My first name. I don't want to say, but it told her to name me that and that it slowly faded away and that she ended up waking up and she was just like, wow. And I had asked her, like, oh, well, you know, were you scared? Was this a scary feeling for you? Like, what was it? She had said that it was a very peaceful feeling. She wasn't scared at all. And that that happening made her give me my name now and that she wasn't a Nami Darlene. But then she ended up putting that as my middle name. And yeah, that's kind of my story. I just thought it was so interesting and neat and how that guy, when his daughter came in and there's a strong light. Only when like people are born does that seem to happen. And I believe in angels and demons. And I don't know, I like to think of it as like my guardian angel kind of guiding her. But it's also, I see it as like almost a blessing and I'm kind of like protected and I have a guardian angel over me. That's kind of my story. Catch all later Cape it spooky. Thank you.
