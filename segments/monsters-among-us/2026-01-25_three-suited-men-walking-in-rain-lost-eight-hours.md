[Speaker C] Hi, Derek. My name is Caitlin and I'm from Rock Springs, Wyoming, and where this happened. My story is about the mirrored men. I really didn't know about the mirrored men until I started listening to your podcast. And I've been listening to your podcast for like, a very long time now. And by the way, I love the show. So how it started was when I was about, I want to say, eight or nine years old, me and my family just moved here from Washington, so I love the rain. And so when it finally started to rain around like May Aprilish, my brother had a really good view of this thunderstorm that was going on. And so I was like, can I sit in your room and chill and watch the thunderstorm? And he was like, yeah, but I'm gonna go to bed now, just so you know. And I was like, all right. So I just sat by his window. No chair, nothing. I just stood on my knees and then put my elbow on the window and started looking out the window. And the rain died down a little bit. So then I start seeing these three men walking at the like, same pace with like, synchronized with each other with suits that all looked alike, even their haircuts, even looked alike too. And I was thinking, that's a little bit weird that there's three, like young looking, maybe early 20 year olds walking out in the rain or after the rain died down because there's not really, you know, that much bars around. And I was like, huh, Well, I can't wait to be older and, you know, be 20, 21, walking around whenever I want. And I kept looking at them and I was hoping one of them would, like, I don't know, stop or something because they were like, so synchronized. I was like, that's cool, I guess. And one of them on the very left, the left man turns around just his head a little bit and looks at me. And at this time, it was at like 11pm at night, and he looks at me and all of a sudden I wake up and it's 7am in the morning, the sunrise is coming up, and I'm still looking out the window with my elbows on the window and my palm under the knees of my chin. And I was like, whoa, how did that happen so quickly? Because I'm the one that always loves sleep. Like, I love sleep so much that I would have not just have sat there the whole seven, eight hours that I was looking at there without going to bed, like, because I'm like a light sleeper like that. And so I thought it was, like, really weird because I was like, all right, all right. So I went back to bed, and then I woke up the next morning and I told my mom about it and she just kind of, you know, just like brushed it off, like, oh, okay, you know, whatever. And I was like, that's kind of weird. And so Years later, I'm 21 now, and I was listening to your podcast about the mirrored Men. I was like, oh, my gosh, that is so crazy. I. I guess I had an experience with them. Yes, that's my story. Thank you so much for listening to me. And I love your podcast. And Mirrored Men is my favorite thing now. Thank you. Have a good day. Bye.
