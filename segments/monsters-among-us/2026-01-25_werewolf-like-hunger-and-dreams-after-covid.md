[Speaker C] Hello, Derek, this is Pete. I'm in Wyoming. It's kind of a weird story. I got Covid and some people lost their. Their appetite or sensitivity and smell. For me, it was a little different. I didn't. I kind of have been hungry all the time. I'm over it now, but just been having weird dreams. Almost like I'm turned into a werewolf and almost like the movie American Werewolf in London. And my dream is I come to work and I just get extremely hungry and I kind of turn and pretty much maul everybody at work. I know it's strange. I was told anybody, not even my wife, about it because they'll probably think I'm totally nuts and probably lock me away, throw away the key. Yeah, I know it's kind of sounds bizarre, but I'm just hungry all the time. Even when I eat a big huge meal about 10 minutes later, I'm hungry again. Haven't gained any weight and yeah, I just had the awful nightmares. And it's strange because I. I know I live out here in Wyoming and I noticed coyotes in the area, but yeah, there have been like, dogs come up missing. I know I have nothing to do with it, but yeah, there's like, there's a family down about a mile away. They raise rottweilers and I guess two came up missing. They don't know where they went. But I don't know if that's any connection to it all. But that's just. Just my story, I guess. Love your show and keep it going. All right, bye.
