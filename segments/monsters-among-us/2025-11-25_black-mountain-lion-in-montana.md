[Speaker C] Hi Derek, I am calling to you from a small town in Montana about halfway between Bozeman and Missoula. And I am calling to tell you about something that just happened, but not to me, to my parents who happen to be in town right now visiting. They are staying a few blocks away from me at a campground. And my dad was sitting outside watching the kind of cliffy hillside behind him because there were a bunch of marmots or rock chucks running around on it when he noticed something large and black. And he said at first as he was watching it he thought it was a bear. But as it came down the hillside lower and lower and he got a better look at it, he realized this was clearly a mountain lion, except the problem with it is it was black, and black mountain lions don't exist. So he realized that nobody was going to believe him. So he called my mother outside and she also saw what they are calling a black mountain lion to the point where my mom said, you know, it was a panther. We were looking at a panther. Except panthers don't exist, allegedly in Montana. Now, my husband happens to be in law enforcement, so I gave him a call and let him know what they had just seen because it had disappeared on the site. They're still sitting, hoping they can see it again and get a photo of it. And he said that he knows there's been at least one other report to Fish and Game in the past few years in the area about someone seeing a black panther, but that there was no photographic proof that time. So Fish and Game didn't really believe the report. So, I mean, hopefully my parents can manage to get a photo or see it again during their time here and capture it, because without a photo, I don't think anyone is going to believe them. Now Me being obsessed with your show and all things spooky. And Cryptid was so excited to hear about it and immediately started telling them all about the big cats and everything going on. And they're non believers, so they just kind of laughed me off. But I do think it made them feel better to know that other people have seen big black cats where they're not supposed to be. Okay, I'm gonna get back to listening to your show, which is what I was doing when I got the phone call. I truly love listening to it in reverse and kind of hearing how it has changed over the seasons. Thank you and have a great day.
