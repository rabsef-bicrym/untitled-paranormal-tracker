[Speaker H] Hey, my name is Matt. I'm from Northern Virginia, but my story takes place in Amelia, Virginia. So a little bit southwest of Richmond. It was back in either beginning of 2010 or end of 09. I was living with a friend of mine at the time. We were playing Yu Gi oh in his room because it was, you know, late at night and you know, dumb teenagers. It had snowed like crazy the day before and we're, you know, just like nothing to do outside. It's too bloody cold. So we're playing. I get up to stretch my legs. I open the blinds a bit because almost a full moon out there and with the full moon, almost full moon and with the snow it's made it so it was really easy to see everything that was going around. And near the end of his driveway, just walking. There were three. I don't want to call them people, but just like three moving really, really slowly. I just see that. I'm like, hey, check this out real quick. And he gets up, takes a look at it with me. And we're just watching them move. They're moving so freaking weird slowly. So we're watching them for a little bit, and then like, I don't know, we feel like. I feel like I zoned out while watching them. When I look away, I just look at my button like, hey, you want to keep playing? And he was like, yeah, but what about them? And then we look back out there and there's nothing there. And then he checks his phone and it was like four in the morning at that time, but when we looked, it was like, close to like, 11 something. Only thing I can think of is, well, after listening to a lot of your podcasts and you talking about the Mirrored Men, that's all I can think of is what they were. Yeah. I hope you like my story. Haven't seen anything like them since. Hadn't seen anything like them before. Didn't even know what they were until I heard that podcast. Thanks. I love the show. I've been listening since almost the beginning.
