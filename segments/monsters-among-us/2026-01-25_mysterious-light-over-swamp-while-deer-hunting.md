[Speaker B] Hey Derek, this is Len from upstate New York. I got a little bit of a story to tell you, hopefully before I run out of time. It was probably about 2016 and my father and I were heading out to go deer hunting that morning, probably late October, early November. And we were going to the south end of Canisius Lake, Finger lakes area about 30 miles south of Rochester, New York. And this field that we were hunting. The area that we were hunting, it was public access, New York state land. Parked the car, well, parked my truck on the side of the road, had to walk about 100 yards into this field. We finally got to the hedgerow that separated the field and the woods swamp area. And my father decided in the hedgerow facing out into the field back up towards the road. And I was gonna go about another 30 yards in and sit facing into the swamp. Now, mind you, this is probably about 4:30, 5:00 clock in the morning, where it's so dark right now that when you turn your headlamp off, you can't even see your hand in front of you. I mean, it is dark. So I settle in against a big tree stump and I'm facing into the swamp. And after about 10 minutes of just sitting there and getting settled in, trying not to make any noise, waiting for their sunrise from across the swamp, I see a dim light. Now, if I had to guess, this light was probably about 2 to 300 yards away from me at that first point that I saw it. And I'm thinking to myself, there's absolutely no way somebody's coming across this swamp from that direction at this time of year, considering that it was probably only 40 degrees outside and the water would have been at least waist deep in certain areas of the swamp. So I figured, you know what, I'm gonna sit there and wait and see what happens. You know, maybe this is a hunter that's lost or whatever. So I'm sitting here in this light continues to approach me. This whole situation probably took about a good five to seven minutes, as was getting closer to me, to actually realize that this light that I was looking at was about 15 to 20ft up off the ground. You know how sometimes when you look at certain things at a distance, they appear to be elevated. And as they get closer to you or you get closer to it, it basically comes down to your level of eyesight. Well, this particular light never changed its height. It maintained probably about a 15 to 20 foot elevation the whole entire way. So now I'm really puzzled to figure out what this is. And I'm sitting here still being as quiet as possible, you know, not, not moving at all, no motion, trying to control my breathing because, you know, starting to get a little, little concerned about what this might be. It gets probably within 25 yards of me, still at about 15 to 20ft up off the ground, and it stops. So at that point, I'm sitting there not knowing what this thing is. And I Tell myself, okay, you know what? I'm gonna close my eyes, I'm gonna count the three, and whatever this is is going to disappear because I'm just seeing something. My eyes are playing tricks on me. So I close my eyes, open my eyes back up, and now this light's even closer, and it's still 15 to 20ft up in the sky. So now it's probably 10 to 15 yards away from me. So I'm sitting, sitting there, noticing that there's no sound there. There's no movement at all inside these woods. I'm not moving. I'm not making noises. You know, the birds, the squirrels, chipmunks that are usually making all kinds of noise at that time of morning. There's no sound at all. There's nothing. It's dead silent. Nothing. Now I'm basically just staring at this light, not knowing what it is. I'm just waiting to see what this thing's going to do. And then at that point, it makes a quick move to my left, which would have been to its right, and it just goes. Shoot straight up into the sky and gone. Just gone. No, no noise. No, no. Gone. So I'm sitting there wondering what the hell that was. And I just saw. You know, as I'm sitting there, I notice sounds start to come back into the woods. You know, you start hearing some of the birds chirping that early in the morning. Morning scurrying of. Of the critters, whether the squirrels or, you know, chipmunks, whatever, is roaming around at that time in the morning, waking up. So, yeah, it's. It's definitely something that. I mean, I've told several people this particular story. You know, of course, you get the same ridicule from everybody. Oh, you saw nothing or your eyes are playing tricks on you. You know, whatever the case may be, no one cares to want to use their imagination or think outside the. I even have a couple friends that are some part of some paranormal groups here in the area, and I've told them the story. Even. They. For some reason, I don't. Maybe they can't put the head around the idea, but they just don't seem to. To want to even consider this particular experience even happen. I've listened to several podcasts, your podcast, and a few others. And, you know, after listening to them, you know, you start to understand that sometimes these Lloyds are associated with Bigfoot. Now, I can't say I saw a Bigfoot or a Sasquatch. And truthfully, as much as I'm interested in that Stuff. I'm not sure if I really want to see one or not. You know, I do hunt a lot. I'm outdoors, either hunting or fishing. I do bring my kids out quite often. You know, I'm not quite sure if I'd ever enter the woods again if I ever came across something like that. So, yeah, that's my story. And to this day, I haven't experienced anything else like that, but it's still something that I think about every single time I walk into the woods, especially early in the morning when going hunting. All right, Derek, Well, I hope everything goes well for you and keep up the good work with your podcast and website. Do appreciate it, man. Have a good day. Bye.
