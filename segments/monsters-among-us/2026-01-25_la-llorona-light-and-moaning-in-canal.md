[Speaker C] Hey, Derek, this is Juan. Hello. The podcast. I live in El Paso, Texas, a little city right next to it called Socorro. It was up in late 90s, I want to say, 96, 99. I was still a teen, was out drinking with a couple of friends, and about maybe half a mile from my. From my mom's house, started getting late. I decided to walk back to my mom's house. I was walking, I want to say it was maybe midnight. I was walking. There's actually a canal that runs through our neighborhood and I have to cross that canal, the little makeshift bridge that we had made since we were younger kids. Anyways, I was going, walking back home. I was crossing this little bridge. For some reason, I got the feeling or some weird feeling to look towards my left, straight down the canal, I saw a little sign of light, like maybe a light bulb, like if somebody might have been down there with a flashlight, fishing or something. But at the same time, I also heard like a little yell. Not yell, like a little moan type of feel. And the light started getting bigger and bigger, sort of like a. Like a spotlight type. And the moan and. Or yellow, whatever it was, started getting louder and louder. But this time I hauled to my mom's house, got to my mom's house. My mom was up there, up. I don't know what the hell she was doing. I guess she might have been drinking, getting a glass of water or something. She looks at me, she tells me, what, what's going on? She got scared and I just let her know, you know what? I explained to her what I saw. And she just responded to me, you know, what might have been La Llorona or La Muerte. He said, you shouldn't be out at that night, that time of night doing stuff you're not supposed to be doing.

[Speaker E] And.

[Speaker C] I just went to bed and I just. I mean, I just lay there, eyes wide open and couldn't sleep. I was just scared of. I was just scared. But that's a. That's my story. It's a little. Little quick story. You know, I got. I got a few more little stories that happened to me. Not. Not scary like this one, but all come back another time. See what you think about that. See, we could offer any type of information or you might have heard a story like that. I'm. I'm currently on season three, so let's see if you got this will work for you. Hopefully you could play it. Thank you so much. Love the podcast. Bye bye.
