[Speaker D] Hola Derek hey, this is Bessa and I am from Kansas City.

[Speaker G] Not originally, but this is where the car broke.

[Speaker D] I have a UFO story that I wanted to share with you and your listeners. So this was around 1977. My family at the time was migrant workers, so we lived in South Texas, but we would drive up to Wisconsin and Michigan and Arkansas for seasonal work. And I tell you this to go along with my story. Like I said, summer about 1977 or so, my stepdad had been picked up for a dui, so my mom and his brother had to drive up to pick him up from jail. At the time I was about 4, maybe 5 years old and so I was sitting in the backseat, it was dark outside, it was summer. I believe we were in Wisconsin or Michigan, one of those two, and I could hear my mom and his brother chatting about whatever was going on with the incident that had occurred. Then all of a sudden, my mom's tone, her voice changed and I could tell that she was concerned. And she said to the driver, his name was Roy. She said, do you see that? What is that? What do you think that is? And so that alerted me. And like I said, I was sitting in the backseat. So I slowly crept up from the backseat to see what they were talking about. And that's when I saw it. To the right side, behind my mom, there appeared an object, a disc shape object. And it was hovering above, I want to say either corn or something very tall. And it was just hovering. I remember didn't have any noise, it didn't have anything but different colors, like brilliant colors, red and orange. And anyways, I remember my mom saying to Roy that that was a ufo. And then that's all I can recall. So fast forward. In 2019, I drove down to Arkansas to bring my mom up to Kansas City to see our new home. Go, chief. On the way. Coming up, she and I were listening to a creepy podcast and I brought up this incident and I said to her, hey, Mommy, do you remember? And then she said just the same story that I'm relaying to you, that she saw the ufo, but she doesn't remember, like, what happened afterwards. She just knows that picked up my stepdad and went about her business, but she doesn't recall, like, how long it took when it was anything like that. So anyways, I wanted to share this little story. Thank you for the podcast and thank you for giving us a venue to share our stories. Take care and be well. Adios.
