[Speaker C] Hi Derek. My name is Lumen. I am from the state of Oregon. So this story took place something so years ago, little background. I am fifth generation farmer on the same property that my mother is farming on, my grandfather farmed on, his father farmed on, and so forth. This is in rural Oregon, closer to the town of Woodburn. This is probably the third house that I've lived in in this property. And it was the time where my grandfather had passed over the farm to my mother. So my family had moved into the main farmhouse. And the main farmhouse has had several stories of just ghostly activity, voices, weird encounters. It goes on and on and on and on. But this one took place when I was probably 13, and it was one of the ones that stuck in my mind so much that I can remember the exact time that it occurred. So one night I'm sitting in my bed, I'm reading a book with my light on. It is 1:45 in the morning, very late. Everyone is asleep. I have my window slightly cracked open, curtains drawn, because I do not like looking out at night. Something about it just gives me the heebie jeebies. I've never liked the farm at night. And I remember sitting there reading, and I just hear a cat coming from the window on my bedside. And I hear like a little kid's voice, kind of echoey going, can I come in? Hello, Can I come in, please? Hello? And I just stared dead at that window. Did not acknowledge it, did not say anything back. Reached over, turned my lamp off and laid down. And I knew it wasn't probably like a video or any audio that could have been made. I wasn't allowed any technology until I was like closer to high school. So I didn't have a phone, I didn't have a laptop. I had nothing that could have played this audio. I knew for a fact it was not my sisters playing a prank at me, because my little sisters, one was probably like 12, one was probably 8, and the other was infant. And so they weren't gonna be on the second floor roof at 1:45 at night. And I knew it wasn't someone playing around on the property, crawling onto the roof and trying to stare me. Because we live down a half a mile long driveway. Our house is hidden by trees. We are surrounded by the forest, another farm field. No one actually knows our house is there. Like, even when we give them direction, they get very lost and very confused and they end up in our lower field somehow. But it absolutely horrified me. It's not like the first time I've had an encounter in that room. It is one of the original foundations of the bedroom. My grandmother had remodeled that house like twice or so. And then I know my great grandmother had remodeled that house once before. But out of the four upstairs bedrooms, these two bedrooms were the only two that had not been touched. And mine was one of them. I've had way too many encounters in that room for me to just chalk it up to nothing, but I had gotten so used to just ignoring it and pretending like it wasn't there because of how many times it happened. Like my mother's had encounters when she slept in that room when she was a kid. My uncles have had the most. They both would swap this bedroom growing up because they both couldn't handle what they were experiencing. But that was one of the most scariest ones. Like, I'd never heard voices before until that very night. And it made me feel like I was crazy because no one believed me when I would tell them. But thank you. Your podcast is great. Have a good one. Bye.
