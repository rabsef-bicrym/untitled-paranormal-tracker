[Speaker A] Hi, this is Holly. I'm sharing an experience I had in Florida in a small house. My landlord owned it years ago, and he ended up selling it, and he found it again years later, and it was on a different street from what he told me was there was a Native American medicine man, somebody said, that had bought the property, the land, and didn't want the house. So he had the house to move to another street. So that's when I moved in. And it was beautiful. It was all natural wood. It was like a mile from the beach. It was a really nice location. And I thought it was kind of weird because there were about seven doors that led to the outside. So no matter where you were in the house, you could basically go outside, which was great, but kind of weird, I guess. So I lived there for about two years, but about a year in, there were some weird things that started happening. It started with one afternoon, and I was just sitting on the couch with closing my eyes, and I had this intrusive thought. It was like this vision, like it was this space, and it was super weird and kind of creepy. It took me by surprise. I jumped up and I walked to the bathroom around the corner. We had a big window in the bathroom, so I looked out the window, and there was a possum sitting there staring back at me. And it was the same face that I saw when I was sitting there. So it was just this weird moment, and I'm like, hi. The opossum just looked back at me like, hi. So that was weird. Then there started being some weird things happening. Like, at night, I would be sitting there, and it was like somebody was pulling my hair, like, yanking my hair. And that happened, like, two or three times. And I did hear footsteps. And there was another time I would have a candle lit in a room without any air blowing or anything. The fan wasn't on, and I would leave the room, come right back, and the candle would be blown out. That was a little weird, too. So I'm starting to get a little on edge. And basically the last thing that was the end for me was it was afternoon again. I was walking through my house and started to approach the kitchen, and there was another room off to the right. And as I'm approaching the kitchen and that room, I see three men. I guess I just assumed they were men. And they were right, maybe three feet from me, like, right there. And they were all facing each other with, like, their heads down and they had hoods on. And I basically just froze. It was really, really silent, really eerily silent. And you would have thought that they were talking or something. You would hear something because they're all facing each other. But there was no noise or anything, and I just froze, and I backed up, and I just. I don't remember anything else. I've tried to figure out what I did after that because usually that would be kind of memorable. Like, you know, what do I do in this situation? There's three people in my house, but I don't remember anything. So, Yeah, so that basically, after that incident, I felt really uncomfortable in that house. I always felt like I wasn't alone. I always felt like there was something there, and I couldn't sleep well. I ended up moving probably, like, two months after that. I never went back.
