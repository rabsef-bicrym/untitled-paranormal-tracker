[Speaker C] Hi Derek, this is Dana from Alabama. Even though I live in Alabama, this will be a story from when I lived in England. So it's been over 10 years now. I lived in England for three years to get my bachelor's degree. And while I lived there, I was on a student visa. So under a student visa, at least back then, you could work 20 hours per week while you were in school and you could work 40 hours while you were on breaks, like Christmas break, et cetera. And I had a job at a place called Office and it's a shoe store. And it was in York. I lived in York at the time. And it was the main floor three stories above it, and then a cellar basically below it with a door that I don't know how it was up to code. I mean, it was probably three feet tall to get into the cellar. And you know, it connected to the old, like aqueducts, that bar under York. I mean, York has so much history. It goes back to Romans and Vikings and all of this kind of stuff. So it's built on a ton of history. And I can remember no one ever wanted to go down to that cellar ever. But we kept like our wellies down there, like our rain boots, basically, things that were waterproof because it did get damp. It was not inflated. It was just a cellar in the streets of York. So I would always go down there just because I kind of liked being creeped out. And I never experienced anything down there. But I will say my one experience that I had in that store was on the second floor. Whenever we would go up to get shoes, we were constantly running up and down those stairs and on the second floor landing There was a comfy chair there, just one on the landing where people could sit and eat their lunch if they wanted to. And I was running up and my friend Claire was sitting on that chair. She had just taken a bite of her sandwich, which is very important. Her mouth was full. I could see that her mouth was full. And as I turn right to go into what we called the Converse Room, I went past the wall into the stockroom. And once I'm fully away from Claire, I hear her say something. I can't tell you what it was. I immediately just thought, oh, she said something. There's a wall between us now. So I just didn't hear her. I go in, I find the shoes that I need, I come back out and I'm like, hey, girl, what'd you say? Did you say something to me? And she was like, no, I was gonna ask you the same thing. Thing. And as she's saying this, she's like, her hand is over her mouth, she's still chewing and like she's eating. She could not have spoken as clearly as what I heard. Whatever it was speak. I can't tell you to this day what it said. I mean, it was so clear that it was just right in my ear, right like they were standing behind me. And she had the same experience. She thought it was just as close to her. We both thought each other had spoken. And, you know, that whole place was creepy. Even the very top floor, everyone would get like this feeling of vertigo. No one wanted to go up there alone. My shoes got thrown across the stock room once. I'm still not convinced whether or not that was a ghost or if it was someone playing a prank on me. Everyone says they did not play a prank on me, so they swear hand down. You know, I trust them to a certain extent, but, you know, all my friends that worked there had similar, just little one off experiences like that. But anyway, I just wanted to call in, keep it spooky. Thanks for all that. You do love the podcast.
