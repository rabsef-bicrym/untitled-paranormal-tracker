[Speaker D] Hello, this is Elizabeth. Back in 1998, I was like 18 years old at the time. My parents live in Tennessee. Once I turned 18, I would go visit back and forth my friends in California and everything. I was young at that time. I was staying in California for a few months. I was living in a rented house with my ex boyfriend at the time. And you know, a few of our friends right before I flew over there, they had just moved into that house not that long ago. And I wasn't really on the lease.

[Speaker G] But you know, that goes.

[Speaker D] But I remember my ex boyfriend at the time, he was saying how he was in the bathroom, he just got a shower, he saw the handle of the door turn. He thought it was one of his daughters because he had two little girls. And he was like, stop it, stop it you guys. And he opened it up, and no one was there. And he was like, oh, wait, they're at school. So he had told me that before. Well, I didn't see anything in the house, but one afternoon, I was alone in the house. Everybody else was at work. One of my childhood friends, she lived like, five houses down, so we would hang out all the time because I grew up in that area. Anyway, so one afternoon, she walks over to the house because she's only a few houses away, and she goes, hey, do you want to come over? I'm going to go get something at my house. And I was like, sure. And I said, well, wait, I don't have a key, because remember, my name's not on the lease. And I don't really have a key to the house because whenever I would come home, it would just randomly be when I knew when people would be there. When my boyfriend was off of work or something. She goes, why don't you just leave the door unlocked? We're only going to be there for, like, two minutes. So we literally went over there for two, maybe three minutes. Top I left the door unlocked because no one else was in the house. We walked over to her house to get something real quick. Two, three minutes. Walking back is like a minute, maybe two minutes. We come back and the door is locked. And we specifically left it unlocked. We were both like, what the. No one else was home because I rang the doorbell. I'm like, well, maybe Billy came home, or maybe Suzette came home and nobody was there. We actually ended up going through a window that was unlocked. So we kind of crawled back in the window. That was weird. And it wasn't a big deal at the time, but that was kind of weird to us because we were just shaking after that. But that was just something small. Thank you for using it.

[Speaker G] Talk to you soon.

[Speaker D] Bye.
