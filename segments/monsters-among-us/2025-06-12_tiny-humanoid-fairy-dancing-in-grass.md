[Speaker A] My name's Jay. So when I was about 8, I was walking around my neighborhood in spring or summer. This was about 12 or 13 years ago. It was warm and the sun was just starting to set. I live in the suburbs of Southern California, but we have a lot of, like, open space and trees around where I live, at least at the time that this happened. Unfortunately, a lot of it has since been destroyed. So there's one big stretch of city property, I guess along sort of a back row of houses near us. And it was covered in a bunch of, like, the tall native grass from the open space sort of grasslands. And it was shaded by this huge, beautiful oak tree, which I loved as a kid. So as I walked past, I was watching all these little insects darting around in the grass, sort of glowing with, like, the sunset. It was really beautiful. And my eyes fell to, like, one figure in particular. It was larger than the small flies, but not by a ton. It was only maybe an inch or two in height, and it was clearly humanoid, but it looked very thin and spindly, sort of like it was made of twigs. I remember seeing very humanoid legs in particular. And I don't remember what the face looked like or if I even could make out details of it at the time, but I think it had wings. It was bouncing between a few blades of grass. And I somehow felt like it was dancing for me or that it was letting me see. Like, I could tell that this thing was aware of me and it was sort of giving me permission to see. Looked a lot like. There's this video that is very clearly fake. But I thought after this experience and was shocked by how similar it looked. It's called on YouTube, like, Creepy Fairy UK or something. It's a figure very much like what I described, which, again, I saw this video after this experience and it freaks me out because of how similar. Anyways, so I crouched down and I was watching this thing for a few minutes, and it very weirdly didn't feel shocking to me. It was exciting, but I wasn't freaking out. It felt very natural, like if I was looking at a squirrel or a bird. And this is coming from someone who loves fairies, like any kid, especially kids raised as girls, we love fairies. And I was very creative and I had a great imagination, but that's never bled into what I knew to be real. I could always tell the difference between that and I never had any other experience like this. Until a few years ago, it was very strange to me and I've heard a few times from other people with strange experiences. That feeling of it doesn't feel shocking or scary like it should, even though it's very clearly out of the ordinary. Anyway, that stretch of grass has unfortunately since been converted into turf, and a lot of the trees in our neighborhood are cut down. But sometimes I still, when I'm walking through, have that same feeling when I saw it. I don't really know how to describe what that is exactly, but I'm very grateful to have had that experience. It pushed me into further obsession with the fae and eventually into paganism. I don't know, just curious if anyone had any similar experiences. Anyway, have a great day.
