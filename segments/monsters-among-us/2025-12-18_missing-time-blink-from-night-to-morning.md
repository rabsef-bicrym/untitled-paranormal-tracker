[Speaker B] So I'm gonna start with my first story.

[Speaker A] Just kind of comes off the heels of season 11, episode 19 with missing time. The caller had a experience that I actually had as well when I was younger.

[Speaker B] Didn't happen here in Texas, actually happened at my grandparents home in Massachusetts.

[Speaker A] I was about 6, 7 years old right before my family moved to Colorado.

[Speaker B] Which is why I was actually at.

[Speaker A] My grandparents house cause they were watching us while my parents were looking for a home.

[Speaker B] What happened was, is I went to bed one night.

[Speaker A] I knew it was dark.

[Speaker B] At one point I was awake just.

[Speaker A] Staring at the ceiling and it was like I blinked and it was morning. Like we're talking not like sun rising, but bright like sun coming through the window. And all that thermosting in was upstairs.

[Speaker B] Kind of on their second floor, almost a converted attic space. There was one window and I know.

[Speaker A] The first question you're going to ask is was there three identical men? And I can tell you, I don't know. I didn't get up to see because it was kind of one of those weird experiences, but wanted to share that.

[Speaker B] With you because apparently I'm not the only one that experienced that.

[Speaker A] And I appreciate the other caller calling.

[Speaker B] In because it jogged my memory.

[Speaker A] Love the show and keep it up.

[Speaker B] Thanks Dirk.
