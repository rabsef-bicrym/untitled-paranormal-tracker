[Speaker A] Hi, Derek. This is Beatrix from Virginia. But this story is originally coming from my childhood bedroom in Long Island. I just listened to your Christmas podcast and someone told a story about a Furby. I wanted to call and tell you my Furby story. So when I was in middle school, Furbies were really popular. I think Furbies were probably at their peak maybe in the early 2000s. So that would put me somewhere like around sixth grade, let's say. And I really wanted a Furby. Everybody wanted a Furby. I used to call the radio station C100 to try to be the 100th caller to win a Furby. And, you know, I was one of those kids that forever said my Furby was on its way until I actually got it. So I tell you all this to let you know I was really, really excited when I got my Furby finally. And my Furby was a black and white Furby. And I told this Furby a joke. I said, what's black and white and really stupid? And the Furby's eyes got really low and so did its ears. And I felt like in this moment it was looking right at me. And it said people like that. It said, people, I very clearly remember this. And the reason I don't think my child's mind made this up was I, like, never played with that Furby again. I threw the Furby across the room and this toy that I'd wanted so long, like, really impacted me in a real way. And so when I heard the last story about a Furby, I thought to myself, wow, this is way too many coincidence around these Furbies. The Furby also did used to, like, kind of turn itself on and, like, make noises and. Yeah, I don't know, maybe it was a programming glitch or, I don't know, maybe it's the wavelength that could be tapped into by multi dimensional beings. Furby Explorer Channel. I don't know. I love your show. Thanks so much.
