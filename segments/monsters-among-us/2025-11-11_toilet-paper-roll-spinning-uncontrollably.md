[Speaker D] Hey, what's up, Derek? This is Adam from North Carolina. So this happened to me, I was five years old. I mean, I still remember it, you know, clear as day. So I had one of those Ghostbusters toy sets, you know, had the backpack and the gun and the ghost trapper. I remember I used to go from room to room in my parents house, you know, pretending to shoot ghosts with a gun and trap them. I remember one day I went into a spare bathroom downstairs. My dad built this house, you know, nobody else had ever lived in it before. And I remember I walked into the bathroom, you know, I kind of creeped in real slow, you know, because I'm obviously trying to, you know, catch ghosts. And I turned the corner to where the toilet was and the toilet paper roll started spinning uncontrollably. I experienced it with two senses. I saw it and I heard it, you know, I heard the cardboard toilet paper roll, you know, spinning very, very fast. And I saw the toilet paper, you know, piling up on the ground. And so when I saw this, you know, it immediately freaked me out. I ran out of the bathroom and went to my mom and I told her what happened. At the time she was just like, oh yeah, you know, it's probably just the wind. You know, as a five year old kid, you know, your mom, she just gave you the anteater. Oh, it's the wind. Okay, got it. Cool. So I remember going back into the bathroom and then the toilet paper was back on the roll. I mean, it was like nothing had happened. And so I didn't think about it until years later. I mean, the incident just popped up in my mind and I was like, wait a minute, I was inside. There wasn't any wind inside, especially not the bathroom. So I mean, that's really the only paranormal experience that I've ever had. I'm 36 now. I can't shake it. It's always kind of in the back of my mind and, you know, it pops up from time to time, you know, just kind of wondering what that could have been if not paranormal. I do have, I guess you call it a theory. I think that most if not everybody has an experience to kind of open them up to something paranormal. I believe that it's relatively early on and then the way that we react to that first experience either kind of opens the door for us for the rest of our lives, or if we reject it, then it kind of closes the door a little bit as far as experiencing anything else. Anyways, I'm a big fan of the podcast. Thanks, Derek. Alright, bye.
