[Speaker D] Hello, my name is April. I'm from Southern California. I love the podcast. So my story is this. I was riding a bus one day and there was this guy in front of me. He asked me for a pen and I had a pen on me. I don't know why. And so I give him the pen and he starts writing a piece of paper. He turns around and he starts explaining to me what all these symbols mean on a piece of paper. And I'm like looking at him and I'm kind of figuring out what's going on. He's saying, oh, this is infinity. This is nothing. And they're like all over the piece of paper. One that has like a circle and a line through it. One has like little holes punched through the paper and they're all randomly all throughout the paper. Oh, and the guy just looked really normal. He seemed a little skittish. He looked kind of frightened, but you know he was really clean. He was kind of young, like in his 20s. And he's dressed pretty normal, but just, like I said, kind of skittish. So I asked him, I'm like, what shows you this? Then he told me a thing, showed him this. So I was like, okay. And I'm like, was this thing good? Then he kind of shakes his head kind of weird, the way he shook his head kind of, like, really fast. I don't know, just kind of like jerky. And so we had been stopped at a stop for a while, and he hadn't gone off yet, and all of a sudden, out of nowhere, he just gets off. And I kind of wonder if he left this thing with me or left something with me, if that's why he got off so quickly, because it just seemed really odd that he get off that fast. And so I asked my friend, this guy I know who's really into, like, subtle energies and really clairvoyant and knows about this kind of stuff. I start telling about this, and before I even finish explaining what happened, he says, oh, he started saying this means this. This means this. And I'm like, yes. And so he does this thing where he kind of goes into his zone, and I close my eyes and he kind of sees what's going on, and he tells me that I was exposed to dark forces. He got rid of it, whatever it was, but I just thought it was kind of crazy. I remember kind of like feeling a little bit more irritable than normal after this happened. And then, you know. So, yeah, that's my story. Okay, thank you.
