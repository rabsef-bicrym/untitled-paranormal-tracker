[Speaker C] Hi, Derek. My name's Anthony. I'm from Ohio. And this story takes place in Coshocton County, Ohio, close to New Bedford, actually. My family owns property down there. I'm 43. My whole life, I've been going down there till about 2011. Little disagreement happened and I haven't been there since, except for a couple times. But that's where I used to deer hunt. Spent a lot of times in the woods as a kid. My Friend, me and him from high school. We still hunt together. And it's a December night. If anyone hunts, knows gun season after Thanksgiving. And this particular winter, maybe.09 or 10. I don't really remember the way the family's property is set up on some acreage. There was a house and barn built in the late 1800s, and they were owned by Amish. And then my grandfather bought it in 1962, I believe. And then there was a new addition put on in 81. And as it was, me and my friend were sitting in the basement. Simple ceramic stone foundation basement. We had free gas, so the gas was always on. It was always warm in there. You know, it was a lower level. You could walk right in downstairs. And as it got darker there, no water, no electricity, it would just get dark. And it was snowing very hard. And you know, me and him were always big on going out to deer hunt and no issues there. And we decided that day we weren't going to do it. We were going to have our beers downstairs before we went to get something to eat. We were just downstairs and I remember thinking in my head, I'm hearing this music coming from upstairs. It's like the 1920s music. I don't know how to describe it, just that. Not really a twang, just that 1920s kind of music. And I'm hearing this upstairs, and I don't say anything to him. I just think it's our radio upstairs. We always had a radio that would run off batteries and we would turn it on. You get some of the local stations, and we go to leave and, you know, it's pitch black. We got our flashlights as we're going upstairs. I said, dude, you leave the radio on? And he says, no, I didn't leave the radio on. I said, you didn't leave the radio on? He's like, no. I was like, I've been hearing this music, this old music, like as long as we've been down here just hanging out. And he's like, I didn't leave the radio on. And we both go upstairs and I walk right over to the radio, and the radio is completely off. And I look at him. I was like, I was really hearing some strange music, like old music. And he looks at me, goes, I heard the same thing. But neither one of us had said anything about it, like, to each other until that moment. And it was just very strange. And I've always remembered that to this day, we still talk about how we heard that music and we never knew what it was. And we just simply walked out the door, went to the bar and didn't say nothing else about it and then came back, went to bed and went deer hunting in the morning. Thanks Derek. Great show. Appreciate it.
