[Speaker B] Hey, Derek, my name is Rod. I'm from North Carolina. Let's start off mostly the beginning of the year. I work a night job, 12 hour shifts. We're allowed to go outside and walk the premises if we get too tired. You know, try to stay awake. So in summertime, I like to go out, walk around the building, do a couple laps, you know, a couple rounds just to stay awake. There was a time where I got into mobile gaming. Call of Duty I wasn't able to pick up servers inside the building, so I go outside. This is about between 2:45 and 4:00 clock in the morning. I'm sitting beside my car, play my game. So beside the park lot of my job, there's a church and they have a cemetery. So as I'm sitting by my car playing this mobile game, all of a sudden, up to my left, I hear a hello. Now to me, a hello is words that some older generation will use. So when I heard this hello, I looked over to my left. I didn't see nothing. Now, across from the cemetery, there's a couple houses. And I've been out there sometimes and all I see is the lights on. Never have seen anybody out there that late. So when I hear this hello, I get this, I don't know, odd feeling. It just shivers down my spine. Just talking about it now just brings shivers right back. Just the way I heard this hello was like somebody was forcing to say this hello. It's just freaking creepy, man. After I heard that hello, I looked down at my mobile game for a split second and I walked my butt right back inside the building. I didn't run, I walked. I thought if I run, this thing is going to come after me. Thank you. Hope to hear my story. Hope you can use it. Have a good night.
