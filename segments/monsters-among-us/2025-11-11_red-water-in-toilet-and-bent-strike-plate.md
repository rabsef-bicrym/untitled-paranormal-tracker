[Speaker D] Hey there, my name is James. I'm calling from Lynchburg, Virginia. But my story takes place in Glendale, Arizona back in 2006, where I was living at the time. I was renting my dad's old house from him, where he had lived at for most of my entire youth. I only rented the house from him for about six months, but for the first three months I had a friend living there with me and sharing the rent. I never really had any experiences for those first three months, except for one night when I was home by myself. I was sitting on the couch in the living room watching tv, when all of a sudden I heard what sounded like three distinct footsteps that led from the wall where the TV was out to about where the ceiling fan was, almost directly above me. I found it a bit creepy, but I quickly shrugged it off. Well, a few nights later, when my roommate and I were both home together at the same time, we were both sitting in the living room watching tv, and I made mention to him about the sound like footsteps that I had heard. Well, not long after, almost as if on cue, the exact same footsteps sound happened again, exactly as the last time. I looked up at the fan, and then I looked at him. I said to him, you heard that, right? He looked eerily up at the ceiling fan, and he said he did. Well, that was the only experience that I had in that house during those first three months while my friend was living there with me. But the following three months while I was living there by myself, the activity definitely increased multiple times. I would find the light on in the back bathroom that was connected to the master bedroom when I was sure that I turned it off. You know those cloth that you drop into the tank on the toilet and it turns to water blue? Well, I used those in my toilets. And one day when I came home from work, I went to use the bathroom in the hallway, only to find the water in the toilet was completely turned red. Not purple like as if red had been mixed with blue, a solid red, as if the blue had never been in the toilet to begin with. I was dumbfounded. I had no idea what could have caused this. I was even more perplexed when I flushed the toilet and the dark blue water came back into the bowl and the red water flushed down. Then the next day I came home from work only to find the water in the toilet bowl had turned red yet again. Well, just like the last time when I flushed the toilet, the blue water came back into the bowl and the red water flushed. That only happened twice with the toilet two days in a row. I still to this day have no explanation for that one. What caused it. Then another time, I came home from work, and at the end of the hallway on the left, I found my bedroom door open, ajar. This was significant not only because I lived alone, but also because I also kept all of the bedroom doors down the hallway closed whenever I wasn't home. I cautiously made my way down the hallway and took a peek into my bedroom. It was dark, but nothing looked out of place. I opened the door and turned on the light. Everything looked normal. Then I turned out the light and went to close the door. The door wouldn't close. It hit something hard and made a loud bang sound. I looked down at the floor. Nothing was blocking it. So I tried again. Bang. I looked behind the door. Nothing was there. Then I noticed it. The strike plate on the door frame had been physically bent backwards. So somehow during the day while I was gone at work, my bedroom door opened all by itself and the strike plate had been bent back all by itself. Well, those were the only instances I had while living in my dad's old house. I was visiting my dad at his current house one day where he lived at the time. We were sitting out on the back patio and I asked him. I said, dad, in all your years living in your old house, did you ever experience anything you would consider to be weird or something you couldn't explain? He shot back right away over the stern. That house is not haunted. He clearly didn't want to discuss it and I didn't press the matter. Anyways, that's my story. Thanks for the podcast Derek. I really enjoy listening to it. Keep up the good work. Goodbye.
