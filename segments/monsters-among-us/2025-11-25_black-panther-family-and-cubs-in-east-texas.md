[Speaker B] Hey, Derek, because of your show, I recently discovered that black panthers are cryptids. Didn't know this, and here's the reason why. From 1994 to 2008, my parents and I lived on 10 acres in East Texas. And you know, it's very wilderness area. And we lived on a particular hunting land because my dad and I were avid hunters and we encountered a Black panther family. Essentially, go freak with me. That somewhere packed away is actually a picture of me with a panther's cub. And I remember trying to debunk what I saw the very first time I encountered it because my high school, their mascot was Black Panther. So I figured, you know, oh, it's just one of the teenagers, Joseph and mascot outfit playing a prank on us. But like I said, we're avid hunters. And my dad and I wound up shooting a deer across the creek bed from where we were at. We climbed down in there. It was like about, I want to say, since the sun was going down, it was probably around 8:30 at night at that time. And we climbed down the creek bed, start climbing up the other side. And my dad told me non verbally to stop where I was at because there was something moving. And we heard this really low grumble, kind of like a growl, but like a predatory stalking sound. And as we peek over the top of the ridge, all we see is this huge pure black cat. It's stalking our kills. And that's, you know, my very first encounter. And I'm like, okay, well, you know, that's just not a thing. There's no way that any cat gets vaccinated. But when my dad caught his rifle, it turned to him and just clear as day, you could see the whiskers and like the reflective iris of this cat was kind of like a glowing greenish yellow and it had lids for pupils. So obviously an animal, obviously cat in nature. And you know, we're just staring this thing down and it's staring us down. We're just trying to figure it all out. So my dad, you know, tells me to go back to the other side of the creek bed. We go back up to the truck and we start discussing this cat. And a couple of our neighbors said, you know, maybe it was a Bob's cat. Well, I know what a bobcat looks like. We killed one trying to protect ourselves in the hills of Arizona. So a couple years later, we're hunting again. And I'm laying in a brush trying to create kind of a homemade ghillie suit. And my dad is sitting in a tree stand and he like, nature calls to me and tells me, don't move. And I'm like, okay, why? You know, and I slowly roll over directly above me Laying on a branch is the same panther. And it, like, looked down at me and I could see his, I want to say fangs, but that seems kind of weird. They were large cat teeth with very, very pronounced fangs in the fry. And it just kind of gave off like a cat hisses at you when it letting you know that, hey, you're messing up. And then kind of like arched up a little bit and my dad fired a warning shot. My dad shot the branch underneath this thing and it jumped and just clean out of sight in no time, flash. Like, I didn't even have a chance to react to it. So going on to why I just thought this was a normal critter is because the following three summers in a row, we had come across kind of like a. A nesting area, so to speak. It was laid flat. We thought it was like a deer nesting until we came up, you know, preparing for the hunting season and heard the low grumble of like, the predatory, hey, you're getting too close. Hound again. And we paused, and staring at us from the edge of this nesting area was those bright, yellowish green eyes glaring at us. So my dad and I had this plan to kind of like a peace offering with this large cat. We went and got very thick cut steaks from our local butcher and we brought it out to the nesting area. You know, like I said, three summers in a row we did this, just kind of a peace offering to say, hey, we're gonna go hunting, but here's our peace offering. We won't mess with you if you don't mess with us. And took these stakes out, like, tossed it into the nesting area. And about August that year, this would have been 2007. I want to say it was weird. We threw out the stakes and three cubs, like the biggest kittens I've ever seen in my life, just come trotting out towards us and start gnawing on these raw steaks that we had just thrown out. And the essentially, I'm assuming, mother just comes out and kind of like stays back, but lets them eat while we stay on the other side of this nesting area. And I was always taught when it comes to unknown animals that, like, you're supposed to present yourself without harm, without attempt to harm. So I place my hand flat on the ground and I got down on my knees in front of them and like, laid out my hands for them to sniff, I guess. And one of the cubs come over and sniffs me, licks his paw, and then, like, licks my hand and I got to pet it and My dad, you know, early 2000s era, uses a wind up camera and snaps a picture of me and mama panther over there. Was not happening. Instantly like roared at us and pretty sure I peed myself. But we instantly backed away off another steak that we had and the following year or so later we moved to a larger property on the other side of the town and I hadn't seen it again but our neighbor called us and was like, hey man, what's up with that huge ass cat? So yeah, that's why I thought cancers were just normal. Thanks man, I appreciate the podcast and I hope things continue really well for you. Bye.
