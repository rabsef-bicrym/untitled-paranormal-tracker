[Speaker C] Hi, my name is Allie. I live in Michigan. I wanted to call in a story. It seems kind of weird. I don't know if it goes with the show, but the more I think about it, the more paranormal it seems to me. You'll see once I explain it, but this happened about 15 years ago, I was just a kid. We moved to my house that we live in now. I have a room on the second story of the house with a roof that sort of like comes out right under my window. And this story is actually the reason why I always sleep with my blinds closed at night is because one night when I was younger, I woke up in the middle of the night and looked out the window. And it sounds so silly, but there was three mummies sitting outside my window on the roof. They all were gray, sort of like just super skinny, sitting sort of with their knees up and kind of looking at each other, very bony looking. And you could tell they were wrapped. My memory, they were wrapped in something, but I just remember them being mainly gray. They weren't very big either. It was almost like they were sort of child size. I say I never thought about it again after I told my mom in the morning that's what I saw because I just remember being so afraid and going back to sleep. And I think I eventually got the courage to shut the blinds or something. I don't remember really what happened after that, but I was always told that it was a dream and not to think about it. But I guess what creeps me out about it is that I remember being awake and being able to move because I was scared and I wanted to scoot out of their sight because it was mummies by my window. Yeah, it's not. It sounds silly, but I just thought I'd call it in. Personally, I'm a Christian. I believe in angels and devils and I. I believe that sometimes the devil can and knows what will scare you and can portray itself in that way. So I don't know, maybe it was something like that, or maybe I really was dreaming. But anyways, I love the podcast. Thank you for everything you do, and I thought I'd share that story. Let me know what you think.
