[Speaker C] Hey, this is Dalton from South Carolina and I just want to share, I guess a UFO sighting. Me and my cousin, he's a park ranger at Lake Warren State park and it was a summer night, so it was probably 70 something. Maybe a little hotter than that. Anyways, at the park there's a dock that leads to the lake and it goes out pretty far in the lake. Like, 10, 15ft out. And usually we go out there and we kind of just talk and stargaze and just talk about life, really. And we were out there one night, and we were just doing our normal thing, talking, sharing stories. And the middle of the lake, I saw this light, like, underwater. And I told my cousin, I was like, hey, do you see that light there? He's like, yeah, but it's probably just the road, because there's, like, a dam, if you will, to the right side of us, and cars pass all the time, back and forth. And he was like, yeah, it's just a reflection of somebody passing. And I was like, dude, there's no cars because you could hear the car over the lake because the lake echoes. And he was like, you know what? You're right. So we're looking. All of a sudden, the light just starts moving back and forth, almost like a pinball machine. Like, it's going back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. So I'm like, well, water reflects light. So I look up, and there it was. It was this huge white light. I thought it was the moon the whole time. It was that bright. And I'm looking, and I'm like, what in the world? I kind of hit my cousin on the arm to look up, and as soon as he looks up, it drops down a little bit closer to us, and then it just gone. And it had this weirdest sound. I can't replicate it, but on the water, you could see the ripples of, I guess, like, air kind of hit the water. And you know how, like, a speedboat is on the water. It kind of moves the water. It was almost like that. So then I pull my flashlight out, and I'm looking around the water. And the most scariest thing that night was all the alligators looking at us. And just right there at the dock. That was more scary than what I was looking at. Yeah, that was just the craziest thing. I remember after it left, it was like all the sound came back. The owls, the crickets. I didn't realize at the time, like, it was just silent. But when it left, everything was just boastful loud. It was just like. It came back. It was like, the weirdest thing. But, yeah, the podcast is awesome. Thank you for what you do, and have a good day.
