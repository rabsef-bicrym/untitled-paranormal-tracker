[Speaker B] Hey Derek, My name's John and I'm one of those repeat offenders. This story deals with some mirrored Men and reflects back to the special you had several seasons ago. Based on the Mirrored Men. My event takes place just outside of Troutman, North Carolina on Interstate 77. And to preface this, I want to say that the one lady that I heard on this Mirrored Men special, we have something in common. So I want her to know that she's not crazy. But here is the story. Back in 2000, this event occurred that I had chalked up to just being phenomenally tired due to the fact that I was working long hours, going home, coming back, working long hours, that sort of thing. But as I got to just shy of exit 442 in Troutman, North Carolina, it's an area where there's nothing but, you know, farming and fields and that sort of thing. No houses really. I'm looking up and the weird thing is is my missing time occurred beforehand. But I look up out of the the windshield of my car, it's probably between 11:30 and 12:00 clock at night, and walking across the highway I see three men all walking in step across the highway. But the weird thing is they're all wearing monk robes, much like the lady that I heard on your special of the Mirrored Men. And when I heard this, my jaw hit the floor basically. So I just want you to know that this lady and I saw the same thing. Know if it's Mirrored Men, but it's certainly odd. But listen, love the podcast, love what you do. Keep doing it, man. We love it. All right, thank you for your time. Bye.
