[Speaker B] Hey, Derek, it's Eli calling from Virginia about a story that happened to me back when I was a volunteer firefighter. I was 17 at the time, and I had a Mustang, so I was faster to get to calls than everybody else that was at the station. So I was granted permission to get basically a permit saying that I could use a handgun and secure scenes before the rest of the department arrived. So we got a call one day about a house fire. And since I was still in school and stuff, I get going. I get into my car and I'm heading that way with my siren that I put up in my dash and my little black and pink helmet that the guys gave me. That's a whole other story. So I get there and I can tell the house is starting to burn. And right as I park, I can hear the fire truck coming up the street. So I go start securing the scene. And I had an issue one time where I bumped into another police officer while I was securing the scene for a house fire that we felt was arson. So I start going around, have my Colt.45 revolver, and I'm walking around looking, and right at the tree line, I see a pair of eyes. Early evening, the sun is just starting to set really good. So I think it's somebody there. So I shot my flashlight on him. I said, hey, you know, you need to come out. Well, it just sits there. So, like, okay, well, start getting a little bit closer. And as I start to get closer, I realized that the eyes are there and there's no real form to whatever I'm looking at. So I'm starting to realize it's not a person. So I have my light on it, and I get probably within six feet of whatever this is, and it starts to slowly go from this formless figure to a Figure that looks like an adult man standing about 6 foot tall. He's wearing older clothes, but not like 1800s, maybe like early 90s. So grab my gun, I pointed at him, not really sure what I'm about to do. And he just looks at me and he says, there's a kid in the house. And it just disappeared. That freaked me out to no end. But the words, there's a kid in the house running deep into me. So I go run to my chief and I said, hey, did y' all get everybody out of the house? There was a mom and a dad that were unconscious that were in the back of the ambulance. And they said, yes, we got everybody. I said, where's the kid? They said, what kid? So thankfully, one of the guys was fully packed out and he runs back in and a kid was hiding underneath his bed and they pulled him out. He was fine, thankfully. But that was a freaky and yet overwhelming experience to have some entity tell me, hey, you need to get the kid. Anyway, that's it for this call. I'll call back with more. Love the show, Derek. Keep it up. Bye.
