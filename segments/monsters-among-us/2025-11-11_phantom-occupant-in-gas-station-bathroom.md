[Speaker D] Hey, so something super strange just happened to me. I'm gonna keep it anonymous because it's so crazy. And once I get started, you'll understand why I want to keep my name out of it. So this morning I stopped by the gas station, had to get some gas for my work truck and go to the bathroom. So I go inside, and I'm waiting to use the stall. Now, I came in, it smelled, and I distinctly heard someone going to the bathroom. Like, I heard the toilet paper being ripped. I heard other various noises that sound like someone was in there going to the bathroom. I also heard some sniffling and just movement in the stall. And I was the only other person in there. So I'm waiting. Some people come in and out, and I decide to try and open the door so that they would know I was in there waiting to use it. I go to open the door, and it was unlocked. So I knock. Wait a second.

[Speaker C] Don't hear anything.

[Speaker D] So I open it, and there was no one there. And for a second I thought, you know, am I going crazy or something? Because I distinctly heard someone in there going to the bathroom. I heard all the sounds. I even heard the toilet flush when I was the only one in there. So at first I thought, well, maybe it was the women's bathroom.

[Speaker C] So once I get done and I.

[Speaker D] Leave, I look to see where the women's bathroom is, and it's on the complete opposite side of the gas station. And I thought maybe somebody slipped out while I was just on my phone. But when I went to use the stall, the toilet seat was cold. Not like the stereotypical cold when there's a ghost or something. Like, it was just cold. Like no one had been there. There was no, like, place for, like, workers, only around the men's room. It was just a bunch of, like, circuit breakers and stuff like that. So I don't know what happened. I don't know if I imagined hearing.

[Speaker C] Everything I did, But I also, you.

[Speaker D] Know, smelled, you know, like, that someone was in there using the bathroom. I don't know. This is the first time I've ever heard of someone having an encounter with a ghost using the bathroom. So, yeah, that's my story. Hope you can use it.
