[Speaker C] Hey Derek, it's Reese. So I know a big thing on the podcast I'm not sure about recently, but I know mirrored men and I had never had an encounter with mirror men until about eight months ago. And that was outside fishing. And I do a lot of fishing. We are in a very suburban area and there's always people walking their dog. And a lot of people know dogs have to sit sense they can see other stuff and sense stuff. Well, I always had very good connections with animals and all of a sudden this dog walked by and I was gonna pet it because I already knew this dog and it started biting at me, like snapping. Well, ten minutes before this I had saw three identical men and I could see through them. But the weird thing is I can see facial and they were walking down the street side by side, like in unison. And then all of a sudden they like disappeared. Like out of nowhere. They walked one more step and then boom, gone. And then they showed up right beside me and all of a sudden I was frozen. I Couldn't move. I was frozen in fear or. I don't know if it was fear or, like, you could explain it, like, if you're, like. Ever been held at gunpoint? I haven't personally, but I know a friend that was. And I was just frozen. I couldn't move. Like, I was trying to scream, but words couldn't come out of my mouth. And all of a sudden, I blink and they're gone and I can see again. The weird thing was, after that, my fishing stuff had been, like, torn open and emptied out all over the ground. And I'm not sure that was done by mirror men or vandals or whatever, but I was scared and I just gathered my stuff up and I ran. I ran home. But, yeah, thanks for the chance. It's Reese from Texas. Thank you.
