[Speaker B] Hi Derek, this is Michelle from Arizona and I figured I'd share this with you. I don't know if it counts as a paranormal story or supernatural. It's more of a light hearted and warming thing. It happened just a second ago, so I'm wanting to recall it as I felt it. But on my way to work I got into the parking lot and I sat in my car for a second just to breathe and get ready to go in and everything. And the sun is obviously right in front of me. I'm facing the east and it's coming up and it's just, I close my eyes and it hits me in such a way that I don't think I've ever felt the sun before. And this really warm and bright white light came onto me and I started to feel myself almost like ascending. And I honestly thought, is this what it feels like to die? And that kind of pulled me back in because obviously I wasn't dying and I'm not in any shape or position to be. But it was just so peaceful and heartwarming and I felt loved ones on the other side and I kind of wanted it to be the way I go. So anyway, thanks so much for the podcast. Keep it spooky, keep it safe. Bye.
