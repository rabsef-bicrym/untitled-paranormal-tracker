[Speaker B] Hey Derek, how you doing? This is Rafa again. I called back a few seasons ago with a UFO in Puerto Rico and I was living in San Juan. When I was living there in 2004, I was living on Moon Street, Calle Luna, on an old building from the beginning of the 20th century. But that particular night I was staying at my parents house south of there and what happened was I got a call around 2 in the morning from the number. It was a landline in the apartment. I picked up the phone and it was like, that's weird. I could only hear the ambient sound. I thought my girlfriend was there at the time. So I figured she somehow had pressed a button or something and called. So I didn't give it a second thought and I went back to bed, fell back asleep. And when I got up the next morning, I had several messages from the same phone number. That landline at the apartment where I live with my girlfriend. And I was. I couldn't figure it out. So I. When I got in touch with my girlfriend, she told me she had been gone all night and she had actually stayed at a friend's house because she knew I was staying at my parents house that night. And not only that, but she also got a message from the landline. And it was basically, I had a four minute message with just the ambient sounds of the apartment. She had like a two minute message with the ambient sound of the apartment. She thought that I had called and I thought that she had been calling. But neither of us was in the apartment and we didn't even have an answering machine. It was just a regular phone, like back in the day, like a landline just plugged into the wall. Now it was really weird because all in all we had about four messages from the landline. I had received one call where I had answered and yet nobody had been in the apartment. There was no answering machine. I mean, I just could not explain. I'm at a loss. I have no idea how to explain it. I wish I could say it was just an electronic malfunction. But the amount of calls, the messages, I had a four minute message, a minute and a half message and another 3 minute message and she had one 2 minute long message all around the same time, from 2 in the morning to 4 in the morning. Now the interesting thing is this building used to be a bravo is my understanding. So. And Moon street was notorious for being like the seedy part of old San Juan. There were a lot of brothels and speakeasies and that kind of stuff going on. So there were a lot of murders, a lot of disappearances. And you know, some of the most haunted buildings in old San Juan are in those two streets on Calle Luna and Calle Sol Luna and, and Salt street, which means sun street, to give you a little bit of context. For example, I used to work down the street in a really posh hotel that only had about 10 rooms. And the people that worked there, I was the only one there from 11 at night to 7 in the morning, the ladies that would come in in the morning to do the cooking and clean and housekeeping would stand outside the door and would not go into the building until the sun came out. They would wait for like 10, 15 minutes because they would not set foot in that building in the dark. Now I remember one time there was a big lounge room in the second floor with a library, a baby grand piano, some couches and all chairs so you could sit and read and hang out and listen to the piano playing and stuff. So I was the only person in the hotel. It was slow season, so there was not a single guest. Remember there's only 10 rooms. And I went and I mopped the entire lounge, these beautiful marbled floors. I mopped, went to put everything away. And when I came back, there were footprints on the wet mopped floor. Like somebody barefoot had just walked across the lounge. That creeped me out. And you know, things would move and you know, they would show up in other places and paintings would fall from the wall and break and stuff, like all kinds of weird stuff happen. But Old San Juan has a very old history, is built 500 years ago by the Spanish and has a lot of history, a lot of death and dying in that small walled in city. So no surprise or I have no doubt that it's full of spirits and, and so forth. I have no idea what it is. If you have any explanation, I would love to hear it. Anyways, keep up the good work and I hope I'll see if anybody can explain what happened. Take care, man. Keep up the good work.
