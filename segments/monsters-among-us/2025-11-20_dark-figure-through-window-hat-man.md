[Speaker C] Hey, Good evening Derek. This is Red from Bucks County, Pennsylvania. This was a story that I'm going to tell you that happened to me in about 20 some years ago, about 1997, 1998. I was about 10 or 12 years old. My bedroom was originally two rooms that we broke down a dividing wall and made it Instead of a 10 foot by 12 foot room, it was a 10 foot by 12 foot and an additional 8 foot by 10 foot room. So I had a very large room for a 12 year old. So that long part of that room, there was a far window and the foot of the bed faced that long part of the room. It's kind of hard to piece together the details, but what I can really remember on how it started was it felt like it was a sleep paralysis. I was dreaming, but I wasn't dreaming. I was dreaming about being in my room, but I was unsure of whether or not I was actually in a dream. And I can remember sleeping in my bed and in this dream or awake state of sleep paralysis, I can remember this thing coming through that far window. It was, Sorry, I'm shaking a little bit remembering this. It was tall, it was dark, and it didn't seem like it was a shadow. It felt like it just was the absence of light. It was a void, like it was there, but it wasn't there. And it kind of clipped in and out of reality. Like I could see through it, but I could still see that depth of emptiness inside of kind of floated. It had arms that had a face shape or a head shape, it had a torso, but it didn't seem to have anything below the knees. And I didn't really see that far because that was the foot of my bed. And it just kind of would creep towards me slowly. And I can remember its movement was very fluid, almost like it was just like sliding towards me like on a rope or something, you know. I don't recall it ever doing anything. But I do remember as it got close enough, I could see the door. And I always slept with my door open. And just before it got to where it was that point where your body knows there's no escape, I was able to just lunge up and head out the door. It would almost reach me. I could feel its presence. And I would just that split second I would make it, I'd run out into the living room, I'd run across the hall and I would head to my parents room at that point, I mean, it was bad, but I can remember it happening multiple times over multiple nights. And it was always the same way. Always came in through that window. And it wasn't like it would do anything, but it had that presence of pure evil or pure mystery. And I never wanted to get it any closer to me. I can remember my dad, when he finished my room, we were putting the door on and he put the doorknob on and he said, I'm gonna put the lock on the outside because I don't want me being inside the room and locking my door and having Something happen. So I always remember the lock was on the outside. I could say this. After about a week of this, maybe more, I finally had enough and I locked my room and I barricaded it and I went out in the living room and I slept on the couch for almost as far as I can remember. It felt like two weeks, three weeks. I can remember my cousins sleeping over my house and we would lay in the living room and watch that hallway towards my bedroom and just wait at night for something to come out. It never did. But the reason why it's so mysterious to me now is because I bought the house that I grew up in from my parents. And that room, we put that dividing wall back up and that additional 8 foot by 10 foot room is now used as just a day room for things. And the other room that was part of my bedroom is my son's room. And he sleeps in there. And what's Disturbing is now 20 some years later, he has had two encounters where he's told me that something has come out of his open closet. His closet has no doors, it's just an open bookshelf with closet, hanging rack. And he said one time something came out and it was a dark figure and it scared him. And I came in. We have a video monitor that keeps an eye on him at night and there was nothing there. And the second time he said something was standing at the foot of his bed and it was wearing a hat, it was a dark figure wearing a hat. And that hit me. It almost floored me at work. I was standing there and I heard one of your callers from possibly season five or six, and I'm sure it's come up again. But that dark figure wearing a hat. The hat man. But that was my story. I love the podcasts. Keep up the work, all that jazz. Have a good evening.
