[Speaker E] Hey. So this story starts when I was a teenager. I just randomly had this memory of being very little and my mom taking me out of the house to the end of the walkway. And there's a bunch of people all over the streets and on our property looking for something. I remember a really low helicopter that was really loud and my mom was crying like hysterically. My memory is that I was just really scared. I thought I did something wrong and so I started crying. That was into my memory. So when that memory came to me as a teenager, I asked my parents, like, what was that about? And my mom said that it was On Mother's Day, 1989, when I was like two and a half years old. I went missing from my home. The police were called. A neighborhood search party ensued. The police search helicopter was launched. My dad raced down to the wash to investigate. One of the neighbors said that they saw a couple adults and a kid down there by the wash. He went there, found the people. It was just like a couple people and a kid exploring. The police came to the house and searched like the complete police Protopolis search. I guess you're not supposed to just search with your eyes, but also with your hands. So they, like, put their hands on the bed and, you know, flung their hands out, like, touching the whole surface of the bed just to make sure there's nothing under the covers. They knelt down, looked under the bed, searched every crevice of the house, as police officers are trained to do when they're searching for a missing child. So a couple hours, two hours go by, they cannot find me. My mom is just hysterical. She's mentally fatigued. And so she goes to lay my sister down in her crib, which is in my same bedroom. And my mom sees my little feet poking out from under a blanket on the bed that was neatly made. So this blanket was covering my whole body except my two little feet. I've never slept like that before. The police searched that bed. She watched. The police officers searched the bed. She remembers the police officer's name, like, Officer Star. So my mom grabbed me out of the bed, and then that's when my memory starts. She runs outside to show the helicopters and everybody in the neighborhood that I had been found. So I asked them. I'm like, where was I? And she doesn't know. My dad also remembers the whole event. They do not remember where I was. My mom thought it was weird because the police officer, he must have been new and didn't know what to say, but he was like, maybe she was walking around outside by herself. And it's Mother's Day. Maybe a mom picked her up and took her for ice cream. I think it was just a weird thing that he didn't really think through. Just trying to calm an extremely scared mom. But, yeah, my parents definitely remember. I remember it. No one knows where I was. That's creepy. So I'm kind of wondering what your ideas could be, because I can't think of any. Thanks for the show and I love listening. Keep it spooky.
