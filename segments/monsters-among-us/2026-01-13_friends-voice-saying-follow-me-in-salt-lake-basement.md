[Speaker A] Hey, Derek. My name is Amber. I've been listening to your show for a couple of weeks now, and it's really triggering some memories that I've had. But today I just wanted to tell you about one in particular that really stuck out to me. So this happened in Salt Lake City, and It was about 12 years ago, maybe. I was staying with a friend of mine. I was there in Salt Lake for a convention. And he didn't have a spare bedroom. So I was sleeping in the basement on the couch. And I've always had kind of an aversion to basements because in the house that I grew up in, I always felt like I was being watched. Like, my entire life. Always felt uncomfortable in the basement. And I kind of felt this way in this basement, too, but I didn't really think anything of it. But when I was sleeping on the couch, I was kind of in a fetal position, and my body was turned towards the stairs, so I was facing away from the couch cushions. So in the middle of the night, I'm guessing it was probably somewhere between two and four. It was very quiet, and something woke me up. And so I kind of came to and I started hearing this shuffling. It was clearly footsteps shuffling on the carpet. And I knew it wasn't my friend because I just. My whole body. You know, when you get into those situations when you're around weird energy and, like, everything in my body just started to kind of prick. My solar plexus started going crazy, and I was just like, oh, my goodness. But the kicker is that it said, follow me. Wake up. And I just kind of curled into myself and said, nope. Said it in my mind. And I rolled over and kind of, like, scooted over towards the cushions. I didn't hear anything walk away. Nothing else happened. I went back to sleep. So the next morning, my friend came downstairs to check on me, and I asked him, I said, hey, do your girls whose bedrooms were in the basement? I said, have they ever said that they felt uncomfortable or anything? And his face turned white, and he was like, yes, they don't like coming down here. What happened? And I told him, and he was just like, oh, my gosh. But here's the crazy thing is it was his voice that said that to me. And I've heard things about, like, trickery, that sort of thing, like demons, like, showing up as little kids, that kind of stuff. I mean, I didn't sense that it was a demon, but I don't know. I mean, it was asking me to follow it, and I definitely did not have plans to do so. So I thought that was just kind of an interesting story that I wanted to share with you. And I love your show. I hope you stay well and thank you so much.
