[Speaker C] Hi, Derek. This is Lauren from the Detroit area. And, and I have called him before and I've actually had a call played on the show, which is the coolest thing ever, by the way. But I was just listening to the most recent episode and I think it was Jake's call about the mirrored men. And I feel like a lot of times when I hear these calls, I remember instances that have happened to me. So this was probably about 10 to 12 years ago. The person, the boy I was dating at the time, guy, whatever. I was really close with his family and his sister and I were the same age and we were friends and I was close with his mom. So I would often stay the night there and sleep on the couch or whatever. We'd crash out watching movies or TV or whatever. And I remember his sister telling me this story about how she would always see these three entities walking across the hall. And I was like, oh, you know, that's really creepy, you know, And I would tell her, you know, your house kind of creeps me out at night. Like I, I don't think it's haunted, but it's just like a really dark feeling. So one night I remember we had all kind of dozed off on the couch watching like a scary movie or whatever, which I love all things creepy spooky, so they never give me nightmares. But I remember waking up and it was probably about 2:30 in the morning and seeing these three cloaked figures cross the hallway. And I remember just kind of being like paralyzed with fear to the point where I like couldn't move. And I was just sitting there staring at them. And the next thing I knew, everyone was waking up. It was like 8 o' clock in the morning. And they were like, oh, what are we having for breakfast? Let's start coffee type of thing. And I just remember being like, did you guys just see that the, the three things walk across the hallway? No, No, I didn't see that at all. What are you talking about? And somehow I lost like five and a half, six hours, so just thought it was interesting. Love the podcast. Keep up the great work. Hope you can use this. Have a great night.
