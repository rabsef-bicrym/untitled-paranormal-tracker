[Speaker H] Hi, my name is Brett from southern Ohio. This happened about 2005. I was like kind of a bum. I mean I was in college, but I scheduled my classes till later in the day. So I got up about noon. Sunny day, fantastic outside. And my parents house is out in the woods about a quarter mile driveway. There's nobody else around. I'm just. There's these two French doors in front of the kitchen table. And that's where I decided to eat my breakfast. I'm just staring out there looking out in the woods. No Simmons is bright light. It looks like the only way I can describe is if somebody was holding a flashlight and making big circles with it. And then it just took off. And I was like, man, that's weird. No, I mean what is that? And I didn't think anything of it. And it wasn't even four or five seconds later it came back, started doing these big circles. I was getting kind of scared. I didn't, I didn't know what it was. There's nobody else around. It's just a random light. And it takes off again real quick. I don't know where it goes. Every time it takes off somewhere and it comes back, does more circles. And then it takes off for the last time. And I'm just sitting there. I didn't know if it was coming back. I didn't know what to do. And I was afraid to go outside. And I finally gathered the courage to go out there and where had been doing circles. As soon as I touched my foot out into the leaves of the forest to make a noise, two big bucks jump up right where that light was. And I don't know what it was doing. If it was looking at the deer, if it took the deer and brought him back, I have no idea what that light was. And that's my story. Thank you.
