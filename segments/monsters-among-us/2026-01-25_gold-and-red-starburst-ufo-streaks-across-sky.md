[Speaker B] Hi Derek, my name is Kenzie. I live in Salt Lake City, Utah. I love your podcast. I found you through Bigfoot Collectors Club and I'm really glad I did. I listen every week and I've been trying to catch up on the entire backlog of episodes and I am really enjoying it. So thank you for what you do. I wanted to tell you about something that I saw in Salt Lake City maybe two weeks ago. I looked it up and the experience that I had took place on September 9, which was like 2ish weeks ago, in downtown Salt Lake City. I was up on top of one of the taller buildings downtown having a grill out with a couple of friends and it was a super duper clear night, beautiful day, like perfect weather, pretty much sort of in between sunset and twilight. Like not really dark enough for shooting stars, but too light for stars to really show up yet at all kind of kind of thing. And I was sitting up there talking with a couple of friends and I was chatting with a friend of mine who was directly in front of me and in the sky right above him I saw this streak of color. All of a sudden it was like a gold sort of starburst with red on the outside of it and it streaked across like going from west to east in the sky from what I could tell anyways, and it was like one, two gone. It was super duper quick. Like by the time I realized it was happening and pointed and my friend turned around, it had already passed. It was really quick flash of color and light, but way too early in the evening for like shooting stars. It definitely wasn't a plane and it felt really, really close. Like maybe, I don't know, a Couple of hundred feet above us and was super interesting. And I, I mean, you could ask any of the people who were there. I kept bringing it up all night long, like, oh my gosh, I wish you guys would have seen that. That was so crazy. And I've been a big fan of like, paranormal stuff for a really long time. And this is the first real sighting that I've had. And I had tried to go back and look up if there had been like meteors that night or if other people had seen something. And I did pick up on a couple of like, oh, did you see that UFO result like today? Blah, blah, blah, kind of stuff on Instagram from a few friends that night, but that's about it. I didn't really find anything from like news outlets or anywhere that's a little more reputable. But anyways, again, thank you for the podcast. I really enjoy listening and I hope you have a good night. Thanks.
