[Speaker B] Hi, I'm calling from Houston, Texas, and I think I saw a ufo. I was driving past Ellington Airport a few nights ago, September 23, around 11pm when I saw four objects fly over my car. And from what I could tell, it was. Each one of them was a long, dark oval with a blinking light at the front end and the back end. And it was a blinking light like the running lights on an aircraft. But the thing is, on a regular aircraft, they're supposed to have those on the wings, and maybe on the top, there was just the two lights. And I stared at them for a while, and it was dark, but I did not see any wings on these. That was weird. Just a dark oval shape, four of them flying together. And they flew over the road, flew over the airport, and then they kind of swooped low over the airport and heading off in the horizon. And this is. This is going to sound straight up weird, but they were very flat. I saw that when they were swooping down, they were very flat. The way I would describe it is imagine the sole out of your shoe if it were flying like a magic carpet from Aladdin. I know how that sounds, but that's the visual. So yeah, long dark oval, a blinking light at the front and back and a yellow and white blinking light. I looked up pictures of running lights for aircraft and helicopters and drones and I couldn't see anything like that. And the reason I mentioned this was Ellington Airport is that's an airport that there's military and NASA aircraft flown out of there. But I can't see why the military would be testing over a city or why NASA would be flying during the day, but throwing that out there. Alright, thank you. Love the podcast.
