[Speaker B] My name is Sarah. I'm calling from Tucson, Arizona. I was actually just hearing the podcast girl Ash called regarding the lights in the sky. Well, I have seen that too. I live around the area where she had described that she was driving. I was sitting outside one evening, this must have been maybe about eight, nine years ago. My cousin and I were sitting on a porch and while she was talking to me, I had seen some lights in the sky and they were appearing, fading out. I didn't see anything that they were coming up from the ground. It was definitely in the sky. Now, where it was coming from, there's a huge telescope. So I don't know if that has anything to do with it. I told my cousin, look, there's going to be some lights that appear there. So she looked really quick and she saw them. They appeared and all of a sudden they bursted into maybe eight to 10 different lights and just disappeared altogether. So I did want to validate that I've seen what she's seen before. Thank you so much. I love this podcast so much. I've listened to it for years and I've gotten my sisters all on this podcast. Thank you so much.
