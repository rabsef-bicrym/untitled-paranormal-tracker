[Speaker J] So my story is actually from my aunt, my mother's sister. She's a nurse in her early 60s and sometimes she works in the night shift at a care facility with overnight patients. A little while ago, she experienced something that has completely baffled everyone who works there. On one of her night shifts, she and another nurse were working together. There's a small staff room in the back building that only employees have access to. No patients ever go in there. It's just a small square room with a few windows and a fridge where they keep their lunches, and a single door that opens inward at some point during the night. My aunt went to grab her food from the fridge for her break, but when she tried to open the door, which you have to like push it into the room to open, the door wouldn't move more than about 4 inches. Something was blocking it from the inside. So she pushed harder and realized that the refrigerator itself had somehow been moved across the room and was now sitting directly in front of the door, blocking it completely. And this fridge is heavy. It's not something you can just slide around. It normally stands to the right of the room, several feet away from the door. Somehow it had been moved all the way over and positioned perfectly so that the door could only open a few centimeters. My aunt and her co worker had to use all their strength to push the door open just enough to squeeze inside. When they finally got in, they expected to find someone, maybe a patient, trying to hide or escape, but no one was in there. They were thinking that maybe a patient had broken into the room, maybe barricaded the door with the refrigerator, and then jumped out of the window, even though it was the second floor. So that would seem very unlikely. But when they entered the room, no one was in there. And all of the windows were closed from the inside. And nothing really looked disturbed except from the fridge. There wasn't even a sign that anyone could have entered or exited. And again, it was a restricted room and no patients had any reason to be there. They checked everything. The floor wasn't wet or slippery. The fridge wasn't malfunctioning. It was just moved Somehow. A few weeks after my aunt told me this story, she told me there was another part to the story because about a week or two later, another nurse went into that same room. And there's a mirror on the wall. And as she looked into the mirror, she saw a person standing behind her in the reflection. But when she turned around, no one was there. And this all happened in a fairly new building, not some old creaky hospital with like crooked floors or anything that would make the fridge slide. So there's no explanation. Like, it's just so creepy, I think. And nothing like this has ever happened before. Since my aunt isn't really someone who believes in the supernatural. I'm not from a religious family. She's not religious. In Denmark, people aren't super spiritual. But after that night, I think that she doesn't really know what to think and I don't know what to think about this story. So maybe you have an explanation or. I don't know. But thank you so much, Derek. I really love your podcast. Bye.
