[Speaker B] Hi Derek, my name is Morgan. I'm a first time caller and I.

[Speaker C] Was really excited for this sighting so that I could give you a call.

[Speaker B] I'm from Colorado but I saw this May 2, 2024 in California. I was at Harbin Hot Springs. I had arrived with three friends earlier in the day around 6pm and it's important to note for the story that we were all sober, we had no drugs or alcohol in our systems. We had finished soaking and Harbin Hot Springs has a set of cabins. It's tucked into a little valley and it's a beautiful hot spring and the cabins were kind of up towards the top of this little nook, this little valley and our cabin had a porch on the back of it that faced south and I could tell because the sun had set to the right of us and the sun came up obviously to the left of us that next day. So we are sitting out on the back porch and we took note of the time.

[Speaker C] It was 9:07.

[Speaker B] We were all sitting there, we all Saw this. And traveling from west to east over the top of this area, we saw what looked like a dandelion puff of light. It looked like the pinpoints of light were being seen through fog, the way that water or fog kind of refracts light. But it was a perfectly clear night. There were no clouds in the sky. We estimated it to be maybe 3 to 500ft up. And the way that we could kind of tell this is as it kind of moved past us over the course of a couple of minutes. It seemed like we could see it from different angles and maybe see a little more dimensionality than you'd be able to see from something that's really, really high up in the sky. The light traveled pretty slowly, and it was really windy and very gusty. So it felt like if it had.

[Speaker C] Been a balloon or something like that, it would have been moving around a lot.

[Speaker B] Even a drone would have been pushed potentially off course. This maybe gave a couple of tiny.

[Speaker C] Wiggles, but it wasn't moving with the.

[Speaker B] Wind, and it was also silent. All three of us identified it. As it moved towards our left to.

[Speaker C] The east, we could kind of see.

[Speaker B] It looked like almost butterfly wings, the way that the lights were coming off of it. And it looked like there was a tail of lights that had more solidity to them, like they were short. So it looked like a dandelion with a stem almost. But it was of light and it traveled.

[Speaker C] So it was kind of small, but.

[Speaker B] It didn't wink out. It, like, got really tiny. So it's like it had traveled maybe to the bottom of the valley, and then all of a sudden, it was very small, like it almost blinked out. But we could still see it for another minute or so.

[Speaker C] But it was just this tiny little light.

[Speaker B] That's all that we were able to see. And I hope that there's a different explanation, but it was really interesting, and I was really excited to get to see a ufo. Thanks for everything. You and your team do have a great night.
