[Speaker D] What's up, all you wacky weirdos out there? This is Alex coming at you from Detroit, Michigan. I recently watched your documentary, Derek the High Desert One. Man, that was an epic film. And in that, there's a scene which brought this out of me. So in the scene, this guy's talking about how he's on the highway and he sees these two lights that come up at him and he thinks they're ufo. Like that very same thing happened to me one morning driving from Detroit to Charlotte. I was going to work.

[Speaker C] It was about 6:30 in the morning, pitch dark. I'm the only one on the road. And I'm driving down the road and.

[Speaker D] I look in the rear view and it looks like there's a freaking car. I see two lights coming right at me. This thing looks like it's going 130, 140 miles an hour.

[Speaker C] And it comes so fast.

[Speaker D] It did a quarter mile, half mile, mile in seconds. So I saw this and immediately I just braced for impact because it got so close. I thought for sure this dude's gonna hit me. He's coming right in and he's gonna freaking whack me. So all I remember is like, bracing.

[Speaker C] Closing my eyes and like wincing.

[Speaker D] And then nothing happened. And I opened my eyes and there was nothing there. There was no car.

[Speaker C] There was nothing there. And this happened. I thought about it.

[Speaker D] I thought it was just a crazy driver until I saw that scene in your documentary. Then I realized, no, man, there was no car. There was nothing there. That was too fast, too eerie, and too weird. Anyways, love your show, man. I hope to hear some wacky ones.
