[Speaker D] Hey, Derek. I live in Milford, Michigan, and when we first bought my house, so this was probably two years ago and it was probably around fall, me and my daughter, who at the time was four, went out behind our house to this trail. And it kind of wasn't a huge plot of woods, but it was a good space. So we were walking around and it was starting to get dusk. And at that time, I think it actually was like, dark. We started to see, like, trees moving all around us and like trees or leaves falling off and trees moving around. And then I would say 10ft away. And this is really dense forest. So, like, you couldn't see, especially in dark, you know, more than a couple feet. And we heard this. The loudest, deepest snarl growl I've ever heard. Like, not like a dog. It was. I don't even know how to explain it. And my daughter immediately started screaming and crying. And so I told her to run back to the house. And I didn't want to turn away because I know you don't turn away from predators. So I slowly backed up, but it took off crashing. And it was. Whatever it was, was extremely large. My daughter still brings it up. She had nightmares. She constantly checks to make sure the door's locked. She doesn't want to sleep alone. It terrified her. I mean, it scared me. It was again, like a loud, deep. Like you could almost feel it, like a snarl and then a growl. And I've had large dogs. I'm used to that. It was, I mean, way different than a dog. So I don't know what it was. Again, that's in Milford, Michigan, about two years ago. And I would say it was probably 7 o' clock at night. I was listening to one of your other shows and it kind of reminded me of that. And she still brings it up all the time, my daughter. It kind of traumatized her. I just thought I'd give you a call and let you know. Thanks. Bye.
