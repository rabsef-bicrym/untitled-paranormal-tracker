[Speaker B] Hi, Derek, it's Jessica. I live in Canada, in Quebec, kind of in a rural area in the Gatineau park area of Quebec. I'm calling today because I heard a story where someone had reported seeing something like a translucent bat, and it was the first time I Was kind of excited about what me and my husband had seen four or five years ago. So I thought I would tell my story and see if it was at all close to the same sighting. So my husband and I were visiting my parents in Ottawa, Ontario and they live in a, you know, not a suburban area. It's like quite city esque and an older neighborhood. And we were both smokers at the time. So we went outside after dinner with our drinks and we went out in the backyard, a tiny backyard, you know, close to all the other backyards. We sat out and had a cigarette and chatted. It was around probably 10:30pm, really nice night, not cloudy, fairly clear. I didn't notice it was windy or anything, although it's been a while now, so I can't remember too many details. And as we were chatting about God knows what, I look up to my left above the horizon like beside my parents neighbor's house and I see this, what looks like a V shaped big pair of wings moving in this like kind of mechanical way, like they're flapping but they're like illuminated. I couldn't see really a body, just the wings, like the way you would like draw arches for a seagull. And I saw them and I told my husband, hey, do you see that? Like what is that? Is it a drone? And we look and he's dumbfounded and so am I. And we're just kind of looking at it. It's kind of shaky, flapping, mechanical, very high up in the sky, but not high enough where it would be like plane height, I can't gauge, maybe you know, 100ft, 150ft, I don't know. And it was moving away from us and then all of a sudden another one appeared right beside it, kind of in tandem and they were both flapping and moving away from us and we just watched them in total awe, having zero clue what it could be. It didn't look like a drone, it didn't look fully mechanical. It looked like it was, I don't know, almost like it was an animal. But also this illuminated, mechanical jerking motion. I've never seen anything like it. I've never seen anything like it again. And we both looked at each other and thought this is definitely a UFO of some kind. So I did tons of research to try and find any like Google description that might be the same. And I couldn't find anything at all that looked UFO wise like anything we had seen. And it was only when I heard that story about the kind of translucent bat sighting that I thought, oh, that's kind of really similar to, at least visually what we saw. I don't know if the motions were the same, but certainly visually sounded really similar. And when I saw the picture, I thought, okay, from far away, that's probably really similar to what we were looking at. So that's my story. I hope it's useful. Thanks again for everything. Have a great day. Bye.
