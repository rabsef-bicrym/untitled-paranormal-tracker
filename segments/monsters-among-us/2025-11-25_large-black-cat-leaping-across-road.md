[Speaker B] Eric, what's up? This is Pete, Southeast Alabama. I have a very, at least in my mind, credible black cat story that I wanted to share with you guys. Back in the fall of 2020, I was working a part time job reading water meters for Henry county in Alabama, more specifically the city of Abbeville. I had gotten up this one particular morning to go read the meters. I always kind of prepare myself. It was a once a month situation, so I would go to bed early the night before and usually get started right around the crack of dawn. At least get in my car and head that way. I live about 40 minutes from where I would do the work. So this particular morning it was a brisk fall morning, very clear out. I want to say it was maybe 7:15 ish in the morning, so sun had already come up. I had really good visibility. I had turned on the road that would carry me back that way just outside Eufaula, just crossing into the city limits of Abbeville. So the street that I was traveling down had really large corn. It was Grown up probably 5 or 6ft on both sides of the road. As I'm driving roughly 15 to 20 yards in front of me, I see some movement in the brush on the side of the road. Kind of catch it out the corner of my eye and out I see an animal that I can only describe as a large black cat. Take one leap from off the side of the median of the road, jump into the center line of the road and take one leap from the center line of the road into the brush on the other side of the street. So basically the cat was able to, because I guess it was running full speed at the time, able to clear the entire road in one leap. Just so you kind of have an idea why I feel so strongly that this was what it was. I'm an owner of a large Connie Corso. This dog's about 135 pounds. Whatever this cat was, I would guesstimate was at minimum size of my dog, a little larger if I had to say. And when it was outstretched in its full leaf, it had to be close from, you know, tail to front feet, roughly 8ft. It had a long tail, very muscular body. I know for certain. I saw what I saw, man. We love the podcast. You are the man. Thank you so much for what you do. Have a good one.
