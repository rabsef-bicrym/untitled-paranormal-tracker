[Speaker D] Hi, Derek, my name is Bob. I'm calling you from the Detroit, Michigan area. So I just listened to an episode where a caller was talking about her and her husband. I think hearing native American flute music while her friend and her husband didn't reminded me of my story. So I'm a professional musician and I teach music lessons as well. So one day I go to the place where I teach music lessons. I'm upstairs and it's very early, so I'm the only one there besides the guy who ran the place. And I could hear a violin playing. So obviously it's not that shocking to hear a violin playing in a music lesson studio, but we didn't have a violin teacher at the time. So I walked around to every room. There was nobody there but the guy who ran the place. I walked into his office, I asked him if he heard the violin, and he looked at me with a horrified look on his face and said, yeah, do you hear it too? So we looked in every studio. We couldn't find it. There was a bar downstairs from us which was like an R and B hip hop bar, but they weren't open, but we walked down there anyway. The doors were closed. There was nobody inside. There were no cars in the parking lot. So to this day, I have no idea where this violin music was coming from. The radio was not on in the music studio. The guy that was in the office was just sitting there doing work on his computer. There was no radio on. There were no windows open. We were kind of set off the road pretty far back off the road, actually. So even if somebody had music playing in their car with their windows down, we wouldn't hear where we were. I've never been that frightened in my life because that music wasn't coming from anywhere. But we both heard it perfectly clear. So that's my story. Love the podcast. Keep it spooky. Thanks.
