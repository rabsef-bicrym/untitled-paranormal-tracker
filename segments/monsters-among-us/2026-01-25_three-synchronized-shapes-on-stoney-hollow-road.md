[Speaker D] My name is Will and I'm from Iowa. I grew up on a road named Stoney Hollow, and there's a lot of a Lot of stories around these parts about that road. Most of them have to do with Indian ghosts and stuff like that. That's. That's not what my story's about, though. I just listened to your episode three, where a man described seeing three strange shapes moving in, moving in sync with one another. And it reminded me of something similar I experienced on that road back in the early 2000s or late 90s as a child. I was looking out the window of my house and this is. This is in the middle of nowhere. Nearest house is a couple miles away, just gravel road, woods. It was probably midnight or 1am and I look out the window and I see three shapes. Well, actually, I see one shape step onto the road, into the light, and then it steps forward and another shape is behind it. And then they both step forward and then a third shape. And these three forms walked across the road. They were bipedal, but they moved really oddly. And I couldn't place what it was at first.

[Speaker E] And then I realized that they were moving in tandem.

[Speaker D] All their movements were mirrored. And about the time I realized this, they stopped. And I could only see their silhouettes in the moonlight. Just three dark, similar shapes. But when they stopped, I could tell that they were looking at me. Or at the very least, they felt they were being watched and they were looking for what was looking at them. And that is one of the most terrifying moments of my life. I. I don't remember much past that. That is nearly the extent of the memory. The road was maybe a quarter mile away from the house, maybe a bit less, but it was not far. But it also was not terribly near either. And I was not pressed up against the window. I was. I was back about a foot at least. But that is my story. And after hearing the other person relate his story of the three synced things which gazed at him, brought it back into. Brought it back in the forefront of my mind. Something I hadn't thought about in a long time. But I just want to leave that story for you. Bye.
