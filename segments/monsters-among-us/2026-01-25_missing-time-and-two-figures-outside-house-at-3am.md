[Speaker D] Hi Derek, this is Lisa from Minneapolis and I have a story for you. I lived in a small town in the 80s in Kansas. I lived in a small house and by the way, I've had many experiences with paranormal but this one puzzles me to this day. It was a hot night. I had big windows open in my tiny house, in my bedroom and before I went to sleep I left a note for my boyfriend on the front door. He was playing cards with some friends and was going to come by later. So mind you, we never locked doors. There was never any crime in the town so it felt pretty normal to do that. And by the way, I was also like 19. I went to sleep reading a book, windows wide open. Super hot, muggy muggy night. I was just laying on top of my covers reading. About three in the morning my roommate came in and she had a bald bat and she was freaking out and she says oh my God, somebody's outside, there's some people outside of her house. And I said turn off the light. So she turned the light off. I went to the window, I looked out and there were two figures. They were Kind of scaling the house. And then they ran down the alley. And I was just like, what the hell? Who the hell was that? And we thought, well, it's just two guys from high school. You know, they just seem like the type that would do it. But I just thought, well, that must have been two guys that we knew or something. So went back to bed. Didn't really think too much about it. And then I realized my boyfriend wasn't there. So the next day I called him, and I'm like, why didn't you come over? What was going on? He goes, I did, and you weren't there. And I said, shut up. I said, no way. I was sleeping. He said, no, you weren't. He said, I came over and I could tell you were in your room. Your windows were open, your light was on, everything. He goes, and I just sat on the front stoop and waited for you, thinking maybe you walked down to get some cigarettes or something. So I smoked a couple cigarettes and waited. Never came. And I was just like, what are you talking about? I said, I was there. You know, I was just freaked out because where could I have been? I was in my bed. And then I said, okay, what did the note say? And he told me what it said, word for word. So. Just freaked me out. Anyway, I just kept thinking, you're kidding me. You're kidding me. And he wasn't a person to do that. You know, he could trust him and knew he wouldn't mess around with me. So about five years later, was at a wedding, and I saw him, and I just said, this is really bothering me. Are you sure that you didn't. Are you sure you're not kidding? And he said, no, no, I'm not. I swear to God, I was not kidding. You were not there. And I still see the whole scene so perfectly, and I'm still so freaked out by it. But that was just one freaky thing that's happened to me out of hundreds. I have so many stories that I don't know why, but my girlfriend says that I'm a vessel for the paranormal. So, I don't know, maybe I am. It wasn't quite unusual to have something strange happen. So thank you for letting me tell my story. This is kind of fun, finally being able to tell somebody that gets it. Okay, bye. Bye.
