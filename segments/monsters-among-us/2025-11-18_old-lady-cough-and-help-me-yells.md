[Speaker B] Hey yeah, I'm calling about two episodes I had years ago in and around Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. My name is Eric. I had a job I was doing working on a triplex in Carnegie. It was like a huge mansion from, like, you know, 100 years ago. Big building. And the owner worked with computer firm and he wanted the whole top floor renovated and had done, you know, carpeting, painting, the whole floor, all new kitchen. And I remember doing the plumbing. It was like an open floor plan too, so there was no real doors or anything. But the stairs were in the center, wrapping around, going all the way up. And every time I'd go into work, I would like, you know, close the door and lock it behind me because the other tenants, I didn't want them, you know, coming in or whatever. And I remember working under the sink in the kitchen and I heard an old lady cough, like from that center stairway. I could tell exactly where it's coming from. And the hair on the back of my neck stood up and it just felt really weird, odd. And I just kept working and tried ignoring it. Eventually, in like a minute or two, I remember, like turning up the radio so I couldn't hear anything else. And then, you know, probably like 10 minutes later, 15 minutes later, I went down the stairs to make sure the door was closed and locked still. And it was. Yeah, that was it. You know, nothing really crazy there. Just really odd and weird. And that was about 25 years ago, another episode I had about 11, 12 years ago. I was working for HUD for a senior housing development outside the city in Lawrenceville. It was an eight story high rise and they were renovating. If you could envision a building eight stories tall and about 20 units on each floor, and they would like split the whole building in half and they would demolish and renovate each floor, going up on one side, and then people would move in and then people would be living on the other side. And then we would pick up their belongings and move them into the renovated half. And then they would demolish and renovate from the top going down on the other side. And this was at a stage I believe was a third floor on the second phase, where I had to move a resident's belongings from the side of that building to another unit. And I remember boxing up belongings and, you know, picking up furniture, putting them on carts. I was working alone and I heard it was like a yell, scream, like, help me, help me. But it was weird. It was like through a megaphone, through a radio. It wasn't like a real, you know, like Person calling, but, you know, somebody help me, you know? And, yeah, I was the facilities manager there, so I had a passkey, master key, and I went to every room on that floor looking for the person that, yo, help me. Help me. And I went to every room and nobody was home. I went upstairs, downstairs. But, you know, the sound I heard was, like, pretty close. Yeah, that really freaked me out, because previously I would always hear, you know, stories or rumors. I remember one resident saying, like, she would get a knock on the door every night between, like, 2 or 4 in the morning, and she would look through the little, you know, peephole, and nobody there. And I would hear different stories about people seeing stuff. And that's just another weird little experience I had. Can't explain it. That's about it.
