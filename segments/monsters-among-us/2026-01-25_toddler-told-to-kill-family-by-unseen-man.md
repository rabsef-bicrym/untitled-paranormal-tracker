[Speaker B] Hi everyone, this is Mickey from Springfield, Oregon. I have a short story for you. At the time of this occurrence I was living in Durham, California which is a small farming community just outside of Chico, California. I lived in a fifth wheel trailer at the time on the property that belonged to my son in law's parents. My daughter and son in law lived in a house on the property. The house was very old, I'm not sure how old exactly. I would guess early 1900s. The property was a huge almond orchard and incidentally the property was once part of the Leland Stanford Junior Farm. This happened in probably late 2013. My son in law's mother and her family had lived in that house for for a time when her kids were smaller and she had urged me to sage the house for safety of our granddaughter. So I did it. She also said that she thought her husband's grandmother was there. She used to live in the house when my granddaughter was very small. She hated having her diaper changed and she would cry through the process. But if we changed her on the changing table in her bedroom, she wouldn't cry but she'd stare at the center of the room and sometimes even coo or smile like she was interacting with someone or something. When she was about two and a half, I was babysitting one night and I put her to bed in her room and was reading a book in the living room. The baby monitor was on but I could also hear her through the open door. It had been very quiet for about 20 minutes or so and I really thought she was sleeping all of a sudden as plain as day. She said no, but I don't want to kill my mommy, my daddy and my grandma. Needless to say I was alarmed so I jumped up and I went in there to see who she was talking to and there was no one there. So I asked her who she was talking to and she said the man. She didn't know any more than that. She just said the man and she was kind of upset so I prayed really hard for protection over her and over that room. And the next day I saged again and I felted the perimeter and she didn't do that anymore. I didn't tell my daughter what happened exactly. I only asked if she had heard my granddaughter talking to anyone in her room and she said yes a few times but she didn't elaborate to my knowledge. She didn't talk to anyone else after that. Thanks for your podcast and thanks to everyone for listening. Bye.
