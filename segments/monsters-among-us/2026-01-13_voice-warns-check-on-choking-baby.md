[Speaker C] Hello. My name is Nora Gower and I live in Rock Island, Tennessee. I lived with my family in Nashville before we moved out of at Rock Island. And this is where this story takes place. So I've just had my fourth baby and I am just doing dishes or doing something, you know, got four kids. So phone rings and I'm talking to my mother in law. I had just had my youngest one, and she's calling, you know, checking up on me, hey, how's the baby? As our conversation ends. And I said, oh, nanny, he's doing good. He's sleeping right now. And we hang up. After I hang up, I hear like a little voice saying, go check on him. And I'm thinking, well, little voice, he's such a light sleeper, I'll wake him up. I'm arguing with a voice, right?
