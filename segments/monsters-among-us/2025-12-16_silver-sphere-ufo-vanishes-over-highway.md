[Speaker C] Hey Derek, this is John in Antwerp, Ohio. Wanted to share a story that happened to me about a year ago, roughly April, May of last year. It was first thing in the morning, 7:30, taking off, going to work. And I'm driving from Antwerp, Ohio to Fort Wayne, Indiana. And there's a stretch of highway called 24. And as I was driving up this highway, you go over this overpass. And as I was coming up on top of this overpass. I look off into the sky and it's a bright blue, beautiful, beautiful day out. And you can see for miles in the sky. It's very flat in this part of the country. And I'm looking off into the left and I see this silver ball in the sky. And I was, like, dumbfounded. I was like, what in the world is that thing? And I just looked at it, and then I looked back at the road, and then I looked back at it. I look back at the road and then this silver ball, like, almost turned to a point where, if you can imagine having someone shine like a watch light in your eyes, like using the sun and shining that light in your eyes. It's almost like that silver sphere, like, shined its light into my eyes. I remember just blinking and then looking back at the road and then looking back to find where it was. It had vanished. It was gone. I didn't see it take off. I didn't see it move. I don't know if it went up. I don't know if it went somewhere else or over my head or something, but I didn't see it at that point. But it was this big silver sphere in the sky. And I was obviously, you know, dumbfounded by that experience. I'd never seen anything like that. But then, you know, listening to the show, I've heard, you know, multiple silver spheres or even black spheres in the sky. So very interesting story. Felt the urge to share it. Appreciate the show. Keep up the great work.
