[Speaker G] Hey Derek, thanks for the entertaining podcast. My name is John, and if I had to describe myself, I would say that I'm a lifelong skeptic in all of this, but I'm still always hunting Bigfoot or wanting it to be real. So cryptids have always been kind of entertaining to me more than anything else. But the one thing that I have to say that has struck me more than anything is the mirrored men stories. And I don't know why that is. Every single time I relate, retell the story or hear the story, it gives me shivers and it strikes me in like a primal part of my fear centers. And I don't really know exactly why that is, other than the fact that I might be psyching myself out. Well, I have somewhat of a story from that area, and I wanted to relay it. It's actually from your neck of the woods. I grew up in, in Lake Arrowhead in the San Bernardino Mountains, and a lot of days up there are covered in fog, as you probably know, being from around that area now and that fog, a lot of people up there that have grown up there kind of view it with a little bit of suspicion, won't go out into it, and will tell stories about the fog or kind of something that kids are scared of. And I don't really know what the reason for that is. We don't really have like a boogeyman that you know in that area that I know of, but I think that might originate from people being scared to drive in it, especially among along the rim. It's a pretty treacherous stretch of road, and we've all. Anyone that's grown up there knows several people that have lost their Lives driving off that road. So it's kind of, you know, a bit of a, bit of a bad omen to have the fog covering. In Lake Arrowhead there is a place called Strawberry Peak. And Strawberry Peak is kind of a place that teenagers go hang out, smoke cigarettes, sometimes make out. It's like the make out point. And off and on. Throughout my childhood and high school years, you've been able to either drive all the way up to Strawberry Peak or periodically they put up gates that people will bash down eventually. So it was, it was hit or miss. If there was a gate up there, you're able to drive all the way to the point. And the top of Strawberry Peak is a fire lookout point that is sometimes used, sometimes not. So usually there's nobody up there. So I had three friends that went to Strawberry Peak and were not able to drive all the way. There was a gate there and there's a short trail that goes from the gate around the opposite side, not along the road to get to Strawberry Peak. And a lot of people use that trail. The, these three friends had used them before, knew the area pretty well. They all grew up there, but the fog had been rolling in, so everything was a little bit dark, a little bit foggy and they somehow got separated. And my one friend, she got a little bit farther away from everyone else and started hearing a low humming or one of those low pitched noises that you can barely audible to the human ear and was kind of like, what the heck is that? I've never heard something like that. Maybe it's the radio tower up the top. Kept on walking, but couldn't really see the other two friends. So she called out to them and they didn't respond and made her a little bit nervous. And so when she was walking on this trail, she came up against three identical looking figures. And the way that she described it to me was they looked like they were hooded. They didn't look at her, they didn't really do anything. But it scared the hell out of her seeing these three hooded figures with their backs to her in the middle of nowhere in the, in the dark forest. So she quickly, as quickly as she could and as quietly as she could, walked from that area. Just, just tried to get back down to the cars. When she got back down the cars, mind you, this is probably about 200 yards. Not even, couldn't be more than 400 yards. When she got back down to the cars, the other two friends were frantic. They were like, where the heck were you? We've been calling out to You. It's been like a half an hour of us searching for you. Where were you? We've been up and down the trail several times. And she was like, what are you talking about? I was just up the trail just a little bit ahead of you. And I came right back down. It couldn't have been more than five minutes when we were around a campfire when she told me this story. And I then related the Mirror Men story that has been the bane of my existence. And it made her stop and think of the similarities, the time loss. Now, this friend is someone that I trust pretty much implicitly and would never. I've never known her to be an exaggerate anything. I think she truly, she truly saw something out there. Whether that is the Mirrored Men or not, I don't know. Whether it was just some kids having some seance out there, I don't know. But what struck me was the loss of time and that there was three of them that was the same similarities. The three that were all looked the same, all identical in appearance, at least from the back in clothing and the lost time. So with those similarities, I thought I would share this story since it was again, from your neck of the woods. Now, welcome to the area. I've since moved from Lake Arrowhead, but I always think back fondly of that place. So I just wanted to share my story. Yeah, thanks.
