[Speaker B] Hi Derek, I would like to remain anonymous on this one, but I am calling from the Detroit area and I just have something kind of strange that happened to me just last night. I was asleep and we live in a house that was built in the 80s and it was built by the previous owner. So there's, you know, nothing terrible happened there that we know of. We've never had any sort of experience whatsoever. But last night, we have two dogs and three cats. And my husband had fallen asleep in my son's room with him. And my daughter was in her room, and I was in our bedroom. And I had one of the dogs in there with me. And I woke up, it was 2:52am I remember looking at my clock, 2:52am and my dog was ferociously growling. And that has never happened. She's usually pretty quiet. And I kind of zoned myself in, like, okay, what's. What's she growling at? And there was a man standing in my doorway of my bedroom. You know, we sleep with all the doors open because our. Our children are small. And there was a man, and he wasn't very tall. My husband is, so I knew it wasn't my husband. My husband's six six, so he's a very distinguishable height, this man. I could very clearly see that it was a man. He was dark. There was no face. There was no features I could make out other than this entity looked like they were built like a man. Like, there was no, like, long hair, had, like, broader shoulders. So I assume that it was a man. And my dog is growling ferociously. And I don't know that that's not even the weirdest part, because the weirdest part is it was overwhelming, this sense of dread. Like, I just felt sad and awful and terrible and just any negative feeling you could describe, I felt. And I wanted to break down and cry. I wanted to just bury my head, and I kind of just shook my head and what the hell is going on? Is what I'm thinking. And next thing I know, he's gone and the dog is looking at me just as confused as I am. And, yeah, that was it. I woke up and I kind of tried wrapping my head around it because I went back to sleep, kind of not. Not realizing I had fallen back asleep so quickly. And I woke up and I felt off. But, you know, I made it through my day, and I don't know. I don't have anywhere else to be. Share this where people would understand, but hope you can use this in your show. I. I love your show. I listen to it every week, and, yeah, I hope this is something you can use and, you know, be safe out there to everyone. All right, bye.
