[Speaker C] My name is Nancy and I'm calling you from Indiana. This happened back in the year 78 or 79.

[Speaker D] I can't recall which, and there's a.

[Speaker C] Lot of details that now remain fuzzy to me, but I'll tell you what happened. I went to a baby shower with a friend of mine and we attended the shower. And then on the way back, we.

[Speaker D] Were coming back through the country and.

[Speaker C] There was a bright yellow light that.

[Speaker D] Seemed to be following us.

[Speaker C] And it got closer and closer until.

[Speaker D] It almost looked like a sun.

[Speaker C] And.

[Speaker D] It looked like it was going to engulf us. And we sped up and sped up and sped up and finally we got away from it.

[Speaker C] But I will never forget that as.

[Speaker D] Long as I live. It looked like a sun was getting ready to swallow us up, and we were terrified.

[Speaker C] But I've never seen anything like it since. And that's my story.
