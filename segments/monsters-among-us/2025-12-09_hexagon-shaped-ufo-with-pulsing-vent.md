[Speaker E] Hello, Derek. My name is Mary, and I'm calling from Virginia. However, even though I'm calling from Virginia, my story actually takes place in Massachusetts, the South Shore. That's the area between Boston and the Cape. And this took place in the 90s. I was a teenager at the time, like an older teenager. I was in a car with my dad and my stepmother. And it was about dusk, and we were driving to my mom's place where my dad was gonna drop me off. Suddenly my dad's like, what's that? I see something in the sky. I look out the window, and I think it's like a low flying aircraft. At first, however, my dad's kind of spooked. And the thing is, my dad is not an easy to spook type of guy. He has, like, a background in science, so he is very skeptical about these things. But it scared him enough that he pulled over, he got out of the car, and my stepmother can see it because she's, like, sitting next to him. And I'm in the back. I can't quite see it. She's like, tommy, please don't go. Don't go out there and look. My dad was just like, I want to know what that is. So he got out of the car and he starts staring up at the sky. I can't get a really good look at it. So I get out. My stepmother is protesting, but I want to see what my dad's looking at. As I get out. I see. At first, like I said, I thought it was an aircraft, but it was not a plane. It couldn't have been a plane. It was hexagon shaped, and it was very big. And I could see kind of some lights blinking, which is why I thought it was a plane at first. But I knew it definitely wasn't a plane because of how low it was flying and how big it was. And also there was this, like, vent on the back of it that had this pulsing glow that was coming from it, like it was magma or something like that. Something just slowly glowing, like, switching from glowing red to glowing orange and back again. That really frightened me. But I couldn't stop staring at it because I really wanted to figure out what it was. And my dad was just Kind of frozen in disbelief himself. And we just watched it and it kind of hovered over us for a little bit before it headed on. We couldn't hear anything. Then we saw it just kind of disappear below the tree line. So we got in and my dad didn't mention it. He didn't talk about it, he never mentioned it again. And my stepmother started to, but my dad cut her off and we just kind of drove on. I always still think about that UFO to this day. I could never tell you what it is, and I still think about it. My dad never mentioned it. My dad passed in 2016 and I kind of wish I asked him about it, if he ever figured out what it was. But I think since he couldn't explain it and figure it out, he preferred just to kind of ignore it. But I'm kind of the opposite. I kind of wanted to know more about it. There is a redux to this story. Like a part two. I was just visiting with my brother over the weekend and I was telling him about this because I never told him about this UFO story before. And he grew white when I told it to him. And he said, that's very strange that you tell this story. And I was like, why? And he's like a friend of mine, this older guy, he owned like an independently owned store down the harbor. And apparently this older guy said that he believed in UFOs. He had seen three UFOs in the same area from the time he was a child until he was an adult. And he saw it three times and it was always near the beach. Where we were was kind of near the beach. It wasn't quite on the beach, but it was near the beach and he had said that it was hexagon shaped. And that kind of, you know, it leans credence to my story. It kind of made me feel like, oh, so what I saw was maybe not that unusual after all. I'd be curious to hear if there's anybody else that had UFO sightings, especially hexagon shaped UFOs in the South Shore area of Massachusetts. I did look in Project Blue Book, the stuff that was released, and I saw reference to a UFO in my hometown where I saw this UFO in the 60s. I can't remember if I recalled it being hexagon shaped or not, but it was at the beach. And I always, when my brother mentioned that, I was wondering if that was the same one that this older gentleman shopkeeper had mentioned. Anyways, love the podcast. Have a good day.
