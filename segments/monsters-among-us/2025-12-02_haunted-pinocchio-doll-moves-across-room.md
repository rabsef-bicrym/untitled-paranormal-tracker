[Speaker C] Hey, Derek. This is JW calling from North Alabama. This happened around 1996. I was a kid at the time. Me, my family, and some family friends we had took a trip down to Monterrey, Mexico. There's street vendors, downtown marketplaces, and a lot of people that make, you know, things that are handmade where we were at. Again, I was a kid and I saw, like, a little handmade puppet very similar to Pinocchio. You can move it with, you know, strings and things like that. And I really wanted it. We got it. Well, later that night, when my family and I went back to our hotel, it was not late in the evening. And out of the blue, the lights went out in our hotel room. And when the lights went out, there was something that looked like a literal lightning bolt flash. It just kind of appeared nearly in the middle of the room. I mean, as quick as lightning. It looked like lightning. It did not look like when a light bulb blows, you know, I'm 35 now. I can look back at that memory and look at, you know, when a light bulb blows today, and I'm like, yeah, that's not what I saw when I was little. And what's crazy is, you know, when my dad, he got up out of his bed and he went to turn the bathroom light on, my doll that my family had purchased for me, the Pinocchio, like, doll, it had moved to the center of the room. That was one of the freakiest things that has ever happened in my life. You know, I know there have been tales of haunted dolls all throughout, you know, the world. You got Robert the doll, you got Annabelle the dollar. But whatever this was, you know, the power going out, the lightning bolt flash, and that doll apparently moving from my little nightstand dresser to the center of the room on its own. Like, I can't explain that, you know. Anyways, we all love your podcast, man. We love what you do. We appreciate giving us all platform stay easy.
