[Speaker C] Hey, Derek, this is Colby calling you back again. Hope you had a great, fantastic time at the Mothman Festival. Disappointment couldn't make it, but it looked like you had a blast. So I'm just strolling, you know, from. From my work across the street here to get lunch, and I was listening.

[Speaker E] To Jenny's email about the.

[Speaker C] The Chimpanzee issue from, you know, a couple podcasts ago, and, yeah, that kind of hit home. So the other story that I was gonna call you back about, I guess I can't hold out any longer. I was, like, 8 years old. Parents just got divorced. Didn't really like sleeping in my bedroom by myself. I was kind of a wiener. But basically, I'd see things in my room. I guess you would call that your typical shadow people just stuff moving across the room and whatnot. I would convince myself that it was, you know, nothing, and I would fall asleep. Except for this one time. The creature being entity, super black. I couldn't see a face, but it was moving across my bedroom from the. From the door. And it got to my bed. And then I look, you know, I kind of, like, hide my head under the covers, and I look back, and this thing is kneeling down in front of my bed and putting its hands on my bed. And I could feel my bed sinking, like, my feet sinking with, you know, the impression that was being made. And then it kind of disappeared. And then I looked back after, like, putting my head under the covers again, and as it rose back up from my feet, the best thing I can describe it as, you know, our interpretation of our western. And Jesus Christ, you know, the rock star Jesus, long hair. It was. I mean, it was Jesus from, you know, for me, growing up in the Appalachian region, all the pictures you see on the walls, it was Jesus Christ. I don't know what that is, but that's what I saw, like, poking his head up above my bed. I don't know if the creature was trying to give me an image that I wouldn't think was frightening. Turns out I'm extremely frightened of anything in my bedroom that shouldn't be there. I've kind of been a little freaked out by, you know, the images of Jesus from that point on. Not to sound sacrilegious, it's not about that. It's just literally, that's what was creeping me out of my bedroom when I was eight years old. So, yeah, that's that story. I just heard that. And it struck a light bulb, and I couldn't hold off calling any longer. Hope you like it and I'll talk to you soon, buddy. Thanks.
