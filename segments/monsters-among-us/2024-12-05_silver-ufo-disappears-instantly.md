[Speaker C] Hi, Derek and friends. My name is Colleen. I am calling from the Show Me State. I live in Independence, Missouri. I was on my way home back from work around 5:53pm on Friday, September 26th. I was wearing sunglasses and I was looking up at the sky through them. My windshield. There's no tint on my windshield. And I saw a silvery thing in the air, like flying. And I thought it might be a helicopter or some kind of airplane because there's a lot of airplanes around here. And then I took my sunglasses off to look at it again and it was still there. And then I sat back and was thinking, huh, wouldn't that be cool if it just disappeared or took off? And then I looked back up and it was gone. That was less than 2 seconds or so. And if it was a helicopter or airplane, it wouldn't have gone too far from the area. So maybe it was one of those things where the plane turned away and the sun would stop shining on it. I'm not sure, but it just happened to me. I was so excited to call, but I decided to wait and pull over. But that's my story. Thank you.
