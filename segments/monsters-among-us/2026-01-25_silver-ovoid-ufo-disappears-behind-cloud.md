[Speaker B] Hi Derek, this is Rose. I'm in Eugene, Oregon. This story is a bit of a UFO story, and it just took place about a month and a half ago or so, and I was, I was actually coming home from dropping my daughter off at her daycare, which is only about two blocks from my house. It was a clear morning with just kind of scattered clouds in the sky, but it was just a beautiful, bright Sunny Morning. About 8:30 in the morning, I'm walking home and I notice up to my left, pretty high up in the sky, an object. It was silver in color and it was oblong, kind of ovoid, didn't appear to have wings or any kind of features of a normal airplane or helicopter. It made no noise Totally silent. And it was high enough that I would imagine that if it were some kind of aircraft that is recognizable, it could be silent. It could be far enough up that it was not audible to us on the ground. But it was larger to my eyes than an airplane that would be high enough to where you couldn't hear it. So. So if it was high enough that you couldn't hear, seems like it would have been a very large object. But as you said many times, it's often difficult to measure distance on the ground. But it was silver. And the way that it moved was kind of just. It was just gliding along. But what was strange was it went behind. There was like one cloud in the sky. Like, right there in front of of me, there was one cloud. It moved behind this cloud. And as I was walking, I watched it go behind the cloud. And I kept waiting for it to kind of come out from behind the cloud. Like, I waited there, waiting to see it come on the other side of the cloud. And it just would. It just never came out. Like, it just. I walked a little further to try to see if I could see it kind of at a different angle. And I kept my eyes on that cloud as long as it took me to walk all the way home. And I never saw it come out. So this was my one experience with something that I could sort of definitively say was an unidentified flying object, as I could not identify it. I'm usually pretty good about telling the difference between an airplane or a helicopter or a satellite if it's at nighttime. That's my UFO story. Not sure what it was. I was kind of excited because it was another opportunity to call in a story. So I'm excited to hear it on the show. And I love. I love your show so much. It's my favorite. I definitely voted for it for the Paranormal Podcast Awards. So I really hope you win, and I will be hopefully reporting again soon if I have any more experiences. So thanks so much, and I'll be talking to you soon. Thanks. Bye.
