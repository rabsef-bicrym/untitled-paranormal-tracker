[Speaker D] Hi, this is Christian from Ohio, but I'm listening to an episode where somebody is talking about sleep paralysis. And I guess I've had experience with sleep paralysis, although I feel like what I experienced wasn't quite the same as what I've heard everybody else experience. But I don't know. So my experience started. I was 18, and I was working at one of the theme parks here in Ohio. And I guess I had gone to bed a little early, and I had this dream that I went to go turn off the light switch, and I could suddenly see the profile of my own face. And I told myself that this wasn't right. And then I suddenly basically lost control of my body as if a demon was trying to possess it. Then I remember trying to yell out for help or whatever, but I couldn't talk or anything. And I went out and sat on the sidewalk and called my then boyfriend to tell him, you know, about dreams. And this continued for several years, actually. I would have a dream that I was sitting and talking to somebody or, you know, just doing something normal. And then I would have this feeling of dread. And then I would say, you know, something's not right here. And then I would start losing control of my body and start screaming and maybe tongues, I don't know, or just saying, like, really nasty, mean, awful things. And then I would wake up from those. And I grew up religious, but I'm not religious now necessarily. But I realized that these dreams stopped when this would happen. I would recite the Lord's Prayer, and for some odd reason, that would stop the dream or stop the entity or whatever it was. I've had another similar dream recently where I felt an entity try to take over my body. And I started saying the Lord's Prayer and it stopped. And I watched it exit out of my room through the wall. So I don't know. I know that sleep paralysis has been explained away by lots of neurological testing and things of that nature. I have always suffered from sleep issues When I was very young, I used to sleepwalk, and that's definitely a different creepy story. But yeah, I just thought I would share my experience with the sleep paralysis. I was never awake when it happened. I was definitely asleep and unable to move. I mean, I never thought I was asleep. I always thought that I was awake when it was happening, but awake in my dream, not awake in real life, if that makes sense. And then I would basically fight for my life or yell for help, and that's it. Thanks.

[Speaker E] I.
