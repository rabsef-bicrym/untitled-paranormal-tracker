[Speaker C] Good afternoon. Derek recently found your podcast and love the format. The story I'd like to tell you about was when I was 8 years old. So it should be back in. Right around 1981. My grandparents lived in a small town in southeastern Arizona called San Simone. My granddad worked on a ranch there, and in the summertime, me and my younger sister would stay for a couple weeks during the summer to basically just hang out with my grandparents. Well, it had been a particularly hot summer, and it was just as the monsoons were starting in Arizona. One premise was me and my sister had gotten into a fight earlier that day and she had locked herself in the spare bedroom where we were sleeping. So I was stuck sleeping outside in the living room with my granddad. My granddad, Jake, was pretty much an old cowboy, and at night he would sleep with all the windows open in the single wide trailer that they stayed in. Earlier that day, I had gone fishing and had caught a bunch of small bluegill and had them in a bucket outside and had them sitting under the old swamp cooler where the water leaked into. Was early in the morning, I want to say three or four, and I heard something scramble underneath the trailer, kind of scaring me, waking me up. I was looking around. Well, I could hear something squashing around in the bucket. It was outside. And as I looked out through the open window, I saw a small figure sitting underneath of the swamp cooler frame. And it kind of freaked me out, so I dropped back down. And then as time went on, I could hear, like a chewing sound. And finally I got enough courage and I went back to the window and looked down again. And it was a small figure, like I said, bald head, wearing like an animal, fur wrapped around its waist. And it was eating the fish out of the bucket. Only reason I could see it, it was fairly clear, a few clouds, thunder and lightning off in the distance. Well, there was a shop about 100 yards away from the trailer that had a outside light. And it had just enough light to illuminate the side of where we're at. Well, as it looked up, it saw me, and then just like in a nonchalant way, put one finger to its lips and did a sh. Ing sound. Well, that freaked me out. I fell down on the ground, crawled in the corner and stayed awake until the next morning. The next morning I threw a fit to be taken back home with my sister. And that was the last time we spent a summer with my grandparents in San Simone. Love your show, love the format. I've got a bunch more stories and I will be calling in again. Thank you. Have a good day. Bye.
