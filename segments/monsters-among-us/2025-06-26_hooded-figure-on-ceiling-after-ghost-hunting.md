[Speaker C] Derek this Is Brian from Florida. Prior to 2004, I was a skeptic, But I was not so blindsided by the fact there might be something else. But I really didn't believe in anything about ghost stories. People in high school, I live in a haunted house. People tell me to live in a haunted house. When I was In Afghanistan in 2004, I got injured and I got shipped back to the states to Fort Dix, New Jersey. And most of my stories of really paranormal stuff happened in New Jersey because I met a girl that I started to date when I was stationed in the medical hold unit in Fort Dix, New Jersey. And she ghost hunted. And she said she lived in a haunted house. Now, I don't know where to start with this, because I didn't even realize how many paranormal experiences I have had until I started listening to your show. And then I realized, oh, wait, I've had more than most people I've ever talked to. But anyhow, long story short, we went ghost hunting one night in Bastow Cemetery, which is supposed to be one of the oldest cemeteries on the east coast, if not at least in New Jersey. We experienced some strange things. Orbs, disembodied, grown off the old bridge out behind by the church. And then we went home. And after that, we went to bed one night. And I looked on the ceiling and I saw this hooded figure, which I thought was just a shadow cast. She lived on a cul de sac. And the cul de sac had lights on it, and it was a subdivision. So I looked around to see what's casting this oddly weird hooded figure. And I looked at it and looked at it. And then I started realizing there's nothing in the room casting the shadow. And then I looked up and I realized it's not on the ceiling anymore. It was on the ceiling originally, and then it was down. And I sat there realizing we had brought something home. I'm convinced we had brought something home from one of our CO signs. And I don't know exactly why it was interested in me, but it was watching me. I actually shut my eyes and prayed and said, dear Lord, please let me just go to sleep. Please protect me. I don't know what this is. And I would look and it would be in the same area but in different positions. The next night, I said, I'm gonna go up there at about the same time. I'm gonna investigate this. I gotta find out what this shadow was. I went up there and there was no shadow. So I know this was a shadow person. I appreciate Your time. That's my story. Thank you.
