[Speaker D] I MAU listeners. This is Ernest from Kansas City. I wanted to tell a story about a possible ghost encounter. I was going fishing early in the morning. A buddy at work had told me about this little small rock quarry out in north Kansas City where Tiffany Springs Road. You take it all the way west until it ends and it runs into some park trails. And basically at the end of the runways of the Kansas City International Airport, you park by this gate. You have to walk an old abandoned road that's like, crumbling apart. There's parts of the road here and there you have to walk for, I don't know, maybe half a mile before you get to kind of a cattle crossing area, take a left and it takes you into some trail area and then it's still a little bit of a walk into the quarry. So it's early spring, and I'm ready to go fishing. To start off fishing season. I get there way too early. It's still kind of dark, and I'm kind of chicken to walk this trail in the dark, even though I have a headlamp. So I wait maybe 30 minutes. The sun's kind of coming up, and I take off walking down there, and I'm kind of getting the creepy vibe as I'm walking. When I was researching the place previously online by Satellite View, it pointed out that there was some old graveyards in the area. Small, like very early, possibly settlers graveyards. And I kind of had saw some entrances as I was walking down this trail. So I'm getting closer to the rock quarry area. I remember hearing, like a horse. Like the way a horse goes. There's horse trails in the area. But I immediately stop thinking I'm going to, you know, run into somebody. But nothing happens. I just shrug it off and then keep heading towards the quarry. I get into the area, It's a really small quarry. There's actually two little bodies of water. And so I go to the larger one. Right when I get to the edge, I start undoing my line. I'm a fly fisherman, so I get my line all ready to load my rod up and start casting. But I think it was right when I got to the edge and I started getting my stuff ready. Probably about 10ft out from me, there was like a big kerplunk. And it seemed like somebody had thrown something from above directly into the water. It was a couple plunk or had thrown something or shot something from a distance into the water about 10, 15ft in front of me. It was enough to make me jump back. Two seconds after that first one, two feet away from the first one, another kerplunk, and I turn around and start hightailing it up to some high land. The little entrance area that's gravel. And I stand there with all my gear and I yell out to these trees. I say, what the f. Thinking that it was like possibly a turkey hunter or deer hunter that was messing with me or something. But I don't see any movement. I'm just scanning the area. I don't see any movement. Seeing that, I just came upon the water bank. It could have been I scared some fish out and then a larger fish ate those fish or something or went after those fish and caused a splash. But I've been fishing for years and I've never witnessed a ker plunk from a fish like that. It literally seemed like somebody had thrown a rock into the water to scare me. So I go back to work and I'm telling my buddy at work, you know, about the story. I was like, yeah, that place is weird. Gave me some creepy vibes. And then this happened. And so we started talking to another guy there that was telling us that. I don't remember how many years ago it was, but it was a number of years, maybe 10 years prior that there was a plane wreck in that area because it's in the area of the airport. Three people died in the plane crash out there. And it just kind of added some validity to what I experienced. I don't know, it would just scare the out of me basically. And I just been wanting to call in and tell you. Possibly was just fish, but sure didn't seem like it at the time.

[Speaker B] Thanks, Ernest. I think it's kind of funny that you went with ghosts on this one because I'm over here researching Midwestern lake monsters. To each their own, I suppose. And I also suppose that an airliner crash in that area could warrant ghostly assumptions. And regarding that crash, here are the facts. On February 16, 1995, Air Transport International Flight 782, a ferry flight from Kansas City to Springfield, Massachusetts, Massachusetts crashed on takeoff when it overshot the Runway and exploded on impact. All three flight crew members, the only occupants on board, were killed. So Ernest is right here. There have been tragic deaths in that area and most of us tend to associate ghosts with tragic events. So the math, maths here if you will. But listen, I'm a monster guy and I want to talk about monsters. So let's for the sake of argument, say that it's not a ghost that Ernest experienced. What else might it have been? Well, there is an abundance of wildlife in that part of the country. Turtles, giant catfish, garland paddlefish, larger mammals, muskrat, otter, and a beaver will slap its tail on the water surface to alarm others and fend off would be predators. And though they haven't been found in this area per se, gators have been captured in other parts of Missouri also. Believe it or not, there's a very famous lake monster legend just around the corner. Inman Lakes sinkhole. Sam a 15 foot long worm like creature that was first spotted back in the 1920s. And believe it or not, the creature has been sighted in other bodies of water in that area. You can read all about it in tonight's show notes at Monsters Among Us podcast dot com. But is that what Ernest encountered out there in the ponds? It sure would be awesome. If he did. But you know, this is one of those rare opportunities where the explanation could be a ghost, a lake monster, or, believe it or not, Bigfoot. And that's exactly what I'm about to propose. And I do that because of a BFRO report that Delaney dug up. Now, the following encounter occurred in September of 2019, less than seven miles from the exact location Ernest heard the sounds in the water just on the other side of the Kansas City International Airport. It was around 9 or 9:30. I was taking pictures of the moon, and I tried to adjust to catch the clouds. When I made the adjustment, something in the bottom of my screen caught my attention. It was moving quickly and seemed to be grabbing things from the ground. It was too dark and it was moving too quickly for the lens to focus. In profile, it looked like a person, A very tall person with very long arms. I couldn't look away. I was afraid it would disappear. It continued its path and crossed behind a tree, and I lost it. Now, again, this encounter occurred six and a half miles from the exact spot Ernest had his experience. And all this information is available in tonight's shownotes. Now, for those that aren't making the connection, Many people have claimed that Bigfoot has the capability to throw rocks either at them or into the water near them. So that's how I see it here, Ernest. But like I said, to each their own. So whether it was a ghost, a lake monster, a known animal, or a sasquatch, I'm here for it. And thank you again for. For making the call. Now, folks, switching up gears dramatically here, please welcome Santana to the program.
