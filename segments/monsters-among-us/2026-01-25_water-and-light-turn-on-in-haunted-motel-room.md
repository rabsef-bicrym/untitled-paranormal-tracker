[Speaker C] Hey, Derek, this is Will from Connecticut. You may remember me. I submitted some art for the Mirrored Men art contest very recently. Anyways, I am currently road tripping across America, driving from Connecticut to Southern California. And I am now in a town in the middle of New Mexico, in the middle of nowhere, New Mexico called, like, Tucumcari or something. And it's, it's pretty much a ghost town. Like, there's like 4,000 people, and I guess there's a lot more people back when, like, Route 66 was a thing. But I just had my first paranormal experience last night, and I am getting the heck out of here as soon as I wrap up this call. Actually, I checked into a motel and it's nice enough. It doesn't seem very old or anything. And I conk out, like, pretty early because I was driving all day yesterday. And in the middle of the night, I heard some noise in the bathroom and the bathroom light was on and I turned all my. I know I turned all my lights off before I went to bed and I go into the bathroom and the water was running and the light was on. Here's the thing. It wasn't a normal light switch. Like, this light was, like, set. It had, like a timer dial. And that timer dial had been turned. And at this point, I had been asleep for probably four hours or so. And the maximum time limit on that thing is like 45 minutes or something, I think. And so I turned everything off. And that spooked the hell out of me. My doors were locked from the inside. So it's not like anybody just came in and did it. And for, I don't know, I feel like for the water to go on and the light to go on at the same time is really coincidental. If it's some kind of, like, faulty wiring or something got up in the Morning, I spoke with the girl at the front desk and I go, hey, you know, is this place haunted by any chance? And she just kind of gave me this, you know, silent slow nod, like, yeah, it's like it's a known thing. Anyways, Derek, I'm getting out of here. I got more driving to do. But you're the man I just wanted to share this with. You have a good one. Bye.
