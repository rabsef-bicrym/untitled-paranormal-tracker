[Speaker F] Hi Derek. My name is Eskar. I'm with denmark and I'm 19. So my story begins at midnight. I have my own little house beside my parents house. I just fell asleep. I was super close. Well, I hear my front door opening. I hear someone come in. In my mind is my mom. I'm sleeping on a loft, so I can't really see if someone's standing in my living room. She's whispering something and I can't really hear what she's saying. But after the encounter, I think she's saying something like, I think she's asleep. So I asked my mom, what? No answer. Well, I'm fully awake now. I sit up in my bed. I seen something standing on a ladder to my loft. And I think to myself, why is my mom standing on the ladder? Do you know what does that? Well, I turn on the lights beside me and see the thing is gone. The thing is, there's not a ladder where the person was standing. So that means the person, or whatever the thing was has to be at least seven foot because I'm six foot two and I can only reach the top of the wall with my fingers. So yeah, that's it. I don't know what I saw. Maybe you have a theory. I have attached a photo of my room. I have sketched the thing I saw so you can take a look for yourself. Thank you for listening and have a good night.
