[Speaker C] Hi, Derek. My name is Kelly, and I'm from Arizona. My story takes place in Tombstone, Arizona, probably, I'd say maybe about six years ago at the Birdcage Theater. So it was in December, around the time of my birthday, which is in the first part of December, and I decided to take a ghost tour of the Birdcage Theater because I figured, you know, it's been around for a while. It's got to be haunted. So, you know, the guide tells you different stories, and towards the end of the tour, they turn out all the lights, all the air conditioning. There's nothing on, no heater, no nothing. And you sit around a table. There's different equipment. And so she tells the story about where there was an act with a dog, and one of the patrons ends up shooting and killing the dog. And she says that the dog still haunts the Birdcage Theater, and she had little squeaky toys for the dog, and they weren't near me. And so I was just being funny and silly. And so I was like, here, boy, come here. Here, boy, come here. And the next thing I know, I'm bending forward. My lower back gets ice cold. And then I'm sitting down, so it's kind of like in the crook by my hip. I feel this pressure. My mom's sitting next to me, so I go to her, I go, mom, did you just touch me? And she goes, no, I didn't touch you. And so I just, you know, wrote it off as nothing. And then all of a sudden, I feel it again, and I get a little angry because I'm thinking, you know.

[Speaker B] What'S going on here?

[Speaker C] And so I go, mom, did you touch me? And she goes, no, I didn't touch you. And so I didn't think it was a ghost dog. Didn't think anything of it. So I went home and sat down, and then my dog came over to me and put his head right there in the exact same spot. And light bulb came on, and I went, oh, my God. It was the ghost dog that put its head on my lap. So that's my story. Thank you. Love the show.
