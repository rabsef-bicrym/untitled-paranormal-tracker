[Speaker E] Hi there. My name is Gary D. And I'm located up in Ontario, Canada. When I think back on some of the strange or odd experiences I've had through life, going way back to when I was just a young child, I remember when I was in middle school, I had to walk probably about two and a half or three miles to get to school, and then the same thing back. Occasionally I got a ride, but a lot of times I walked, and it wasn't bad. I didn't mind it. It's just when it was snowing or raining, it kind of sucked. But the one memory I had, which at the time was just kind of neat, unique, interesting, never really thought much of it, but later in life kind of looked back and said, yeah, that was kind of creepy. Let me explain to you what happened. When I walked back from school. I go through all these back road areas, kind of a residential area, but there was also a stretch where there was a lot of space between houses. So there'd be a house with a large yard, and then the next house down wouldn't be for maybe, I don't know, 100 yards or so. So there was a lot of space between the houses, which Was nice for the people that live there. They have some privacy. But I know there was one house in particular. I noticed one day there was a sign out front that said Hockstetter's Taxidermy. And I'd met the fellow before Mr. Hockstetter. He was a friendly guy. I'd see him out by the roadway sometimes as he pulled in, and I would talk to him and say hello. And he'd say, hello there. How are you? Young fellow and nice guy. I'm guessing at the time he was probably in his late 50s, early 60s. He lived alone. You know, I thought, what is taxidermy? I thought maybe taxi driving people around places. But I think I mentioned it to my mom or dad, and they said taxidermy means that he stuffs animals. And I said, stuffs animals like a pinata, fills it up with candy.

[Speaker C] And.

[Speaker E] No, no, no. They explained what he does is that people bring him a dead animal, and then he pulls the skin off it, lets it dry, and then he kind of puts Styrofoam or something in the middle of it and then wraps the skin around it and then paints it and puts, like, a glossy finish to make it look real again. So he did this with animals. Anything from a field mouse up to a grizzly bear or a moose. Like, he did everything as well as fish. So I thought that was kind of neat. So the one time I came back from school, I kind of snuck by that house. I noticed that his car wasn't there, so I figured, okay, he lives alone. I'm just gonna go to the back to see, because at the back of his house, he had kind of an extension with some small windows. So I snuck back there. Nobody could see me because the house was pretty far from the next one. So no one could see that I was sneaking around. So I went down the window, put my hands up against it, looked inside, and when I looked inside, I saw all of these. You know, some of the animals and fish were up on the wall on plaques or on a piece of wood. And they look beautiful. Some of them were done and painted up, and they looked like they were alive. And some of them were just the skin of the animals that was just drying and curing, I guess, before he was to paint them. And there was everything there. There were squirrels, rabbits, fox, a moose head he was working on. One thing I always remember was, like, there was a raccoon. It was kind of up on its hind legs, like it was scared of something. But any case, I thought that was kind of Neat. So kind of made it. Part of my regular routine is on the way back because I had that long walk just to take a break. I would stop in and kind of sneak around the back to look in the window. And I'd look in, kind of see what new things he was working on. And even when he was home and I noticed his car there, there were hedges and bushes, so I could sneak back there and no one could see me. And I would watch him at work. I could see him stripping the skin off of both mammals and fish, doing his work, painting, putting glass eyes and things. And what I noticed, which I thought, oh, that's nice. Because, like I say, he was probably in his early 60s. I was surprised that his parents were still alive because I could see that his mom and dad, I'm assuming that's who it was, would be sitting there watching him at work. And both of them were just sitting side by side and just, you know, sitting there, kind of leaning forward a bit, kind of watching him do his thing, probably very proud. So I went there, I would imagine, probably, I don't know, 15 or 20 times. And I started noticing that they were always there watching. And I had thought he lived alone, and I guess he didn't. Unless maybe they came by for a visit. And every time I came, they would be sitting there watching him work and never moved. Just kind of sat there, kind of leaning forward, really watching intently as to what he was doing. And, you know, sometimes they'd be sitting close to him. Other times they'd be, you know, further back, somewhere else sitting there, but they're all sitting side by side was kind of heartwarming. I thought, that's so nice. His parents took an interest in what he did. So time went on and I kept coming by and I saw him. I think he did like a. Can't remember if it was a mountain lion or was it like a large wild cat of some kind. And one time he looked up and I thought he saw me, but he kind of looked out for a while. I kind of hid behind the hedge. And anyways, I kind of sat there. And probably three or four months later, I went there and there was suddenly a For Sale sign. And I look and I go to the back. His workshop area, we did the taxidermy was totally cleaned out. There was just some cardboard on the ground, some pails, pieces of wood, some scraps on the ground, but everything was cleaned out. And I didn't see his car, you know, in his parking spot. And I was kind of walking by the one day looking and nobody was there. And I saw a neighbor out front. I think they were mowing their lawn. I said, what's with Mr. Hockstetter? You know, it seems empty. I noticed his car hasn't been there. I said, oh, no. He packed up and moved a few days ago. He's gone as he moved. They're selling the house. He says, yeah. And I said, so just him and his mom and dad left? They said, oh, no, no, just him. He said, well, no. Where is mom and dad here visiting? He said, no, his mom and dad died like 15 years ago. They both passed at the same time. They were in an accident. They both passed. So he's been living there alone all this time. And I'm thinking, wait a minute, I saw them sitting there and I saw them sitting in different places. Yeah, they were always leaning forward in the same position, never moving.

[Speaker D] Oh.

[Speaker B] Thank you, Gary. Oh, shit is right. I think we can all put two and two together here. Mr. Ostetter, whatever his name was, might have been a little too good at taxidermy. So good that he even stuffed his own parents, allegedly. And that got us thinking over here in the studio. Has any other human ever been taxidermied? Well, the answer is likely to surprise you because the answer is yes. There have been several examples from over the years, including but not limited to centuries old cases of preservation of exotic tribesmen, circus performers and an 18th century visionary. This is Jeremy Bentham, an English philosopher and social reformer who died in 1832. Before he passed away, he compiled a set of instructions regarding the disposal of his body. It was first to be dissected, then preserved and displayed accordingly. Bentham's skeleton was padded out with hay, dressed in his clothes and put on display in his favourite chair, complete with a wax replica of his head. This auto icon, as Bentham referred to it, changed hands several times before ending up in University College London's student centre. Bentham is admired for many of his principles and so his preserved remains are displayed in accordance with his wishes. He was even allowed to sit in on a council meeting once in 2013, where he was recorded as present but not voting. That clip from Fascinating horror and shows us the light hearted side of human taxidermy, if such a thing exists. But what about the darker side? I hear some of you asking, and what about more current cases of this unusual practice? Well, given that human taxidermy is essentially illegal globally, so examples are few and far between, but I did manage to find something that almost checks off all of the boxes and it occurred in Penrose, Colorado just two short years ago. The following clip is courtesy of KUSA, NBC News 9 out of Denver. Outside the Return to Nature Funeral Home, investigators put up crime scene tape and searched through a hearse. Documents obtained by 9News highlight new details on what went on inside the facility where 115 bodies were found. The Colorado Department of Regulatory agency says the owner of the funeral home claimed he practices taxidermy at the Penrose location and acknowledged that there was a problem on the property. When police executed a warrant, they found evidence that human remains were imprisoned, properly stored and the owner attempted to conceal them.
