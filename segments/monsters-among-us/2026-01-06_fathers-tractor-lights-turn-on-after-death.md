[Speaker G] Hi Derek and amongst hers. This is Jude. I'm calling from Vancouver island in British Columbia, Canada. It was recently the anniversary of my dad's death, December 10th and it's put me in mind of a strange thing that happened shortly after he died and so I thought I would call and share that story with you. The town that my dad used to live in is a really small town in Northern Ontario. There's only about a thousand people in town and there's not a whole lot to do there, especially in wintertime. So needless to say, when someone dies in town, it's kind of a community event. He was a pretty young guy when he died. He was only 56. And the way that he died was he had a massive heart attack while he was driving through town. His car actually crossed into oncoming traffic and he crashed into a snowbank in front of the local arena. So yeah, it was kind of a thing the way that he died. It was just a really strange experience for me because I was away in university in Vancouver at the time. I hadn't been home for quite a number of years. My sister had just given birth to her daughter 10 days beforehand. So it was just this really strange, bizarre experience coming home to my dad's funeral. The viewing took place off and on for two days before the funeral. And I remember it had snowed like crazy on the second day. But luckily my brother in law Mike had plowed my dad's driveway so that we could get all of the vehicles up to my dad's place. My parents are divorced and so it fell on my sister and I to kind of do most of the sort of meeting and greeting on those viewing days, you know, so those were long days for us. But I remember getting back to my dad's place the night before the funeral and his house was just cold and dark when we showed up. The fire in the wood stove had obviously gone out early in the afternoon and we were all tired. I remember watching my sister take the baby out of her car seat in the dining room and hearing her ask my brother in law Mike, hey, did you leave the lights on in the tractor? My dad's old international tractor was parked behind the house to make room for all the cars we were expecting the next day. And I remember Mike saying, what? And she said, the lights are on on the tractor. And he didn't say anything. He just turned around and went back outside. I credit my brother in law Mike for freaking us all out entirely because he's this big, no nonsense guy from Calgary. He doesn't pull any punches, he doesn't take any crap from anybody. And when he came back into the house, he was white as a sheet and completely tongue tied. And we all just kind of looked at him for a beat and then he said, I know those lights were off yesterday when I finished plowing the driveway. There's no footprints around that tractor. And he just looked expectantly at Us each in turn. And I think it was my mom who was the first one to speak. She said, well, you know, maybe there's some moisture on the wiring or something. And Mike turned and looked at her and he said, the lights are physically turned on. And he made this kind of twisting gesture with his wrist. And my sister asked him again, are you sure you turned them off yesterday? And he said, yes, because I never turned them on in the first place. He's like, I plowed the driveway during the day. I didn't turn the lights on. Besides, the battery in that thing would have been dead hours ago. It's an old battery. And we all just looked at each other and I remember hearing Mike's voice say into that cold, dark house, I think that's Wayne, my dad, trying to let us know that he's here and that he's okay. So, yeah, that's my story from my dad's death day. Thanks for letting me share it with you.
