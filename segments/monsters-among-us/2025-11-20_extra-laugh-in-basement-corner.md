[Speaker B] Hi, my name is Ankay. I live in Salt Lake City, Utah. But where this happened was in northern Chicagoland suburbs. And I grew up in a really spooky, creepy house. And there was always a lot of stuff going on. But one specific memory that I have from that house is I was about 16 years old and me and my friends were all hanging out in the basement, which is where the ghosts like to hang out and turn on water and stuff like that. But me and my friends were all just having a sleepover, having a really good time. And then all of a sudden we like laughed at a joke really hard. And then we heard another laugh in the corner of the room. And me and my best friend looked at each other and we were like, whoa, did you hear that extra laugh, like in the corner? And we're like 28 now. So this is like 12 years ago. And we still like to this day talk about it and how creepy it was and how we like knew something else was there and we ended up just like leaving all our friends down there and then sleeping upstairs. So yeah, that's my spooky story. Thanks so much. Have a great day. Bye.
