[Speaker C] Hi, Josephine here from Queensland, Australia. One of the first real ghost encounters I've had. Living currently in a duplex unit. And I haven't had anything weird happen here before. The energy has always felt quite good, quite clear. But just recently I had been noticing that there were handprints on my bathroom mirror. The first time this happened, I just, I don't know, shook it off and went, oh, I probably just leant on the mirror. But the second time this happened, I knew I hadn't leant on the mirror and I just cleaned it like a couple of days beforehand and I remembered I had not leant on the mirror. I don't do that. And I put my hand up to the handprints on the mirror and they didn't match. They were way too small. So it creeped me out and I was like, okay, I had better do something about this. So as I do, I got out my incense and I went around and cleansed the whole unit and I'm like, okay, cool, that's done. No, it wasn't. Just the other night, I came out the shower and I have an aerosol can sitting in quite a deep basket. I walk out of the room, I hear a clatter, and the aerosol can had been thrown from the basket. There was no way that it could have fallen out of the basket. Like if there was a mouse or something that flipped it out of the basket, that mouse must have been the Hercules of all mice, because I just cannot figure out how that would have happened. Since then, I've had quite a few nightmares and stuff. So things are ramping up here a little bit and I need to get more incense. Anyway, have a great night. I love your podcast. Bye.
