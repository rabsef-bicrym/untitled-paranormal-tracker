[Speaker D] Hello, my name is James. I used to work up in the oil fields in North Dakota approximately 2012, January. I'd been working there about three days. Never experienced the north. It's pretty, pretty intense to begin with. So I had to drive back to the shop, which is about three hours from our drilling location. And it's middle of the night, probably three in the morning, two in the morning, somewhere in that range. And I'm on this stretch of highway between Killdeer and Williston and I see off in the distance, maybe about a quarter mile away, something catches my eye, you know, shiny looks like eyes off in the distance. As I'm coming up, it stops, pokes his head up and looks at me. I mean the lives were just bright green. I mean it was incredible how reflective they were. I thought maybe it had been an owl because, you know, Florida, I'd seen plenty of owls. But what caught me is as soon as I was going past it, it took off running. The way it ran, very like a monkey, plain and simple. I mean, it had its ass low. It looked like a gorilla running, you know, like you would see in National Geographic. The little ass was wiggling as it was running. It was using its hands to help push it through the snow. I probably stood about 4 foot tall and it was white as could be. Didn't really get a good look at it. I didn't stop. I didn't want to mess around with it. Just kept going. And when I got back to the rig, I told my friend to about it and he immediately, that's a Bigfoot. That's a Bigfoot, gents. I don't know if it was or not. I am a believer in cryptids, but anyway, that's my story. Thanks.
