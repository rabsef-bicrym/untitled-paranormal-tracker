[Speaker C] Hi there, My name is Emily. I'm a newer listener to the podcast and wanted to share my story so I grew up in a Northern California town called Morgan Hill. My family lived in a very long ranch style home on about two acres with a smaller vineyard off of this road called Watsonville Road. The area is not necessarily the middle of nowhere, however, it's in a major agricultural area with no street lights where the homes can be really quite distanced apart. It was summer, I was home from college, so this must have been around 2012 or 2013. So I slept on one end of this long ranch home and my parents slept on the very other end. And Morgan Hill gets extremely hot during the summer, so I had the spots of my window angled slightly open to allow for some airflow. One night it was super late. I'd been up reading, probably about 1am or so. I turned off my lights and I was settling to go to sleep when something large appeared in my window. Now I never got a great look at it. However, I noticed it immediately because it contains these like pulsating blinking lights and it just hovered in my window for a period of time. The first thought that occurred to me was that it reminded me a lot of the Disneyland light show because they were like multiple pastel colors in multiple shades. But the weirdest part about this thing in the window was that it was absolutely silent. You know, I've listened to similar stories about flying objects or UFOs on this podcast where people report hearing some kind of droning noise, but there was no noise that was coming from this thing. I was frozen in absolute terror. I've never felt that scared and shocked in my entire life or since then just because I couldn't make sense of it. And I didn't really know what it was. Eventually I turned over to face away from it in bed, and I sort of willed it to go away. I had like this overwhelming sensation that while it floated in my window, it was almost trying to decide whether it wanted to take me or not. And eventually, after what felt like an eternity, but probably wasn't any longer than one minute, this thing just sort of floated away and left my window. It was many years before I ever shared this story with anyone, so I thought I'd share it here. It's been really formative in shaping my views on UFOs or any kind of mysterious stories that people share. So thanks so much and great job on the pod.
