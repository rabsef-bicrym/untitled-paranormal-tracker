[Speaker C] Hi, my name is Rebecca. I live in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. I think I'm going to share the most jarring experience I've ever had in my life. This happened about six years ago and I was with my husband at the time. He was my fiance. And we went out to eat at a local restaurant. It's a chain, the Olive Garden. It is, you know, standard American Italian cuisine. And you know, we had just had our first son who was only 2 years old. And then I was actually pregnant with our second son. And you know, we didn't get a lot of time away that first two years. So we went out to eat. We had a babysitter. I was very excited. We go to eat and about halfway through the meal I had to use the restroom. So I go in the bathroom and the way the bathroom is set up, there is a door and then you walk in and it's a long like rectangle. There's the sinks on the left and the hand dryers on the right. And then there were three stalls and they're all on the left. There is only one entrance and exit like most bathrooms. So I go in the bathroom and I am a weirdo. I check all stalls before I choose which one I'm going to use. And I looked in all three, they were all empty. I chose to go in the first stall and I knew the other two were empty because I just looked in them. I go in the bathroom, do my business, and you can see through the cracks of the stall. You can kind of see out to the rest of the bathroom. And I'm going to the bathroom and I hear the handles jiggling on one of the stalls to my left. One of the stalls that I had already seen was empty. So that struck me as odd. But I thought maybe the door was still swinging from me checking in there. So I finish up, I'm pulling my pants up and as I'm facing the door of the stall, a woman walks by. The bathroom door did not open. It did not open. And a woman walks by towards the other stall that I had just heard the jingling handles. She walks by. She had long dark hair and she was pale, very pale. I didn't hear the door open, but, you know, I. I thought that in combination with the stall door jingling, it just struck me as odd. But again, whatever. So I walk out of the stall and I look to my left. Both stalls are empty. There is nobody else in the restroom. I look in both stalls. The stall doors are open. There is nobody there. This woman walked past the stall. I could see her like she was a human, like a person. And there was nobody in the bathroom. I started freaking out. I went back out to the table, and my husband's like, oh, my gosh, you're really pale. What just happened in the bathroom? Are you okay? He thought I had morning sickness. You know, I was seven months pregnant, and I was like, I think I just saw a ghost. And I relayed the whole story to him. I went back in the bathroom. Oh, and I forgot to mention that bathroom was ridiculously cold. But a lot of bathrooms are, you know. But yeah, that was strange. I remember when I saw her walk by, all the hairs on my entire body stood up. That was another thing that just struck me as weird. Yeah. So that is the time that I think I saw a ghost. And it didn't even look like a ghost, so that was crazy. But anyway, I love your podcast. It gives me something to look forward to. So thank you, Derek. Bye.
