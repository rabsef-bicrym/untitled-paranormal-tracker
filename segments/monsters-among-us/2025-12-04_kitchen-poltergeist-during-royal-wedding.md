[Speaker E] Hi, my name is Kathy. I'm calling from Colorado. My daughter is a big fan of your show and she turned me onto it and wants me to tell my story. This happened July 29, 1981, during the wedding of Prince Charles and Princess Diana. My mother and I were in the front room watching tv. My back was facing the kitchen the where my mom was sitting. If she looked to her left, she could see the kitchen. All of a sudden it sounded like someone was in the kitchen, opening and slamming the cupboard doors and the drawers and throwing silverware all over the place.

[Speaker C] And very loud, very scary.

[Speaker E] I looked at my mom and she turned her head and looked into the kitchen for about two or three seconds. Then she looked back at me and her eyes were like really big. And she shook her head no, as if to say, don't turn around. Just sit there and wait. So about 20, 25 seconds later, it stopped. We then both got up, went into the kitchen. There was silverware everywhere on the floor, on the counters. The cupboard doors were still open, the drawers were still open. And we were just looking at each other like, what the heck happened? So we just cleaned up the kitchen and went back down and sat down and watched TV as if nothing happened. We never talked about it after that. I'm from California, born and raised, 43 years. I know what an earthquake feels like. It definitely was not an earthquake. I have researched earthquakes on July 29, 1981, in or around the Bay Area and could not find anything. So to this day we don't know what it was, but it was very, very scary. And she never did tell me what she saw that day that she looked into the kitchen. So I don't know what she saw. And well, thank you for letting me share my story. Have a good one.
