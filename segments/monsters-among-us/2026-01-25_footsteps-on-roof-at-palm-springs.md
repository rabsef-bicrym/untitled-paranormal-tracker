[Speaker B] How you doing, Derek? My name is Carter. I'm from Salt Lake City, but my story takes place actually in Palm Springs, California. I must have been probably about 12 years old. Me and my two brothers were really into Dance Dance Revolution at the time on the Xbox, but we were at a family reunion, so I'm pretty sure during the summer. I recall it being really hot and sunny, but maybe that's how it always is there. I'm not sure. We were staying in this really nice one story, but a really expansive house. And I can't remember exactly, but I'm pretty sure somebody famous lived there before. I have to ask and see if my family knows about that and maybe get some more specifics about that. But basically we were staying there for a week, and my first experience at the house that really made me, I don't know, think that something was off. Basically our parents were outside, it was kind of late, and they were all, you know, having a few drinks with their relatives. So pretty much all the adults were outside, and me and my two brothers, I think, were the only ones. We were right inside. There's just a sliding glass door that goes right out to a huge patio area with a big pool. Yeah, we were right inside the sliding glass door and I knew that everyone was outside. Pretty much everyone was outside, you know, having a good time or hanging out in the pool drinking. We were just playing Dance Dance Revolution. And I just remember hearing something that I've heard a lot actually on your show, which I think is weird. Just the heel to toe walking, you know, on the roof, on the ceiling. You can just tell it's above you and you can just tell that somebody's walking, which I thought was weird because this is a one story house, like I said earlier. So I didn't immediately draw a conclusion that it was something super out of the ordinary. First thing coming to my head, I was like, who's on the roof? Like, why? You know, I thought maybe someone was, you know, getting a little too tipsy thinking about me jumping off into the pool. Because, yeah, like, the roof must have been fairly close to the pool. The pool was, you know, just right outside the house. So that was my first thought when I walked outside. You know, I felt like I wanted to go out and see what's happening. So I walk outside and I remember seeing my mom pretty much immediately when I walk out and I asked her, you know, who's on the roof? And sure enough, no one was on the roof, which I thought was weird because I distinctly heard walking on the ceiling, on the roof, like right above us while we were playing Dance Dance Revolution. And that was my first experience in the house. And from that point on, for the rest of the trip, I was very off put and I had a weird feeling in the house. And I think there's one other occasion where I heard dishes rattling during the middle of the night and I went to check and no one was in the kitchen. But other than that, that was just the only really discernible, weird, at least ghost experience that I've ever had. Yeah, I still remember to this day, and still no explanation. But I've heard a lot of those accounts on your show where individuals will hear that heel and toe walking, you know, And I've heard it on countless paranormal TV shows and all of that. So I just think it's a weird coincidence and want to know what you think. All right, thanks, Derek. I love the show. Gets me through my hard days at work. So appreciate it and we'll keep listening. Have a good one.

[Speaker A] Thanks, Carter. It is always hot and it's always sunny in Palm Springs. It's an amazing place. And it's practically one of the corners of our Borrego Triangle. Certainly a strange and beautiful location. And luckily for us, we do not have to guess whose house they were staying in because Carter called back with further information.

[Speaker B] I was Just calling back with a few more details about my story. Got in contact with my mother about who had previously lived in the house, and apparently it was a relative of the Kennedy family. Not exactly sure. Like, that's all she could give me on that. I could do a little more digging and potentially figure out, like, the exact address of the house. And I will try to do that. But one thing my mom brought up that could be a possible explanation was like, a maintenance man, which I don't think could be because, like I said, the roof was like, one story is really low. It was nighttime, and, like, they didn't call any maintenance people. So I think it would be weird if the maintenance person would show up that late, if there wasn't some kind of emergency or something like that. On top of all that, I walked outside, like, right after I heard the sound, and I looked up on the roof, and I could see whoever it was, like, crouched or laid down on the roof as soon as I walked outside or something. Plus, all the adults were outside, you know, drinking, like I said. And it would be weird to me if none of them had seen this maintenance person, you know, on this one story roof right next to them. Because when I came out and talked about it, everyone was just like, I don't know what you're talking about. No one's on the roof. You know, so just a thought my mom had. Like I said, it was clear as day, heel to toe, like heavy boot walking. And I've heard that a lot.
