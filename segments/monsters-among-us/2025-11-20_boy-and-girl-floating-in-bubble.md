[Speaker C] Hey, Derek. This is a story from my mom's childhood. She and her four sisters grew up in the deep south in an old sort of cabin like house. So my mom and her four sisters were playing around in their yard. They lived in sort of a forested area back in the boonies, I guess. And all of a sudden out of the sky comes a boy and a girl. And what they described in a bubble floated down to maybe a little bit above their heads and started striking up.

[Speaker B] A conversation with them.

[Speaker C] I don't think they really Remembered a lot of what the boy and the girl in the bubble said. It seems like it was just normal conversation, like, how's the weather, what are you guys doing, how old are you? All kinds of different things like that. Just, you know, like kids would normally talk about.

[Speaker B] And after a while they said something.

[Speaker C] Along the lines of, well, we need to go now. Be on the lookout for us in the next big snow. And then they floated away. I believe in the deep south, if you're familiar with any kind of weather patterns, big snows are not very common. However, my mom did point out that there was a big snow, I think that following year, not too long after. But they happened to be away at the time, and they weren't able to go back and see if the boy and the girl in the bubble ever came.

[Speaker B] So the sisters really thought that this.

[Speaker C] Was just a figment of their imagination, you know, and for years didn't really speak about it.

[Speaker B] But decades later, after they came together.

[Speaker C] To visit and talk about ghost stories and different stories from their childhood, one of them mentioned the boy and the girl in the bubble. And they were all so surprised because they thought it was just a signal of their imagination. And they talked about it and all the facts seemed to line up with what each one experienced. So it actually happened.

[Speaker B] So I'm curious to see if any other viewers had any other experience about.

[Speaker C] A floating boy and a girl in a bubble. It's a very curious phenomenon, but I'm sure I'll call back later with some more stories about my mom's childhood if I can get some more permission from her, I suppose. But hope you have a good rest of your day and to the viewers out there, have a wonderful rest of the year.
