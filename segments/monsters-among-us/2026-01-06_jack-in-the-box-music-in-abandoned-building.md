[Speaker D] Hi, Derek, my name is Cody. I am originally from the uk, but I've moved over to Sweden. I'm here to tell you my story about what happened when I was back in the uk. So this is going back quite many years now. Maybe when I was about 14, 15 years old, I was out with some friends. And this is in a area called Buckinghamshire and we were visiting this old abandoned. It's a GE health center. The best way to describe it, like a small house really. And it was down a small, really long back road and it was at the end of the back road. There was no houses around it. There was just lots of fields and a bit of a wooded area surrounding it. And this place has been abandoned for quite a while. I've been there previously with friends. A little bit boring. There's nothing in there kind of, you know, people have been there and they've wrecked it and whatnot. But this time I went with two of my friends and it was completely boarded up. People obviously knew that, you know, everyone's been inside of fish. They've put big steel kind of casings all around the windows and the doorway. So we were searching for about half an hour for a way to go in there and have a look about. But there was no way of getting in here, Derek. It was just completely sealed off. Every single entrance you can imagine is just sealed off. One of our friends had a phone call, so he decided to walk off away from the house. And to get where the house is, there's a little wooden gate. So you climb over the small wooden gate and then you walk for maybe about a minute until you get to the house. And it's all overgrown around the house, but you can clearly walk around it. So he's walked away and he's behind some trees. It's quite far away to the distance where, you know, we can't hear him on the phone and whatever. So it was just me and my one other friend, you know, we still kind of wanted to get in, have a look about. So we were still somewhat looking around. So we went to the back side of the house again. So this is even further away from where the entrance to the house is. And even further away from our friend. So we have the whole house, you know, a blocking where our friend is. We have a walkway and trees there as well. So there's almost no way that we'd be able to hear our friend unless he kind of shouts at the top of his lungs or anything like that. And then all of a sudden, me and my friend, we hear, like, a jack in the box. If you don't know the tune, you can obviously have a look, but go something like. And it'll keep doing that until obviously, the jack in the box jumps out. And me and my friend, we heard this sound faintly coming from inside of the building, inside of the house. And, I mean, I'm getting chills now speaking about it, because it's just almost unexplainable. I mean, I'd love to hear what you have to say about it, but this tune was so faint, and you could hear it almost directly coming from inside of the building. And as I said, if this was our friend that was playing it, you know, he must have been either inside the building, which he wasn't, or he must have been so close for us to hear it. But maybe after about five seconds of hearing this, me and my friend looked at each other, and our faces both dropped. And I think we both knew, like, this is not right. So we didn't actually say a word to each other. After we looked at each other, we sprinted past the house. We threw ourselves over this gate, and to our surprise, we saw our friend there, still on the phone, and he's, like, super shocked because we've just come sprinting over the gate and towards him. And he's like, what are you guys doing? And we're like, well, you're not just messing about with us. He's like, I'm on the phone. I've been on the phone. And, you know, he wouldn't have had the chance to have played this tune and then run away and, you know, got to the position where he was and, you know, maybe not being out of breath or anything like that, you know, it was almost, you know, impossible for him to have done this and made this sound come from inside the building and then run away to the position he was in. He was, like, super shocked and saying, oh, you know, I don't get it. What did you guys hear? So we found a YouTube video, and.

[Speaker A] Me and my friend were like, yeah, yeah, that's the one.

[Speaker C] That's the one.

[Speaker D] Oh, my God. And, like, we were going crazy at the fact that we heard this so faint, but yet so clear coming from inside this building that was so, so secure. And then we kind of all got a bit freaked out after that and decided to make a walk away from the building and back to where kind of the main roads were and more houses and civilization. It's super, super strange. I think about it a lot. But yeah, absolutely love your podcast. You and all your team are absolutely amazing. Please keep on doing what you guys are doing. You make so many people happy. Thank you. Bye bye.
