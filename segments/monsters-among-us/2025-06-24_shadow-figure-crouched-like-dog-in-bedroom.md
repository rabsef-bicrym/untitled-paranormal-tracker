[Speaker D] Hey Derek, this is Jessica from Ohio. I'm about 30 minutes north of Columbus, out in the country and I live in the woods. I'm on 75 acres. We're surrounded by woods. My house is pushed back off the road. We've been having some activity in the house recently to the point where my guy will wake up and he's bruised and he's swollen in spots. One time he actually broke his foot. Well, this morning at about 3am he said he woke up and he told our dog, lay down buddy because the dog sleeps in bed with us. Our dog is about a 70 pound black pit bull. We also have two black cats that live with us also sleep in the bed. I was just waking up at this point too. I know that my dog was not up because he sleeps right up against me. I can feel him at all times. He has to constantly be touching me. So I felt him and I knew that he wasn't up. Fast forward to about 8am I'm making breakfast. I sat down with him to talk about like, hey, were you sleep talking? And he says, no, I kind of leaned up and I looked and our room is black, ceiling's black, and I have blackout curtains from a corrections officer, so I like to get some sleep. And he said, no. He leaned up and he saw what he thought was our pit bull with ears pointed straight up. And when he said, lay down, buddy, he kind of looked harder and kind of squinted. And he said he rubbed his eyes and then he noticed the thing was gone. Well, he said he just kind of freaked out, rolled back over and went back to sleep. And again, I didn't know about this thing at the foot of the bed on my side until we had talked about it at 8am there's been other activity in this house to the point where doors have come swinging open. I've been in the shower and our bathroom sink has come completely on. And it was just me and my guy in the house at the time. I've always had activity around me. The house I grew up in came off of Hoover Reservoir before Hoover was put in. It was placed up on top of the hill. Lots of activity in that house. Again, it's always had activity around me. I do believe whatever it is is attached to me since it's happened my entire life and usually the activity doesn't happen unless I'm in the house. Kind of spooky, but love your show. Keep it up. Can't wait to listen.
