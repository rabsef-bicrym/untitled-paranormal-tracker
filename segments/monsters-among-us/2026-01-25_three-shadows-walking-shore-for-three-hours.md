[Speaker B] One night we were coming home from family get together. I'd say it was probably around 10 o' clock at night. Decided to drive to the beach because a family friend was there. So my dad parked the car on the on the sand and my mom And I stayed in the vehicle. We stayed in the truck. My dad said he wouldn't take any more than. I don't know, like, 10 minutes. So my mom and I were just sitting there. We turned the truck off because we didn't want to waste gas. So I just recall we were sitting in there, just relaxing, waiting on my dad. Eventually, my mom fell asleep. So we got to the beach at 10. I'd say my mom fell asleep probably around 10 minutes after we got there. So I'd say 10, 10. All I can recall is I was watching the shore. The moon was a very vibrant light just casting over the shoreline. The way the waves crash against the shore. Hypnotic. It's mesmerizing. The way the moonlight just bounces off. Radiant water. Just creates this shine, this glow. It's very, very distinct. You can see everything that happens on the water. Every single wave, every single ripple. You can see it all. I think that's what makes this memory so vivid. I recall there was a light from. I want to say it was probably a public works building. I was watching the shore. My mom was asleep. She dozed off, and she laid across the bench. I just remember sitting right in front of her, in between her legs, you know, Small kid. And we were able to get comfortable in our small little truck. I saw these shadows. They looked like shadows walking up the shoreline. I want to say there were three of them, about three distinct shadows, just walking. The shadows were casted on the shore, and the shadows were up against the water as well. So these were some long shadows. I didn't see what was casting in the shadows. There were coconut trees in the way, but I could see the little. Little public works building. I could see the light, but I couldn't see the portion of the shore where someone would be standing if their shadow was canned. All I know is we were there. We were parked. My mom was asleep, and it was 1010 because that's when she fell asleep. My dad said he'd be back in 10 minutes. And I'm watching these shadows, and it almost felt like a mirage. It almost felt like a dream. It was so weird. But the reason I knew it wasn't a dream was because I was watching the water. I was watching the shore. And I was watching these shadows move. And I was in an upright position. And I recall sweating. I just had this sense of anxiety, like I couldn't take my eyes off these shadows. I had to watch them. I had to make sure they didn't leave. I had to make sure they didn't just disappear and vanish. They were just there, just dancing, all three of them. It looked like three people walking towards you, like their shadows were walking towards you, all making the same movement. Arms, legs, looked almost like military marching. But I didn't see the people casting them. But the thing that scares me about thinking it my theory why I took so long to recall this. I think of this memory every now and then, but I think of it for a second and I stopped because it was just so weird and it was so long ago. But I recall my dad opening the driver's side door and I looked at him and then I looked at the clock and he goes, sorry it took so long, but we can go now, the party's over. And the clock says it was about 1am So I was watching three shadows do the exact same thing marching towards me on the shore when nobody appeared for three whole hours. It was one o'. Clock, my mom was dead asleep. My dad opened the door and it went from 10, 10 to 1 o'. Clock. How does that happen? The background of the memory is the beautiful radiance of the moonlight bouncing off the waves on the shore. The way the ocean just sat there, calm and peaceful with these shadows bouncing off the water, with these shadows being projected onto the sand and shore and how vivid it all was and how the memory seemed like it was so short. But the reality of the moment was it took three hours for my brain to record all that when it felt like I was only looking at the shadows for no longer than maybe a few minutes. What felt like a few minutes translated into three hours? I don't know. Well, Derek, I hope you have a good time with your podcast. And I'm always listening. I'm always listening to your podcast. Thank you.
