[Speaker C] Hey, Derek. This is David in Wilson Brook, Texas. When I was a little boy, we used to go up to Oklahoma, visit my half brother and my half sister and all that. And one night we're over there going to like a fairground. It's like in winter of, I would say 80 or 81, five or six years old, very young. But this is such a vivid memory. And we're walking across the field. Yes. At night to a severe ground. You can see all their Ferris wheels, all that stuff. And as I'm walking with my family across the field, after we get out of the truck, I looked to the left and into the sky because something got my notice. There was a giant, for lack of a better word, it was a giant egg. It was like an egg shaped craft just hovering there. It was very luminous. It didn't have lights around it, but it looked like more like the lights were coming from within it. But there's no windows, no windows at all. Just an egg. A damn egg. It wasn't the moon and it was no blimp, no, nothing like that. I remember looking at the thing and what's weird is that I remember looking at it, but I don't remember looking away from it to continue walking with my family. Because one second I'm looking at it, next second I'm still welcoming my family to the fairgrounds and there's like a little blank space of time right in between me looking at it and that the memory didn't come back to me until like a few days later. And all of the memory just flashed back to me like. And even at that young age I remember, oh my God, what did I see, you know, that night? And the memory still stuck with me. But I, for life of me, for life of me, can I remember what happened in that gap when I looked at it? And then I continued to walk with my family, you know, to the fairground. I had no memory of the missing space. And I asked my mom, my dad and all that if they had seen it, you know, over the years. I asked them periodically and no, my ancestry didn't see it either. And so it was just one of those weird occurrences that as I got older I started studying more about UFOs. I found out that it's called a missing time effect. And what I had, I don't know. Even the egg shaped craft back then I thought I was the only one that seen something like that, but it's actually quite common, especially nowadays. I hear a lot of sightings of HC craft. There's even a CNA who works at Exploration My Mat, when she was 16, she saw an AC craft out in the country here in Texas. And it looked the same thing. That might look like it was a luminous egg shaped craft, but she didn't have the mission time effect that I did. But yeah, you do a great job. Great, great, awesome job. I love the podcast. Goodbye.
