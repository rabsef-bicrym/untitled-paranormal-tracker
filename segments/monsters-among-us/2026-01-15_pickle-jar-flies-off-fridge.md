[Speaker C] Hi, this is Alicia and I'm from the Dallas area.

[Speaker D] This one is like short and sweet. I was living in a house close.

[Speaker C] To the Houston area and there was a bunch of energy there that was.

[Speaker D] Unexplainable just because I experienced most of.

[Speaker C] The things in my life from there first time. I had sleep paralysis, reoccurring dreams, things of that sort. But anyway I was getting ready for work or something and I was standing in front of my vanity and doing my makeup and I had this pickle jar full of change, just that you accumulate over time. So it was like a big pickle jar, and it was sitting on my mini fridge on the ground, and the pickle jar was towards the back of the fridge. Anyway, I'm just listening to music, getting ready, and it just goes flying off of my fridge and falls on the floor. And there's no way it could have fallen. It wasn't unstable and it wasn't on the edge, and there's nobody else in the room and nothing going on. And it didn't break was the other thing. It fell on carpet. And I didn't feel afraid or scared or, like, creeped out. I was just like, how in the world did that happen? So I just kind of said out.

[Speaker D] Loud, okay, that's not funny. That could have been bad.

[Speaker C] Do not do that again. I was very deliberate with my words. Not that I think it would help any, but it was worth a try. Anyway.

[Speaker E] I love the show.

[Speaker C] Keep doing what you're doing. Thanks.
