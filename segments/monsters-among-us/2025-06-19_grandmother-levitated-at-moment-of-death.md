[Speaker D] Hi, this is Tara calling from Brentwood, California. I am 52 years old, gonna be 53 next month. I have a lot of stories I'd like to tell you, but I think first I'm going to tell you something that I have not ever heard anybody mention before. This has to do with my grandmother who passed away in 1963. And this was told to me by my aunt, who has also passed away. But she told my mother that when my grandmother was dying in her hospital bed, she was taking her last breath. And this is never talked about in my family, although we do talk about spooky things a lot. When she was taking her last breath, my aunt said my grandma let out a horrific kind of like a growl, something that you'd hear of, like a possessed person. And as she was doing that, she was taking her last breath. My aunt said my grandma rose, her whole body levitated about a foot off her bed. And my aunt said she screamed and she saw her levitate and gently float back down to the bed. This is never talked about because it is so bizarre. I was just wondering if anybody out there has had anything like this happen to them or if anybody knows of any stories out there that this has happened to somebody you know. Thanks, Tarek. This is a great show and keep it spooky. Bye.

[Speaker C] Bye.
