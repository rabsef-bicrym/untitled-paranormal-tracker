[Speaker E] Hey, Derek. It's Peter from Tennessee. So I had a weird thing happen to me while running at night. I often run around midnight, and then I'll go to bed. For some reason, it helps me sleep. But this one night, I was running and I ran up a cul de sac and ran back down. And my neighborhood has uniform mailboxes. They're all brick and they all have a light pole in them. For some reason, I'm fixated on this light pole to my left, this mailbox to my left. And as I'm looking at it, smoke emanates from it. And my first thought is a fuse blew out or something. And as the smoke rises, it takes the form of a miniature body. Now, this body didn't have arms or torso, just legs, like something that's about a foot tall, walking in the air from right to left, right in front of my path, and then disappeared. It was one of the weirdest things I've seen. I've seen some paranormal things in my time, but I've never heard of some really small, almost like a child, and walking like a man, upright in air and then disappearing. Hope you like it. Love the show. Toodles.
