[Speaker B] Hello, this is Nicole. I'm calling in from Ohio. And this story took place actually in Columbus. My friend and I, we were listening to the show on a trip somewhere. We were listening to an episode and they were talking about big cats or black cats that people had seen. And she reminded me of something that she saw when we were teenagers. So this took place in the far south end of Columbus. To me, that means south of 104. My best friend grew up in a neighborhood down there off Parsons Avenue, down near Great Southern Shopping Center. Now, this was In, I believe, 1986. I was at her house one day and we were sitting on the front porch and she said, I got to tell you about something I saw a couple days ago. And she pointed at a spot and it's maybe 80, 100ft away from us. And she said, yeah, right over there. She said, in between that person's house and mine, I saw this big black panther walk from between the houses. It turned, it looked at me, knowing that I was watching it. And then it just did what normal cats do, big or small. And it just slunk right across the street and went between the other two houses and it was gone. And I said, are you sure it wasn't just a big, huge black cat? You Know, and she said, yeah, because her parents and I remember them, they had had these two large. I believe they're called Norwegian Forest cats or something to that effect when we were younger kids. And they are very, very huge house cats, legal to own. And she's like, they were much bigger than those two. And I said, all right. And I believe her in the sense. Because I mean, well, one, she's my best friend, and two, I've been in people's houses there in that neighborhood, and there were people there that had some pretty freaking negative exotic animals. And she said it was definitely a panther. It was not a kitty cat. It wasn't a house cat. It was a panther. It was big. She said you could kind of see spots underneath the darkness, the blackness of the fur, which I believe it's a black jaguar, but I'm not for certain on that. But, yeah, those people in that neighborhood, there was some pretty exotic animals, pets I've seen that those people had back when we were younger. So I completely believe that it was a big black panther. They'd gotten out of somebody else's house and never saw it in the news. So I'm assuming it made it back home and didn't attack anybody's outside pet. So there's your big true black cat story from the 1980s. Alvin to Columbus. Thanks a lot. Bye. Bye.
