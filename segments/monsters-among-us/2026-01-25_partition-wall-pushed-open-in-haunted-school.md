[Speaker B] Hello, my name is Jennifer and I'm calling from Smith meeting Pennsylvania. I have several ghost stories and this is one that's just a small quick one that just like came into my head when I was listening to something else and I was like, oh, yeah, this one. So I wanted to record it so that I wouldn't forget. I'm a teacher and I've been teaching for 25 years. But my very first year was 1993 and I was in a school. The building was definitely around in the 20s. I remember seeing pictures. They would have pictures of every year the staff would like there'd be a picture. So I remember seeing pictures of staff, staff from the 1920s. So I'm not sure exactly when, but that must be when the building was built. So it was a really old building and I had. I'm a phys ed teacher and I also have to teach health. So I had my own health room upstairs on the third floor and this and like where my desk was, behind my desk was a wall that was like a partition wall that you could like open up and make the room bigger so it's attached to like another room behind me. And it was pretty solid door though. Like you, you could hear the other class like a little bit, but it was made of wood. Like this is really old building. So everything was made of like really good material so you could open it. What we never did, we kept the two rooms separate. So one day I was on a break. So then like my lunch for my prep or something and the girl that was behind me, she was young like me. We were both like in our 20s and she taught a sixth grade class and she took them to lunch and then she would go in her room and she would eat in her room. And you know, we would occasionally go over to each other's room or talk or whatever, like when the kids weren't there. So I was sitting with my back towards this partition and these partitions were like really heavy and we never opened them. If we were going to talk to each other, we walked out into the hall and went around. We never opened them or touched these walls. We always left them locked. I didn't even really know how to do it. So I was sitting with my back, you know, where the partition was. And then all of a sudden it like got pushed in. So like the point of it came into my room, like as if she was opening it, like pushing it to come in. And she's never ever done this. And this was I guess like February ish or something. We were like pretty well into the school year and it startled me and I started talking to her as I really thought it was her. And I'm like, oh, you know, what are you doing? I don't even remember what I was saying like 25 years ago. But she didn't answer me. So then I got up and I like went and I like looked in her room and nobody was there. And it wasn't just open a little bit, it was open a lot that I could just walk right over. So I think like, if it was to like release itself, which it never did in all these months that I was there, I never seen it open. I would think it would only do it like a little bit. I mean, I guess, I don't know. I didn't like test it and shut it and see what happened. I just like was kind of freaked. I think I got my stuff and I like left. So a couple like days later, whatever, a month or whatever, same school year, I remember I was talking to one of the general cleaners and I, I think I told her what happened, how like the door got pushed in and I got freaked out and all this. And she said oh, she's like, well, you know this school is haunted, right? And I'm thinking like what? No, like no one's ever talking about that. You know, we're talking about like whatever we're doing with school. And she proceeded to tell me that around the corner was the seventh grade. And she said that one time she was cleaning in there and she turned around and there was a man standing in the back of the room. And she said he was all like an old time clothing, but she just thought it was like a person, like a parent came in or something. And she started like talking to him and everything and she walked towards him and then he disappeared. So I don't, you know, I don't know if she was just telling me a story or not because of what I said, but you know, that was her story. And this thing with the door did happen to me and never, it never happened again. I was there for two years. That was the only time it ever happened. So I just wanted to, you know, record this. And you know, sometimes I forget about things that happened me and then I hear a story and it like jogs my memory. So I just wanted to make sure that I had it recorded and I didn't forget. Okay, bye.
