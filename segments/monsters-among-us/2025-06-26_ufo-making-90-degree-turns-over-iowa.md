[Speaker C] Hi, my name is Zach, I live in Butte County, Iowa. It was like 2008, I think I was sophomore in college that summer before my sophomore year. And I think it's that because right around that time there was really, really bad flooding in eastern Iowa in like Cedar Rapids, Iowa. And it was one summer night, I was in northern Dubuque county near Cheryl or Bald Town, Iowa, and I was at a friend's farm bonfire, hanging out. And I walked a little ways away from the bonfire to go to the bathroom real quick. And I looked up into the sky, which would be over the Mississippi river, and I saw what I thought was the International Space Station. So I was really excited to see that. And I was watching it and it stopped making the trajectory path that it normally would. So I knew it wasn't the ISS. And it started to make 90 degree right angle turns and it was just like the size of like a star. Couldn't tell anything else with it, but it shot up, it shot over to the left, shot over to the right, it would stop, it would shoot over in another direction, it would stop. And then I think I shouted for my friends to see if they could see it. And I'm pretty sure that they did. This is of course before we all had smartphones, so I'm pretty sure they saw it. It disappeared. It really freaked me out, freaked them out. And then it reappeared like 30 seconds later in a totally different spot. It started to make very sharp turns in many directions and then it disappeared again after like a minute. We were all really excited. I didn't know if it was something to do with the floods for some reason in Iowa. I didn't know if it was helicopter, some sort of surveillance thing for the flooding, but I don't think it is anymore. And I've reported this to mufon and I'm pretty sure that was last year. I don't think it was this year that I reported it. I don't know if they ever did anything with it.

[Speaker E] I talked to somebody about it and.

[Speaker C] They took my information. This was pretty late at night. I'm thinking I left their house at like midnight 1am but I could be wrong. But when I was coming back like a 20 mile ride back home, I called the local police department to see if anybody else had reported anything. They said no, of course they probably thought I was crazy. And you know, this was before the government confirmed they have sightings that they can't explain, but I'm sure they don't have any recording of me calling. I just know it's probably the summer of 2008, but it was definitely something that I can't explain and I tried to be very logical. So I'm going to call it a UAP ufo. I think MUFON did too. And stuff does happen over eastern Iowa, along the Mississippi and Dubuque County. I appreciate your podcast. It's something I listen to very often and I hope to maybe call back someday with some other stories.
