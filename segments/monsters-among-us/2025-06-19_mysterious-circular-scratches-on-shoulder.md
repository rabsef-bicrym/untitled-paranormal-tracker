[Speaker C] Hi, Derek. My name is Montana. I've been listening to the show since the very beginning, but I've never called in. But I have a lot of stories. So the first one I wanted to share was I was in College at CU Boulder. It was evening, probably February 2016, and I was just sitting in my bed. And I'm a pretty clean person. So there's nothing in the bed, there's nothing on the floor that I could have maybe stepped on or brought into the bed. And that's relevant for a later point. But I was, like, drawing something, sketching with a pencil, then a paper on a hard surface. I think it was my accounting textbook. And kind of leaned over ever so slightly. And all of a sudden, I feel this, like, excruciating pain, almost like a bee sting or a spider bite. But in the moment of it happening. And I didn't freak out at first because, like, oh, it's some weird bug. I mean, I freaked out a little bit, but not a ton. And it was perfectly in the middle of my shoulder blade. And I thought that was kind of funny because, I don't know, I feel like I would have noticed that. And I didn't have a big jacket or anything on, just a soft T shirt. But the weird part was it just hurt more and more and started to kind of burn. So I took my cell phone and took a picture of it so I could see what it looked like. It was, like, perfectly in the middle, so I couldn't see it all. And it was about the size of a nickel in a perfect circle. With just a bunch of the thinnest tiny scratches. Like if I had sat there with a needle and somehow like, I don't know, cut out a stencil and just perfectly did these long lines of through the diameter to just make it like a red circle full of tiny scratches. It was the weirdest thing I have ever experienced in my whole life and very creepy. So if anyone else has ever had that happen, I'd love to hear about it. And keep up the good work, Derek. I listen to you all the time and it's my favorite way to get through traffic in la. Bye.
