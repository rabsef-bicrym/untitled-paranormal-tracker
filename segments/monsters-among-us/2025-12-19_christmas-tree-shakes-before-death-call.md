[Speaker A] Hi, this is Melissa. I'm originally from St. John's Newfoundland in Canada and I currently live in upstate New York. I'm gonna tell you a story that happened to my grandma. We grew up very superstitious. We believe in omens, those type of things. I mean we believe in the paranormal messages from the other side. My family is very open to it off. We've had a few incidents where my mom and my grandma believe that they've had omens from the other side. But there's one story in particular that has been passed down from a couple generations from my grandma. I mean if you ask anybody in my family, they know this story and they're kind of freaked out by it. It kind of confirms my belief in omens. So I'll take you back to the 70s when my grand grandma just had my mom and my aunt. They were probably one and not even one years old. They were in like a playpen upstairs. It was a couple days or a couple weeks before Christmas and my grandmother was in the kitchen cooking and she heard something happening to the Christmas tree. The Christmas tree was shaking. She went out to look because she figured maybe my mom or someone got out of the playpen because they were starting to stand, climb, you know, all those things. But she looked and you know the kids were still in the playpen. She went back in the kitchen to tend to like dinner or whatever. She heard a window open and she went and looked and she thought it was my grandfather coming home from work or whatever, no one there. She closed the window. She was like, that's just really, really weird. She went back out into the kitchen. The next time she went out, she heard the tree shake, shake, shake really really loud. And if you know what those old Christmas ornaments sound like, they're all glass so they're not like that little plasticky ting sound like you can Hear them clinking together, very, very loud. She said you couldn't miss it. It was the trees shaking. You know, she went out and looked at the tree and it was still moving. So she knew that, you know, something was shaking it. She looked everywhere for my mom and my aunt. They are still in the playpen. So when she comes back down over the stairs, I don't know if you guys remember the old tinsel that you would lay on top of the tree, like the little silver strands. She said every single one of them were standing up on top of the tree. She said she couldn't believe it. She had goosebumps. She started freaking out. And then the next thing you know, before she could do anything, the tree tipped over completely. As soon as the tree tipped over completely, she got a phone call. She ran right to the phone, of course, like, oh, my gosh, help me. Like, what is happening in my house right now? She said she ran right to the phone. When she answered the phone, my great grandmother, who was having surgery that day, a very minor procedure had passed away on the table. And she thinks that it was her way of letting her know, you know, I'm here, but something bad is going to happen. And you're the person who needs to tell your husband that his mother just passed away. So she thinks that it was an omen from the other side. So that's kind of a story that really freaks me out. I know it was a good omen. It was probably from my great grandmother. But still, when things like that happen, when you're alone and it's unexplained at the time, it's probably a really big scare. But that's my story on omens. And thanks so much for listening.
