[Speaker C] Hello, Derek, this is Giles from Nevada, Missouri. Small little town up there south of Kansas City. When I was in second grade, maybe six, seven and around there, I remember specifically, like, having a dream where I was on a cruise ship and it basically sunk sideways close enough to an island where it was, you know, half in the water, half out of the water. And I was living with my mother and my stepfather at the time. And I remember maybe a day or two later Waking up and going into the living room and seeing they had news on. And on the news, they were reporting that a cruise ship. I can't remember what the name was, but I think here recently, they just resurfaced it or something, and that it was basically almost exactly like, how my dream was, like, to a T, the cruise ship basically sunk sideways. And after it was out of the water, laptop was completely under. So I had a dream like that. And I also had, like, a bunch of instances where I'll say something like, without any knowledge of, like, it existing. When I was a kid, like, I remember thinking that it would be cool if, like, you know, some of the Avengers had kids and, like, they had their own custom superpowers and stuff. And then I remember seeing the movie with that exact concept, like, maybe a week later. And when I was a kid also, there's a behavioral health place here in Missouri called Heartland for, like, kids and stuff that are, like, misbehaving and stuff. And I was put in there a couple of times when I was a kid. And I remember they had a fire, and there's a cemetery, like, just outside of it, like, area. And it's, like, all for that facility. And it used to have, like, a bunch of nuns and stuff in it. And I remember when I was in there that we had a fire drill and they had these, like, bay padded rooms with a door that, like, locked electronically. And it was open because no one was using that, like, area we were in. And we were all talking with the staff, and it slammed shut by itself. And there was another time I was in that same one when it was being used when I was even younger. And we were looking out and you could see, like, up on this, like, little walkway balcony that had glass all over it, and there was no one else there. And me and, like, two other kids saw, like, this lady in white kind of staring out the window at us. And when we went to go get a staff member to see it, the staff member came over, she was gone. And all the doors there were, like, specifically locked so only staff members could get to and from out of them. Love your podcast. I'm on Patreon with you. Keep up what you're doing. Love it all.
