[Speaker C] Hey Derek, this is Nate from Eastern Idaho. This experience happened in the early to mid-90s. I was probably, you know, around 11 or 12. My brother had recently moved down to southern Utah and gotten married so my brothers drove us down to visit him and he was living in an older one bedroom apartment complex on the second floor. So at night my parents got the couches to sleep on and I got to sleep on the living room floor. Well, the place I was sleeping looked straight through the living room down the hall towards the bathroom and bedroom. The little kitchen in this place was just off to the right before the hallway. So it was pretty late at night, maybe 12 1am and I just couldn't sleep because of the heat. I believe this was late July, probably close to 100 degrees outside and the ceiling fan was almost directly above me. It just wasn't helping out. So there I was just listening to my Walkman cassette player when movement in the hallway just caught my eye. It looked like my brother was coming down the hallway but you know, it didn't look like him at the same time. It was just different. He looked almost transparent like and he seemed to be coming directly at me without moving. Wasn't until he got closer. I looked up and saw his head seemingly go right through the fan blades without affecting them or him. He wasn't that tall so I was confused and looked down to see him floating close to almost a foot off the ground. When I looked back up, he was straight above me. He looked right at me, put his pointer finger to his lips in kind of a shushing gesture, and then floated to the kitchen, to the main door, and then disappeared through it. You know, I don't think I moved the rest of the night. I just lay there, scared and confused. I never saw my brother come back in, if, you know, that was my brother. But when morning finally did arrive, his bedroom door opened. I just stared at him, not even responding to him when he said, good morning. He looks fully normal now. And I was hoping he'd make a comment about whatever happened the night before, but he never did. He just behaved like nothing ever happened. Well, I never told anybody this story because, honestly, it confused the hell out of me and couldn't explain it. So it wasn't until I got some of your episodes about the living hauntings and astral projection that it hit me that Esma explained what I saw those years ago. Thank you so much for the podcast, Eric. I really appreciate the platform. Have a great one. Thank you.
