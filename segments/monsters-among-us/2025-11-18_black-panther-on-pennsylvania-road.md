[Speaker B] My name's Kim. I'm from home, Pennsylvania. It was a night, it was probably in the summer and I was driving home, I just dropped my friend off. I'm guessing I was young. I just got my driver's license. It was dark and I saw something on the side of the road so I slowed down and stopped. It looked like a black panther and I didn't believe it but my car was stopped. And then it like went out in front of my car, looked at me and then it went into the woods. It felt like I sat there for 10 minutes, there was no one else coming on the road. And then I drove home and went into my parents house and basically collapsed because I was just like, I just saw this thing and it didn't scare me, but it was just like, what the hell? I just saw a black panther and I live in western Pennsylvania and my parents just looked at me like I was nuts. I get to see a black panther. You can saw bobcat. You saw whatever. I'm like, nope, I know what a bobcat looks like. This is not a bobcat. But since then I'm now 47. This is when I was 16. This is probably back in the 80s. I've had so many experiences. I think I might be sensitive, but that is something that has stood out to me. I'm not crazy, but I saw it with my own eyes and it was incredible. And no one believed me. This cut my mouth shut, but thank you for giving me a platform to share that. I'm sorry for crying. You have a great day.
