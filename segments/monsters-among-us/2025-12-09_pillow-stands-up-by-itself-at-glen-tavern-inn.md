[Speaker C] Hello, Derek and company. My name is Bird and I'm from Los Angeles, California. The Silver Lake area, to be very specific. My husband is a location manager and we were on location in Santa Paula, California around 2007. We were staying at the Glen Tavern Inn, which has a historical participation in a horrible tragedy. A dam burst close by a long.

[Speaker D] Time ago in the early 1900s. And a lot of people, people died.

[Speaker C] And the Glen Tavern Inn became a refuge for survivors. It was an ugly situation.

[Speaker D] Plus there were two murders in the hotel. I believe one was a prostitute.

[Speaker C] And that was in 307. That's a very, very known haunted room.

[Speaker D] And then one was a gambler, lost his life.

[Speaker C] Oh, and by the way, I knew.

[Speaker D] All about this place historically and paranormally fire before walking in.

[Speaker C] So we had to Stay three nights and the first two were spent in.

[Speaker D] The renovated suite where there was no activity whatsoever.

[Speaker C] I actually walked the halls at midnight.

[Speaker D] Using my phone, looking for paranormal trouble. And I found none.

[Speaker C] Anyway, so on the last night of our stay, we were in the room.

[Speaker D] Directly below where the murder is of.

[Speaker C] The prostitute occurred, which was 207. I heard some talk about her head.

[Speaker D] Being removed from her body, but I don't know.

[Speaker C] I was a smoker at the time and an insomniac. I awoke about 5 o' clock to go downstairs outside to smoke and sit in the lobby afterwards. It was grand, all dark hardwood everywhere.

[Speaker D] It was a really beautiful hotel.

[Speaker C] I lounged about the lobby because it was busy with people and activities as well as being pretty. Even though I was not participating in the activities, it was fun to watch. The first people were early birds running to catch their hot air balloons, which is an annual activity. Then the second thing that happened was this big travel bus that said Antelope Valley Paranormal Investigators or something like that. I talked to a few of the participants people on the bus for a long time, about an hour and a half. And we had a lot in common. Especially when I mentioned a fairly famous local English medium named Brian.

[Speaker D] I forgot his last name.

[Speaker C] And he was just so fabulous.

[Speaker D] And we all confirmed our love for him.

[Speaker C] So now I return to my husband and I've been gone for two good hours, smoking and talking and talking and smoking. When I came back, I was met with adoration and. And just like anxiety as well. He pulled me into the bed. He wanted to spoon. Now, this was not the kind of man who showed his affection that way. He was affectionate. He would, you know, hold me and kiss me.

[Speaker D] But he never wanted to really cuddle in bed. That was not his thing at all.

[Speaker C] Anyway, so then he tells me what happened while I was gone. He had been somewhat of a skeptic because he woke up with something and what he believed was my arm sticking straight up in the air under the covers. And he swatted it down, only to find it was my kingsize pillow propped up perfectly straight under the COVID stiff and kept a blanket up like a tent. He was kind of freaked out. He was like, what's this? And he didn't know what to make of it. And he goes into now quickly. So he shakes it off and goes to the bathroom. And when he comes back, it's back up straight again under the covers. It completely freaked him out and he.

[Speaker D] Just didn't know what to do.

[Speaker C] And it was this old pillow on top of it, it was old and soft, so it's hard to be stiff and it's kind of impossible for it.

[Speaker D] To be stiff under there.

[Speaker C] So anyway, I'm so glad to share the story. Thank you for your hard work. Please know we appreciate every minute.
