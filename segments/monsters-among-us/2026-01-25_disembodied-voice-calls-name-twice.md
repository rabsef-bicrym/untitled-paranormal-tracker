[Speaker C] Hi Derek, this is Saidi from Alabama. Huge fan of the podcast and I appreciate everybody calling in with their stories. I really enjoy hearing discovery stories and knowing, you know, that you're not alone in some of your experiences. And so I thought it's about time I call in some of my own. And I've got quite a few, but this one I'm calling about is about my childhood home and in Iowa. So we moved into this brand new ranch home when I was 10. It was me, my mom, my sister, and things started happening right away and we would hear pacing along the length of the house and there was no attic. There was like two feet of space in the attic. So no one was up in the attic. And you'd go outside and there'd be nobody on the roof and. But you could clearly hear someone pacing with footsteps the length of the house. You know, everybody would hear this, Family, friends, you name it. So it was really eerie and odd for a new house to immediately be haunted. So we would have lights come on, things moving, normal haunted stuff. So the two main experiences I had, the first one, I was home alone and I was recording music off the radio and I started recording one song and I went into the kitchen to make myself some food and I wasn't really paying attention and the song stopped and someone started talking and I wasn't paying attention at all because that's, you know, normal. It happens until they said my name and they said my full name, my first, middle and last. And then a pause and the song started up again. And I thought, oh my gosh, did I win something? What was that about? And so I run over, rewind it, and it's just the song. There was no talking, nobody said my name. And so I was freaked out, obviously. But I could also kind of pass it off as, oh, maybe it was in my head. There was no one else there to back me up, so I kind of blew it off. Well, a couple years later, a friend of mine and me were in my kitchen about to do like an all nighter study session for finals. And we're the only ones in the house and we're having a good time talking and I'm making ramen noodles at the. At the stove, and she's behind me at the kitchen table and we're just chatting. And the only way I can describe it is if a giant were trying to whisper because it was really loud, but it was also a whisper. And it, it said Heidi. Said my name, Heidi. And I just again, like, okay, it's in my head. And I keep talking. She has grown quiet. And it happens again. It goes, Heidi. And I whip around thinking it's her messing with me and she is ghost white. And she just says, oh my God, it knows your name. And I instantly was like, oh, crap, it's not in my head. This is actually happening. It does know my name. So we got knives and we're running around and there was nobody outside the house. There was no windows open. It was the middle of the winter, so everything was sealed up and nobody was in the house. So there was no explanation for where this disembodied voice came from. So that was pretty freaky. But those were the two main things for my childhood home. I have others that I'll call about about some really frightening ones, so can't wait to share those. Anyway, I hope you enjoy this one and you can use it. And thanks again for all you guys. All do. Thanks. Bye.
