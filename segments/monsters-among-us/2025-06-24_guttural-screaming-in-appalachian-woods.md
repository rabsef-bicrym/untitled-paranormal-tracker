[Speaker D] Hey there, this is Greg. I'm from Appalachia. I'm actually from east central Ohio and this is something that happened to me last night, actually less than 24 hours ago. So my family has lived in the middle of absolutely nowhere for generations and generations. And every time one of the elders in our family passes away, someone tends to inherit their house. So we've been there for When I say generations, I mean generations. And last night me and my mom were visiting my brother at his house. And to paint you a little picture, all of our houses are very close together, kind of family farm style. And the nearest village is a 20 minute drive and the nearest actual town is pushing closer to 45 minutes away, middle of nowhere. And we were there last night about 8 o' clock probably. We'd just been visiting and we're walking back across his yard now. His yard is about an acre. It's a big yard. So we're walking back to the car. And as we're walking, pitch black, clear night, no wind, no noises from the woods. We hear this scream. And it's like a deep, guttural, angry scream. And we freeze. And we're like, what the hell was that? And it comes again. We hear it again, and it is like nothing I have ever heard before. I have lived in these woods for 24 years. My mom has lived in these woods for nearing 50 years. And neither one of us has ever heard anything like that ever before. And I'm thinking, is it one of the horses? But a horse can't make that sound. And we've got bobcats and coyotes and deer in these woods, and none of them can make that kind of sound. It was a scream, like a long, drawn out, angry sounding, guttural, like, deep scream. And it carried across the woods, and it sounded like it couldn't have been more than like 100, 200 yards away. And it just like, my blood went cold, I was so scared. And then it did it a third time. And then, of course, we take off. We're running for the car at this point. We hear it one more time before we get in the car. And on the way home. We only lived about 10 minutes down the gravel road on the way home. We're looking and we're looking, and we don't see anything near the road or in the woods. No eyeshadow, no nothing. And, oh, my gosh, I'm still scared. It's like I said, less than 24 hours ago. And, oh, I am very afraid to go out in those woods right now. But, yeah, my dad suggested maybe it was a deer growling, because apparently deer can growl. So I looked that up, and that wasn't it. And it wasn't a bobcat, and it was not a noise a coyote could make. And all the horses are fine. It sounded almost like a cow, like a bull. You know the sound when a bull gets really angry? It almost sounded kind of like that. But we don't have cows, and the nearest cows are two or three miles down the holler. And none of the farmers around there have asked us about missing any. And it. I don't know, it just. I can't explain it. So. Looking forward to hearing what you have to say about that one. Hopefully somebody's got some kind of an idea, because my only thought is some kind of bigfoot, maybe. And we do live near, like, the salt fork lake region, so maybe. But, yeah, I Don't know. Thanks.

[Speaker B] Thank you, Gray. That's Grassman country, Ohio's version of Bigfoot. In fact, there's a region in that area that many refer to as the Sasquatch Triangle. That's the area in which I grew up. And in fact, that area is where one of the most infamous pieces of Bigfoot audio was recorded. It's known as the Ohio howl, and it was recorded back in 1994 in Columbiana county, some 40 to 50 miles northeast of where Gray was calling from. Here is a quick sample of that recording. Ra. Recorded by finding Bigfoot's mad moneymaker, if I remember correctly. So that could be one more explanation. Gray, as you mentioned, I grew up just down the road, less than 20 miles from Salt Fork, in fact. And I, too, have heard the legends and heard from folks in the area that claim to have heard similar sounds. And Ohio does rank fourth in Bigfoot sightings per state. So I guess you never know what might be out there either way. Thank you again, Gray, for sharing that gnarly entry. Now, folks, speaking of monsters, this next entry is pretty wild. Please put your hands together for Molly.
