[Speaker B] Hi Derek, this is Autumn from Minnesota. I just have a quick kind of light hearted story. Back in the summer of 2015, I lived with my grandparents and my grandma had passed away that summer kind of suddenly and it was like very traumatic for me and my family but I still lived with my grandpa. And this event happened. It couldn't have been more than a month after my grandma passed away. I believe it was a few weeks after. And I was in the kitchen and I was looking for a specific utensil. I can't recall exactly what utensil it was, but I was looking for some utensil that I couldn't find. And I swear I tore that kitchen apart just nearly. I looked everywhere and my grandma was a pretty prolific baker and she loved to cook and stuff. And I was like stressed out, just kind of like where is this? And I just kind of stopped for a moment and I just thought of my grandma was like, I really wish my grandma was here for many reasons, but I really wish she was here because I have no idea where this utensil is. And right after, you know, I kind of thought that I heard her voice in my head and it wasn't my voice. Like the little voice that most people have in their heads where they have a conversation like mine's very talkative. It wasn't that voice, it was in my grandmother's voice. And she said check the dishwasher. And I had already checked the dishwasher. Like that was one of the first places I had looked. But I just after hearing her in my head, I was like, okay. And I go and I check the dishwasher, and it was right there in the dishwasher. We've been listening to your show every day, and you mentioned the story your dad had about hearing a voice telling him not to put bleach on his jeans. It was going to ruin his jeans. And it just kind of jogged this memory for me. I don't know exactly if it was my grandma's spirit, you know, coming back to help me or whatnot, but it was definitely weird because I had checked the dishwasher washer. But thanks again for the podcast. Really love the show. Keep doing the good work. Thank you. Bye.
