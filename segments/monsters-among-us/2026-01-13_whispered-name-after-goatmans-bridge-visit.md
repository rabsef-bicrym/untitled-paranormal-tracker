[Speaker B] Hi, Derek. This is Bella calling from Dallas, Texas. So it's important to note that before this story takes place, I had just visited Goatman's Bridge in Denton, Texas, with my mom, because we're both super into that kind of thing. And we actually ended up meeting up with some group that had been formed on, like, the nextdoor app of moms that liked Paranormal stuff and they were super cool and my mom loved hanging out with them and we ended up doing like a TikTok investigation where they live streamed it and had a really great time doing that. So we eventually left because I honestly got a little weirded out by the whole thing at a certain point, point I didn't have a good feeling. So we ended up leaving after a while. Also another strange thing to note is that following that experience for maybe two weeks or so, I would be like ordering food just at various places and it would always be like, oh, I would be customer number 666 or my total would come out to be $6.66. This happened at least four or five times in like a two week span at different restaurants. So anyways, onto the story. This story takes place about a week later. I just recently graduated with my bachelor's degree and I'm currently working as a vet tech waiting on the results of my applications to different vet schools. So I work right now at a super small clinic with just one doctor and four staff members, including myself. So a couple weeks ago we were closing up the clinic for the day and I was the first one walking out the back door. My co worker was holding the door open to the alley where we park our cars and I was facing that same alleyway. I was just looking forward and I heard a very, very clear, hushed Bella from behind me. So I turn around, look at my co workers and all of them are looking back at me confused. And I stood there for a second, just said, what? And they all started laughing, asking if I was okay. And I replied, just saying like, okay, well one of you said my name. But they were all just sitting there quiet and confused and they just said none of them had said anything at all. So we laughed it off. And I just assumed that I was exhausted and I just needed some rest. Quick side note, by this point in my job, I had been driving myself absolutely insane, seeing things out of the corner of my eyes. But I chalked it up to just being surrounded by death all the time with all the euthanasias and just being freaked out about it. So the next day at work, it was a pretty slow part of the day and I was filling a prescription for one of our patients. At this point, we had nobody in the building except for myself, two co workers and my boss, who's extremely quiet and reserved. So once again I heard an extremely clear, more clear than the day before, hushed Bella from behind me. So I was like, okay, somebody's trying to get my attention. So I was gonna finish filling the prescription, so I didn't lose track of what I was doing. I, you know, turned the corner and replied, you know, what's up? And they looked at me and just said, nothing. And once again, I was like, okay, well, which one of you needed something? And they both replied, we don't need anything. Like, what's up? And I was just like, okay, well, one of you needed something from me. And they just said, no. We've been completely silent this whole time. So I was getting frustrated at this point. And I was like, if y' all are messing with me, I need to know now, or I'm gonna go check myself into a ward. But they swore up and down that they weren't messing with me. And I've asked a million times, and I believe them that they were not. So also important to note that I have awful hearing. And in retrospect, if they had even said my name in a normal tone of voice from that distance, I would.

[Speaker D] Not have heard it.

[Speaker B] My hearing is bad, but it's also selective. And 99% of the time, when somebody's talking to me, like, directly to me, right next to me, I don't even hear it. So, same day, I was on my lunch break, went to Target to shop for birthday presents for my boyfriend, who I was gonna go visit the following week. And I was walking down an aisle that was along the backside of the store, which had, like, smaller aisles perpendicular to it. And on the left side, where that shelving unit was, on the very bottom shelf, there was a bunch of spools of Christmas lights and not a single person in the aisle. Nothing was moving in the aisles that connected to it. No shaking of the floor or anything. One of the spools of Christmas lights falls off the shelf, rolls across the aisle, and lands and stops directly in front of my feet, like a foot, even if that. And just sits there. And I was just like, okay, I guess this is how my day's going. I looked around. Nobody was there. The shelf wasn't moving. Nothing else in the entire shelf moved, shifted, shaked, fell, anything. So I tell my co workers about it, and they just kind of laugh it off, and they just think I'm crazy. So I told my mom about everything after the whole day ended, and I'm not very religious, but she was just like, oh, I'll pray for you. And like, this is awful. And I was just like, this is more inconvenient for me at this point point than anything. Like, I was just getting irritated, but she was genuinely concerned. And I was just like, well, I appreciate your concern. And she's like, you need to pray, too. And I'm like, okay, whatever is going to help you sleep at night, I guess. But yeah, I mean, after that, not a single thing has happened since. I still see things out of the corner of my eye every once in a while, but it could very well just be my eyesight being bad or my hair or. Or being tired, I don't know. But I really enjoy the show and I hope that you can use this. Bye.
