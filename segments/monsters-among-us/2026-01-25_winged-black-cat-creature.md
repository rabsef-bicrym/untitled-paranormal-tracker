[Speaker B] Hey Derek, this is Jake from Green Bay. I am one of your patrons, if that's important. So it's Memorial Day. I've waited a few hours to call you. I was riding my brand new motorcycle this morning, a 650 ninja. I was out in the country east of Green Bay, Wisconsin. But there's only one Green Bay and something kind of big cat was jet black. It didn't look furry and it had wings kind of half folded in. It was really close to the ground. It crossed whatever the small road was and got down in by a creek and a lot of foliage and I never saw it again. I'm going to be really nervous to hear my voice, but I look forward to it. Thank you. Bye.
