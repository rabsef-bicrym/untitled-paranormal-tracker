[Speaker A] Hey, Monsters Among Us. This is Robin from Texas. This was probably 20 years ago. I was living in Burleson, Texas, and I had my horses sported out in Crowley, Texas, and I would travel twice a day to go see them and feed them and take care of them. It was often dark when I would come back at night. And I did see a lot of things in the sky because it was open and I was kind of paying attention to the sky. But on this one particular night, it was in the summer, I had my windows down. It was a warm night in late July, that was probably 10 o' clock at night driving down 1187 Crowley Road. And all of a sudden I see this white, perfectly round orb fall from the top of the sky to the tree line. I don't know A thousand feet in front of me at an incredible speed. And while I'm trying to process this, I'm at a four way stop and there's nobody except for one other person next to me that has pulled up to the stoplight. And when I'm processing this, all of a sudden these colors come up out of the forested area and they shoot straight up from the bottom of the tree line all the way to the top of the sky. And the only way I can describe it is if you took a glass of milk and you put food coloring in there, it would stay. And the colors would stay separate and would spin around and be these unusual designs. So there's no way at all that this was fireworks or anything like that. This was just huge swaths of color. And there were red and blue and green fuchsia. The biggest swaths of color were white. And these look like lightning strikes coming up from the forested area to the top of the sky. And it only lasted a few seconds. I looked over to the guy next to me and he rolled his window down and all I could think of was, oh, I hope he saw this, because I see things and no one ever sees them with me. And he said, I saw that too. I said, what is that? And he goes, I don't know. And we just kind of went on our way. A week, maybe a month later, I'm at my house in Burleson and my daughter's in college, so I live by myself. I have this house that was built in the early 90s. It has these windows that go from the floor to the ceiling just about. And in my bedroom there are two of those. And there's a courtyard right behind my bedroom with a locked door date. I have this big 90 pound American Bulldog. And he's very sweet, but he's also protective. So that's one way I would let him out. If he had to go to the bathroom at night, I would just open the window and let him out and he would scratch on the window and I'd let him back in. So I did that one night and I started to lay down and I hear a bark. That is. I've never heard him bark like this. It was apparent when I heard it. It's an intruder. You need to get out of here. I'm getting ready to open the window and look out, fully expecting to see a person in the yard that he's got cornered back there, but there isn't. He is barking up at a white orb that is perfectly round and perfectly the most incredibly Beautiful white thing I have ever seen. I couldn't see through it, but it glowed from within. And if you took my Toyota Corolla that I have and rounded it into a perfect ball, that would be about the size of this thing. It couldn't have been any higher than 10ft off the ground. I don't know if people will think I'm crazy or not, but it happened. So I don't know what else to say. And I actually have never told anybody this except my sister. So this glowing white orb has, coming out of the side of it, maybe a little bit wider than the width of an arm, a beam of light that doesn't come out of a portal or anything. It just comes out of the side of it, and it's shining directly at Buddy. The beam stops about probably 2ft away from him. And the light is white and clear, but it has, like, particles in it. It's hard to explain. But anyway, I could see this. I call it a skin on the outside of this thing because it was like if a craft could be alive. I knew immediately when I saw it that it was alive. It was into craft. It was a living thing. And I could see how the outside skin layer, or whatever it was, was made. It was just so pure white. And so Buddy's barking at this thing, and it was like, I knew immediately. And I don't know if it was telling me this or I just knew it, but I knew it didn't want Buddy. It wasn't trying to hurt him. It just wanted me to come out and look at me. And I was looking at it, and I was hanging out halfway out the window, and I yelled, buddy. And he turned around and looked at me with this look, like, oh, thank God. And he ran as fast as he could into the house, and we slammed the window down, and Buddy jumped on the bed, and I jumped under the covers. All I could think of was, I know this isn't really a safe place, but I just want to get under the covers, close my eyes, and I don't care if it comes after me. I just want to be asleep when it does. I don't want to know. And I could feel Buddy jumping off the bed and running toward the front of the house. So at the time in my mind, I was thinking, well, it's crossing over the house and he's following it. That's kind of what I was thinking. And I don't remember what happened after that. I do remember it the next morning, but I don't remember anything else that happened. After Buddy got off the bed. Anyway, that's my story. Thank you so much for having this podcast and for allowing people like me a way to tell our stories so others can hear it. Bye bye.
