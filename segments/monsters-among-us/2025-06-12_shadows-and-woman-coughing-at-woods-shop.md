[Speaker C] Hey, Derek. This is Kyle calling from Michigan. My call comes from a shop I used to work at. Anybody from Michigan knows where Lapeer is? It's further east of Lapeer in a little town called Capac. This shop is kind of in the woods, a little bit surrounded by cornfields. There's woods on the back side of it and it's got four buildings. And I've noticed whenever I started working there, I started on night shift. And I noticed that I always got a weird feeling in that shop. And I started noticing whenever I worked in the fourth building, which is over more into the woods, I would hear noises. One time I heard a woman coughing when I was the only one in the whole building. It was like right in my ear. I've noticed shadows around the corners of the machines too. Solid black shadows, kind of peeping around. Almost kind of like a hide behind. Then I was talking to a guy I work with and he said that one time he heard his name being called in the woods and he said there was a windigo and he left a tobacco offering like you're supposed to. And he hasn't had any issues with it since then. I brushed him off. So that's nonsense. You know, I believe in the paranormal stuff, but that's a little too far fetched for me. But whenever I told him that, I started seeing a lot more shadows. I don't know if it was a windigo so much as the woods were more haunted. I'm not 100 sure, but I do know that I always felt like I was being watched. And I felt like it was some kind of old restless spirit in the woods trying to play tricks on me. Huge fan of the show and I hope you have a great day.
