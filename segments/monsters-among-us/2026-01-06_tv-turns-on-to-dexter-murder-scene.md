[Speaker C] Hi, Derek, my name's Josh. I'm from Australia. I haven't really had many experiences, but one thing that I have had happen.

[Speaker A] To me, which was just sort of.

[Speaker C] A kind of creepy thing, it definitely.

[Speaker A] Isn'T something that can't be explained through normal things. It was just kind of weird.

[Speaker C] I was probably about 14, 15, I was lying in bed trying to get to sleep.

[Speaker A] It probably would have been about 9, 9:30 at night. And the TV in my bedroom just randomly switched on. The show that it switched onto was actually Dexter, and it was a scene.

[Speaker C] Where he was talking to somebody and describing how he enjoyed killing people and how it felt.

[Speaker A] And it really creeped me the hell out. I think either of those things on.

[Speaker C] Their own, like my TV randomly switching on could just be an issue. If I switched on the TV and it happened to go on to that particular channel with that scene, it's a.

[Speaker A] Bit creepy, but, you know, I've just.

[Speaker C] Switched on the tv, whatever. But just those two things together was.

[Speaker A] Just really kind of creepy.

[Speaker C] And my remote wasn't under anything. Nothing could have pressed a button.

[Speaker A] The only thing that could have happened.

[Speaker C] Is there was some weird thing wrong with the TV and it just randomly switched on. But again, that has never happened at all since. It was just a really strange incident.

[Speaker A] That happened and I've never really had anything like that happen again.

[Speaker G] But.

[Speaker A] Yeah, have a good one. Thanks.

[Speaker C] Bye.
