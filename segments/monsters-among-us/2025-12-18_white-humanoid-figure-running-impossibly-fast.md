[Speaker B] Hi, Derek. My name is Taylor. I live in Rhode Island. This story, I was about 10 years old at the time when this happened, and I'm 32 now. So it's stuck with me all these years, and I think about it from time to time. But I had a few weird encounters as a kid in the house that I grew up in. And I often didn't tell my family about them just because, you know, I was either scared or I would also try to rationalize or play them off kind of in order to calm myself down. I'll never forget one story in particular. I was at home alone, which happened often. My mom was a single mom, and I had an older brother, but he was a teenager at the time, and so he was out a lot with his friends or working or whatever. And I was in my bedroom. I was kind of potsing around and redecorating the space, which I often did. I was very creative and artistic kid. Anyways, I was in my room, and out of the corner of my eye, I saw a white humanoid figure run incredibly fast, like, impossibly fast past my bedroom door. But enough at a pace where I was able to, like, out of the corner of my eye, make out like a very clearly humanoid figure, which, the way the house was set up, my bedroom and my brother's bedroom were all the way at the end of the hall. There couldn't have been more than, like, three feet of space before reaching the wall at the end of my hallway. So there would have just been nowhere for this figure to go. And it was running so fast, it would have just plowed through the wall. And I screamed out loud. And I was so frightened that I called my mom at work, and she stayed on the phone with me. She worked down the street, and I knew she'd be coming home soon, so she stayed on the phone with me until she pulled in the driveway, which was, I think, the only time I really needed her to do that. When I was young, I was a very independent kid. I kind of had to be only having one parent in the house. So the experience stands out for that reason too, because I was so scared in that moment that I just sat on my bed facing my door for a good half hour while I was on the phone with her before she got home. And my mom was very rational and calm all the time, and she just focused on calming me down, which she was very good at. Anyway, so she gets home, I kind of calm down, and we go about the evening, but I was still a little shaken up by it. So the next day we find out from one of our neighbors that our elderly neighbor across the street, she was a very sweet older woman. She had passed away the day before. So the same day that I had seen the figure and she passed away in the home. And I remember being so freaked out by that because I immediately thought, oh, my God, I wonder if that was her. And I've often wondered if what I saw was her, like crossing over to the other side or if I saw her spirit or something like that. I have a few stories from that house, things that I saw growing up, but that one definitely stands out a little bit more than the others. Anyway, I love the show, absolutely love it. I've been listening to it non stop, so keep it up. Thank you.
