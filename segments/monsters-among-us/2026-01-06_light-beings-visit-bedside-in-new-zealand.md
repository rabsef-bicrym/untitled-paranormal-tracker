[Speaker D] Hey there, this is Eli and I am calling from Aotearoa, New Zealand, and I wanted to share an experience that I had when I was a very small child. So this would have happened around 92, 93, when I was three or four. These are some of the earliest memories I have. It's very vivid to me still, even, you know, 30 odd years later. So what would happen is when I was in bed and I would be awake when this happened, like sort of I'd already awoken. I wouldn't wake up to the experience more so I would awake and then the experience would happen. So I would wake up and I would turn my head to look into the room and these beings, I guess these apparitions would appear. There was always two of them. They were small, like low to the ground. And they were essentially, I guess, made out of light, like a white light that was brighter in the middle and sort of faded out around the edges of them. And the best way I can describe the shape is like the corner of a blanket. And not just in shape, but in some way. It was almost like it was fabric. Like they were made out of fabric that was made out of light. They didn't have features, there were no faces, there were no limbs. But there was a definite three points to them with the point at the top and then two at the bottom. Just like a triangle, like think of a comforter, a duvet. It was sort of like that, but I got the sense that it wasn't filled with anything like a sort of billowed out fabric corner, but made out of light. So they would be there and they would be sort of speaking directly into my brain, I suppose, and saying that they had something very important that they had to tell me. They had some very important information. And please don't be afraid because we have to tell you. Of course I would be very afraid. So I remember hiding under the blankets and after a little while I would peek out and they would be gone. So I can't say if this happened every night, but it happened a lot. And it didn't stop happening until we moved out of the house that we were in. So just before I turned five. And it honestly got to the point where it was happening so often that I almost wasn't scared anymore. But the thing is, I still did not want to talk to them. I didn't want to have anything to do with them. So they would appear, I would meet immediately, put the blanket over my head and then take it off and they would be gone. So it was almost like it became a signal for them to leave. Strange thing is, my sister slept in the same room with me and she was a bit older, she was around 7 or 8. But she was never awake when any of this happened. And to be honest, we did not have a great relationship as we got older. So it was never anything I bought up to her. Unfortunately, she's no longer with us, so it's not something I can ask her about now. I don't recall telling my mum any of this at the time. I think possibly just because as a very small child, I don't think I really had the language to explain what was happening. But I do remember telling her as I got older. And she told me that quite often she would hear footsteps up and down the hallway in the house and that there was one particular room that was sort of like a playroom. The door would be closed, no one would be in there. And she would hear sort of shuffling around and like, and very low voices as if there were people in there. So maybe the whole house was haunted. I don't know the history of the house. It was very old. The suburb that it was in is one of like the earliest in the country, really. The only other thing that happened to me personally in the house was I would also have a recurring dream. It was a very linear dream and I was an observer rather than a subject in the dream. It didn't seem related to these apparitions at all either, which is strange. But there we go. So were the two connected? Who would know? Thank you so much for having this podcast and giving people the chance to tell their stories and. Yeah, bye.
