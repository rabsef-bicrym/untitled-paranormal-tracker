[Speaker C] Hey, Derek, Nick from Chicago here. This happened a couple months ago, so it was July or August, so I was sleeping with my window open. My apartment backs up to an alley that runs throughout the houses of my street. A lot of driveways back there. People take their trash out, things of that nature. So laying there asleep, have to get up for work pretty soon. So my alarm's about to go off, but something jolted me up about 15 minutes before. My alarm is set for My headboard is right next to the window at this point. So just laying there, complete silence. And then all of a sudden, something says something. And the best way to describe it, kind of hard to describe, is it was the scream. But it started off, almost sounded like normal talking, and then it kind of progressed into this deep kind of growl, slash, scream. And it sounded like it was definitely coming from the alley in the back of my apartment. And what it sounded like was someone was, you know, at first kind of calling for, like, a pet to come inside. You'd imagine someone left their dog outside, they're calling the pet's name to come back inside. But then as the sentence kind of went on, I kind of progressed into, like I said, this deep kind of growl, scream. And it was really bizarre because right after this happened, just complete silence, really. No other noises after I heard this weird scream, talking. I think if it was, you know, someone taking out their pet or calling to get their pet inside, you drew some other noise after, whether it's the dog moving around or doors opening and closing, but just complete silence after this. So not really sure what to think of it. Haven't heard anything since that's similar. But, you know, I do want to say that sometimes there's homeless people that kind of travel throughout the alleys in our neighborhood. So it could have been, you know, someone walking through the alley early in the morning, and maybe they were just upset about something, but it didn't really sound like something that, you know, a human really could be making it. To be honest with you, it was pretty deep. And like I said, it sounded like it was really coming from the gut. Pretty creepy. Not sure exactly what could have caused it, but thought it was kind of cool with the recent Mothman sightings we've had here. So I love the podcast. Looking forward to the next episode. Thanks, Eric.
