[Speaker D] Hi Derek, My name is Zach. I live in Dubuque, Iowa. A few years ago I went down to Ottumwa, Iowa, which is southeastern Iowa, to spend a weekend at my in law's house and we were using their primary bathroom, my wife and I, and to get into the primary bedroom and the bathroom from the hallway. There's a room before those rooms. It's like a powder room that has the closets. It's a somewhat older house for Iowa. It's probably 100 years old. It's a long house. So this is one end of the house that the primary bedroom sits on top of. And so like the kitchen is at the exact opposite end of the house. My sister in law was out of the house. I believe my father in law was down at his work. I believe my mother in law was in the kitchen at the opposite end of the house. I think my wife had gone to take a nap, but she had just used the bathroom in the primary bedroom before me. And I closed the door from the hallway into the powder room and then the door to the bathroom and she had just finished and I was in there showering and it wasn't very long in the shower. And I remember ending the shower and hearing what I thought was someone trying to talk to me from the other side of the door. And again, this is A very long house. And she was downstairs kind of towards the middle part of the house. And pretty sure my mother in law was at the opposite end of the kitchen. And I thought it might have been my wife who had forgotten something. And so I think I remember saying something like, hold on one second. And I heard a little bit more of like a murmur talk. It was muffled. And as I went to reach for the bathroom door, there was this big bang on the other side of the door. And I thought maybe she was frustrated and I didn't get to the door quick enough or something had happened or she bumped into it. And it was almost like an angry hit with a fist or your foot. And I remember trying to throw the towel on really quick and open up the door to look. And I opened up the bathroom door and there was nobody in the powder room. And the door from the powder room to the hallway was still closed. And I remember shutting the bathroom door, getting dressed, and then going to the hallway just a few minutes later to see if there was anybody upstairs or if something had happened. Nobody was upstairs. I remember going downstairs thinking, did somebody come in through the front door? Nobody had come home. So this was an unexplainable event. And I remember explaining it to my in laws and they didn't like to hear about it. There's been other kind of questionable things at their house that has happened, but we're trying to be logic about it and explain it away. But this was one that I tried to be logic about it, but there is kind of an unexplainable. If nobody was in the area, what was it that I heard and who hit the door? Again, it could have been something from outside, could have been a door closing somewhere, but nobody was closing anything. And again, the kitchen is way at the other end and there's no doors to close in the kitchen. So just thought I'd share this, but I love your podcast. Keep it up. Thanks.
