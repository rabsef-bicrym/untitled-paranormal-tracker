I currently live in Portland. But this story took place in my hometown of Jervis. It was a UFO thing, which is funny because I don't really tend to, like, believe the UFO stuff. Like, it's not something I tend to think about. It was A nice sunny day. Sun was slowly starting to set. I was in a car with my family. It was my mom, my dad, my three sisters and me. And we are heading home from some sort of event. And we're all in the family car. It's probably like 17, and we're driving and I look out the window and I see an aircraft. I typically don't believe in the UFO type things. And I'm like, oh, maybe it's a military aircraft. Because like our farm airspace was being used by military. And I was so used to seeing all the military aircraft, but it was just this weird black oblong shape that was big on one end and tapered down to something smaller. I couldn't see any wings, no flashing lights. I was really, really confused. And honestly, I had no idea what was going on. I'm like, mom, you guys see that? And they're like, oh, yeah, that's weird.\n\n[Speaker D] It looks really weird.\n\n[Speaker A] So I'm like, as soon as we get home, which was like, any minute now, I'm gonna hop in the gator and I'm gonna go check that out. I'm gonna take dad's binoculars. And this thing was super slow moving, super low to the ground. I could see details on it, but it didn't have any military logos. Nothing, nothing going on. And as soon as we get home down a half mile long dirt road, I hopped in the gator with the binoculars and I book. It took less than a minute as soon as I got out of that car to get to the end of the driveway. And it was such a slow moving thing that you think it'd still be there. By the time I got to the end of the driveway, it was gone, completely gone. Like it evaporated from the sky. There was no sign of it anywhere. I looked in the skyline, nowhere, and it was still light out. Like it wasn't like super dark or anything. It was still blue sky, slightly red, but other than that, I couldn't see anything. So that is my UFO story. I don't really have many of them. That was my first time seeing a ufo. My grandmother has an experience on that property with the ufo, but then again, I ain't sure.

So this was around 1977. My family at the time was migrant workers, so we lived in South Texas, but we would drive up to Wisconsin and Michigan and Arkansas for seasonal work. And I tell you this to go along with my story. Like I said, summer about 1977 or so, my stepdad had been picked up for a dui, so my mom and his brother had to drive up to pick him up from jail. At the time I was about 4, maybe 5 years old and so I was sitting in the backseat, it was dark outside, it was summer. I believe we were in Wisconsin or Michigan, one of those two, and I could hear my mom and his brother chatting about whatever was going on with the incident that had occurred. Then all of a sudden, my mom's tone, her voice changed and I could tell that she was concerned. And she said to the driver, his name was Roy. She said, do you see that? What is that? What do you think that is? And so that alerted me. And like I said, I was sitting in the backseat. So I slowly crept up from the backseat to see what they were talking about. And that's when I saw it. To the right side, behind my mom, there appeared an object, a disc shape object. And it was hovering above, I want to say either corn or something very tall. And it was just hovering. I remember didn't have any noise, it didn't have anything but different colors, like brilliant colors, red and orange. And anyways, I remember my mom saying to Roy that that was a ufo. And then that's all I can recall. So fast forward. In 2019, I drove down to Arkansas to bring my mom up to Kansas City to see our new home. Go, chief. On the way. Coming up, she and I were listening to a creepy podcast and I brought up this incident and I said to her, hey, Mommy, do you remember? And then she said just the same story that I'm relaying to you, that she saw the ufo, but she doesn't remember, like, what happened afterwards. She just knows that picked up my stepdad and went about her business, but she doesn't recall, like, how long it took when it was anything like that. So anyways, I wanted to share this little story.

I just wanted to call about an entry I had a couple years ago. It happened when I was about six or five. It was when I was a child, but a long while ago. This at my grandma's house. And this is in a residential area, an area with a lot of buildings, just the general city area. But what's weird about this house is that it was built a long time ago. I did some digging and from what I do know, it was 1960s or 1970s, around that time. And I don't know, I always got a weird feeling from that place. There's always like pictures in that house that always kind of like stare at you. You know, the weird usual feeling you get. But this was about like believe it was in the afternoon. My dad and my grandma were just on the patio and I was in like downstairs in the basement. I heard this noise and I just kind of ignored it. I just figured it was the show because I was watching like a little creepy kid show, like Goosebumps or something, can't remember. But I heard this like dog bark and I got really scared, but I just kind of ignored it. And then I kept hearing it and it sounded like a dog, almost like barking in your ear. Like I could feel the heat on my ear. It was really weird. And when I asked my dad about it, he said he's seen like dogs outside the window before. Other people, shadow people. He has seen like the string get pulled almost as if like one of those string lights where you pull it. And what's weird is that it wasn't no pull. It was like you had to actually like grab it. And that's what I found so weird about it. So I love your show, absolutely love it.

Back in 1998, I was like 18 years old at the time. My parents live in Tennessee. Once I turned 18, I would go visit back and forth my friends in California and everything. I was young at that time. I was staying in California for a few months. I was living in a rented house with my ex boyfriend at the time. And you know, a few of our friends right before I flew over there, they had just moved into that house not that long ago. And I wasn't really on the lease.\n\n[Speaker G] But you know, that goes.\n\n[Speaker D] But I remember my ex boyfriend at the time, he was saying how he was in the bathroom, he just got a shower, he saw the handle of the door turn. He thought it was one of his daughters because he had two little girls. And he was like, stop it, stop it you guys. And he opened it up, and no one was there. And he was like, oh, wait, they're at school. So he had told me that before. Well, I didn't see anything in the house, but one afternoon, I was alone in the house. Everybody else was at work. One of my childhood friends, she lived like, five houses down, so we would hang out all the time because I grew up in that area. Anyway, so one afternoon, she walks over to the house because she's only a few houses away, and she goes, hey, do you want to come over? I'm going to go get something at my house. And I was like, sure. And I said, well, wait, I don't have a key, because remember, my name's not on the lease. And I don't really have a key to the house because whenever I would come home, it would just randomly be when I knew when people would be there. When my boyfriend was off of work or something. She goes, why don't you just leave the door unlocked? We're only going to be there for, like, two minutes. So we literally went over there for two, maybe three minutes. Top I left the door unlocked because no one else was in the house. We walked over to her house to get something real quick. Two, three minutes. Walking back is like a minute, maybe two minutes. We come back and the door is locked. And we specifically left it unlocked. We were both like, what the. No one else was home because I rang the doorbell. I'm like, well, maybe Billy came home, or maybe Suzette came home and nobody was there. We actually ended up going through a window that was unlocked. So we kind of crawled back in the window. That was weird. And it wasn't a big deal at the time, but that was kind of weird to us because we were just shaking after that. But that was just something small.

Love the show.\n\n[Speaker G] I'm from Arizona, but grew up in a small town in northern New Mexico. I've always had very intense dreams and nightmares. I can actually remember my first nightmare when I was three years old.\n\n[Speaker D] So much so that at a very.\n\n[Speaker G] Young age I taught myself how to lucid dream as well as how to wake myself up from nightmares and bad dreams that I cannot control. My grandmother died when I was 10 years old. It was really hard on me because like most 10 year olds, I loved my grandmother and it was the first death I had ever experienced. I have only happy memories of my grandmother as a child. Two days after she died, I dreamt that I was at her funeral. Everything was exactly, exactly the same as it was at her funeral. Just like two days prior. I was sitting in a chair and bent over with my face in my hands, crying in my lap. Then I look up to my right and see my grandmother sitting next to me. She was facing forward, but peering down at me from the corner of her eye. She looked angry and annoyed. It didn't feel good. It wasn't happy. It was a very scary dream. Two years later, we moved to an apartment in Arizona. I was 12 years old and I was taking a shower. I closed my eyes to rinse my hair out and in my mind's eye I suddenly had a vision of this old scary lady wearing all black with white hair and red eyes. And she was flying toward me. She was charging me. It scared the living out of me. It was my grandmother. Later in life I learned that the grandmother I loved so much had a hard life and she was abusive toward her children. She abandoned them and my grandfather when they were teenagers for a pilot and traveled around the world with him. She also struggled with alcoholism. These were family secrets that for some reason my aunt decided to tell me when I was 18. Anyway, she has visited me in my dreams once since then. I walked into a Circle K, which is a convenience store. She was working there. I knew she was my grandmother, but she didn't know who I was. I just stopped to chat with her. I cannot remember what we spoke about. I like to think that because this wasn't absolutely terrifying that she was doing okay. Later on, I told my mother about that dream and she told me my grandmother had worked at a Circle K before I was born. So I've been meditating for 22 years. I've done all kinds of different meditations, from guided to mindfulness to working with chakras and energy. Now I'm a total agnostic and skeptic. I don't necessarily wholeheartedly believe in energy or chakras or Celtic goddesses or wicked spells and rituals, but I definitely believe in the intention behind them. Also, it's Just fun to play around with what your mind is capable of doing. So I've been meditating off and on since I was 18. Sometimes I'll go six months of daily meditation and other times I won't meditate for weeks. But it's something I've always come back to. During the time these two encounters happened, I was meditating intensely every day. For the first encounter, I was doing these guided hypnosis meditations every morning upon awakening in an attempt to experience astral travel or an outer body experience. Let me preface this by saying that although I believe in a multiverse or possibly believe in it and parallel universes because, well, physics, I'm not sure if what I experienced was astral travel or that I made my mind do something strange. So after about a month or so of doing this daily meditation, I finally was able to, quote astral travel, unquote. I'm going to call back with that experience because it's too long. But long story short, I left my body and traveled through this tunnel of light to a different planet and was in what seemed like a military medical field facility with a man who tried to grab me from behind. I was able to fly and go.\n\n[Speaker D] Through walls at will.\n\n[Speaker G] I had complete control. And I know I wasn't lucid dreaming, but it wasn't too dissimilar from that. The whole time I knew I was awake. It was crazy. Now, around this time, I'm also doing a lot of guided meditations where I'm meeting various goddesses once again. I don't necessarily believe in gods or goddesses, but I believe in the intention behind them. Oh, my God. I'm so glad I'm anonymous and none of you know my name. I sound like I own a metaphysical bookstore. Anyway, they helped me to understand myself and the world around me at the time. Skepticism and spirituality can both simultaneously exist. One night I'm meditating on my bed and I completely opened myself up for any of the goddesses I had previously got to know via meditation to come and visit me. I completely opened myself up. That was a mistake. After about 20 minutes of mindful meditating and focusing on my third eye, I suddenly feel someone at my bedroom door. The hairs on the back of my neck stood straight on end. I listened to, read about and watch a lot of paranormal stuff. And I never knew what people meant when they say they feel a presence until this moment. This isn't what I was expecting, nor was it what I asked for. I feel this presence go from my bedroom door and to the foot of my bed, where my feet were. It went around my feet to the other side of my bed where I felt a hand on my right shin as if to say, I'm here. Then boom. In my mind's eye, I see a face of an old woman. It was as if her forehead was against my forehead, but I could see her whole face. Her face was really wrinkled and she had an olive complexion with dark circles around her eyes. I mean, she looked like decrepit, like she was really, really old. If I saw her in a crowd of a million people, I would be able to point her out. I immediately opened my eyes. I could have sworn this old woman would be sitting there right in front of me. She wasn't. Now, the feelings that this woman gave off weren't necessarily bad. They felt kind of good and somewhat supportive, just like lukewarm. They didn't feel evil or bad. Like when I saw my grandmother, it could have been just the meditative state I was in and that I was calm, but I don't know. And she kind of looked like my great grandmother who died 30 years before I was born. I don't know, she just looked really old and not like really happy. I'm still not sure who she was or what she wanted. It scared me so much. I didn't meditate for months and didn't get back into it for a whole year. It's the longest time I've gone without meditation. I didn't even allow myself to think about it. Just completely blocked it out. Sometimes I wonder if I had just opened myself up enough with month long intense daily meditation to be able to and receive people who have passed. Or maybe I've always had that ability with the dreams and visions of my grandmother and the dreams of my grandfather. Oh yeah, he's come to visit me multiple times in my dreams too. I don't know, but I'm not sure I'm willing to find out again. Who knows, maybe I'll be brave enough one day. If there is anyone out there who has experienced visions, visitations, or dreams of dead people, please let me know. And if anyone out there knows anything about meditation or what I experienced by just random people popping up in your face and scaring you, it would be cool to hear your thoughts. What was weird about it is like when I go into sleep paralysis, my body will start to vibrate and it's terrifying. And sleep paralysis. And this time my body started to vibrate, but I knew I was awake. I knew what was happening, I knew what was going on. And it didn't feel terrifying, but it was the same feeling. Maybe it was my body releasing dmt, like when you die. I don't know if that's even possible. I didn't see any other weird beings that people typically see when they do dmt. I don't know. I have no idea. This whole astral travel thing, out of body experiences, I don't know what it is.

It's about 9:00pm on March 30th. So I'm a manager in a restaurant downtown Cleveland, talking to a cook towards the end of shift tonight out back in an alley. After we're done talking, he calls to his girl who's waiting for him in a car nearby and says, hey, would you go look at these lights that are up in the sky? They're crazy. And I go out and I look, and sure enough, there's three lights in a triangle pattern through a slightly overcast sky. And we're looking at them, and we're all kind of tripping out at them. And then the light at the point just blinks out. And then after 30 seconds, it comes back and we're all like, whoa. And all three of us at the same time break out our phones and start recording. After a minute of recording these and seeing a larger, brighter light a little bit to, I would say, the west of the first three lights, we record for about a minute. And all these lights are just, like, hanging out. The bigger ones are kind of fading in and out. And then I noticed that my camera stops recording. Then my cook's friend says her phone stopped recording. The cook said, oh, man, mine did, too. And we all start digging through our phones, and all three of the recordings are missing. It's as if we never recorded anything. And the lights are still in the sky. And as of right now, I was just out there. Again, this happened about half an hour ago, and I was just out there about five minutes ago, and they're still up in the sky. There you go. Love your show, Derek. That was really freaking weird. Have a good night.\n\n[Speaker B] Thank you, jp. Well, that's kind of unusual. It would be one thing if the camera malfunctioned and suddenly stopped the recording. After all, phones do weird things. They're awfully glitchy. I know mine is all the time. But it wasn't just one phone. In fact, it was three. And all three seemed to shut down at the same time, which to me suggests that whatever these lights were, they deplored some sort of scrambling or jamming of the signal that rendered the phone useless. Now, a quick Google search didn't directly explain how such a thing could have even happened. According to much of what I read, a total blocking of the camera and microphone functions would require technology that simply does not exist. Which tells me it either was all a big coincidence, or this power does exist, and it's reserved for certain government operations. I suppose it's possible that invaders from another time, plane or planet might have that ability as well. And. And if they wanted to stay undetected, they could implement this jamming mechanism to keep from showing up on any unwanted videos. But as a self described rational thinker, I can't help but wonder this if they wanted to stay undetected and go unnoticed, then why the hell would they put bright lights on each corner of the craft?

I just randomly had this memory of being very little and my mom taking me out of the house to the end of the walkway. And there's a bunch of people all over the streets and on our property looking for something. I remember a really low helicopter that was really loud and my mom was crying like hysterically. My memory is that I was just really scared. I thought I did something wrong and so I started crying. That was into my memory. So when that memory came to me as a teenager, I asked my parents, like, what was that about? And my mom said that it was On Mother's Day, 1989, when I was like two and a half years old. I went missing from my home. The police were called. A neighborhood search party ensued. The police search helicopter was launched. My dad raced down to the wash to investigate. One of the neighbors said that they saw a couple adults and a kid down there by the wash. He went there, found the people. It was just like a couple people and a kid exploring. The police came to the house and searched like the complete police Protopolis search. I guess you're not supposed to just search with your eyes, but also with your hands. So they, like, put their hands on the bed and, you know, flung their hands out, like, touching the whole surface of the bed just to make sure there's nothing under the covers. They knelt down, looked under the bed, searched every crevice of the house, as police officers are trained to do when they're searching for a missing child. So a couple hours, two hours go by, they cannot find me. My mom is just hysterical. She's mentally fatigued. And so she goes to lay my sister down in her crib, which is in my same bedroom. And my mom sees my little feet poking out from under a blanket on the bed that was neatly made. So this blanket was covering my whole body except my two little feet. I've never slept like that before. The police searched that bed. She watched. The police officers searched the bed. She remembers the police officer's name, like, Officer Star. So my mom grabbed me out of the bed, and then that's when my memory starts. She runs outside to show the helicopters and everybody in the neighborhood that I had been found. So I asked them. I'm like, where was I? And she doesn't know. My dad also remembers the whole event. They do not remember where I was. My mom thought it was weird because the police officer, he must have been new and didn't know what to say, but he was like, maybe she was walking around outside by herself. And it's Mother's Day. Maybe a mom picked her up and took her for ice cream. I think it was just a weird thing that he didn't really think through. Just trying to calm an extremely scared mom. But, yeah, my parents definitely remember. I remember it. No one knows where I was. That's creepy. So I'm kind of wondering what your ideas could be, because I can't think of any.

While it's on my mind. This is a strange glitch story. I was driving down to my parents house which is in East Texas. I was on a road I'd driven dozens of times. You know was going down there monthly for a while. It was on Loop 7 near Athens, Texas. I had to turn off on Highway 19 again. I'd driven this way dozens of times, probably could have practically done it with my eyes closed. But anyway, as I was driving along I look for my landmark which is a hospital that sits over on the left hand side of the highway. And it stands out quite a bit because the helicopter pad is out Front and oftentimes the helicopter is sitting there, so it's quite eye catching. So I'm driving along and I knew I was getting close to my exit, so I was kind of just watching for that. There's not a whole lot out there, a lot of country, rolling farmland, that kind of thing. So all of a sudden I realize I'm passing the hospital, but it's on my right. I'm on the wrong side of the road. Now, it is a loop, but in order for me to be going in the wrong direction, I would have had to have turned off at some point and literally got back on it. You know, driving in the wrong direction, which I had not done. I know where I'm going on that road. Very familiar with it. I wasn't distracted, wasn't talking on the phone. I was just probably listening to a podcast or something on the radio. I was so flustered by the whole thing, I had to literally pull over because I did not know how all of a sudden I was driving the wrong way on the very familiar road. Still don't have an explanation for that one at all. My other odd glitch story is I was sitting at McDonald's waiting for my food. They'd asked me to pull up a little bit and wait for my food. So I was. There was a lady that had parked nearby and got out of her car and she walked in front of me. It caught my eye because she had long, pretty hair and she was carrying a cup of something and she was scrounging through her purse and I thought, oh God, she's going to drop whatever that is, because it was kind of precariously balanced. So I was just kind of watching her, just waiting for her to drop this big cup of whatever it was as she's scrounging around through her purse. And she walked right in front of me as if she was going into the McDonald's there. You know, she walked on by and I just turned my attention back to just kind of sitting there waiting. And just within 10 or 15 seconds, I would say a movement over to my right caught my eye and I looked over and it's the same lady. She did the same thing, walked in front of me, you know, this big cup of whatever about to spill, scrounging around through her bag. And exact same thing that had just happened now, I guess, you know, I thought, well, did she walk around and go through the building and come out behind me? But there had not been time. We're talking maybe 10 or 15 seconds and she would have had to run around the building and come out there again and again. It was the exact same movement, the exact same scrounging through her purse, almost dropping the cup of whatever. It was very bizarre. It was like take two. But anyway, I just wanted to share those quick stories. Can't explain either one of them. Anyway, thanks for all you do. Have a good day.

My call comes from a shop I used to work at. Anybody from Michigan knows where Lapeer is? It's further east of Lapeer in a little town called Capac. This shop is kind of in the woods, a little bit surrounded by cornfields. There's woods on the back side of it and it's got four buildings. And I've noticed whenever I started working there, I started on night shift. And I noticed that I always got a weird feeling in that shop. And I started noticing whenever I worked in the fourth building, which is over more into the woods, I would hear noises. One time I heard a woman coughing when I was the only one in the whole building. It was like right in my ear. I've noticed shadows around the corners of the machines too. Solid black shadows, kind of peeping around. Almost kind of like a hide behind. Then I was talking to a guy I work with and he said that one time he heard his name being called in the woods and he said there was a windigo and he left a tobacco offering like you're supposed to. And he hasn't had any issues with it since then. I brushed him off. So that's nonsense. You know, I believe in the paranormal stuff, but that's a little too far fetched for me. But whenever I told him that, I started seeing a lot more shadows. I don't know if it was a windigo so much as the woods were more haunted. I'm not 100 sure, but I do know that I always felt like I was being watched. And I felt like it was some kind of old restless spirit in the woods trying to play tricks on me.

So my story is this. I was riding a bus one day and there was this guy in front of me. He asked me for a pen and I had a pen on me. I don't know why. And so I give him the pen and he starts writing a piece of paper. He turns around and he starts explaining to me what all these symbols mean on a piece of paper. And I'm like looking at him and I'm kind of figuring out what's going on. He's saying, oh, this is infinity. This is nothing. And they're like all over the piece of paper. One that has like a circle and a line through it. One has like little holes punched through the paper and they're all randomly all throughout the paper. Oh, and the guy just looked really normal. He seemed a little skittish. He looked kind of frightened, but you know he was really clean. He was kind of young, like in his 20s. And he's dressed pretty normal, but just, like I said, kind of skittish. So I asked him, I'm like, what shows you this? Then he told me a thing, showed him this. So I was like, okay. And I'm like, was this thing good? Then he kind of shakes his head kind of weird, the way he shook his head kind of, like, really fast. I don't know, just kind of like jerky. And so we had been stopped at a stop for a while, and he hadn't gone off yet, and all of a sudden, out of nowhere, he just gets off. And I kind of wonder if he left this thing with me or left something with me, if that's why he got off so quickly, because it just seemed really odd that he get off that fast. And so I asked my friend, this guy I know who's really into, like, subtle energies and really clairvoyant and knows about this kind of stuff. I start telling about this, and before I even finish explaining what happened, he says, oh, he started saying this means this. This means this. And I'm like, yes. And so he does this thing where he kind of goes into his zone, and I close my eyes and he kind of sees what's going on, and he tells me that I was exposed to dark forces. He got rid of it, whatever it was, but I just thought it was kind of crazy. I remember kind of like feeling a little bit more irritable than normal after this happened. And then, you know.

So when I was about 8, I was walking around my neighborhood in spring or summer. This was about 12 or 13 years ago. It was warm and the sun was just starting to set. I live in the suburbs of Southern California, but we have a lot of, like, open space and trees around where I live, at least at the time that this happened. Unfortunately, a lot of it has since been destroyed. So there's one big stretch of city property, I guess along sort of a back row of houses near us. And it was covered in a bunch of, like, the tall native grass from the open space sort of grasslands. And it was shaded by this huge, beautiful oak tree, which I loved as a kid. So as I walked past, I was watching all these little insects darting around in the grass, sort of glowing with, like, the sunset. It was really beautiful. And my eyes fell to, like, one figure in particular. It was larger than the small flies, but not by a ton. It was only maybe an inch or two in height, and it was clearly humanoid, but it looked very thin and spindly, sort of like it was made of twigs. I remember seeing very humanoid legs in particular. And I don't remember what the face looked like or if I even could make out details of it at the time, but I think it had wings. It was bouncing between a few blades of grass. And I somehow felt like it was dancing for me or that it was letting me see. Like, I could tell that this thing was aware of me and it was sort of giving me permission to see. Looked a lot like. There's this video that is very clearly fake. But I thought after this experience and was shocked by how similar it looked. It's called on YouTube, like, Creepy Fairy UK or something. It's a figure very much like what I described, which, again, I saw this video after this experience and it freaks me out because of how similar. Anyways, so I crouched down and I was watching this thing for a few minutes, and it very weirdly didn't feel shocking to me. It was exciting, but I wasn't freaking out. It felt very natural, like if I was looking at a squirrel or a bird. And this is coming from someone who loves fairies, like any kid, especially kids raised as girls, we love fairies. And I was very creative and I had a great imagination, but that's never bled into what I knew to be real. I could always tell the difference between that and I never had any other experience like this. Until a few years ago, it was very strange to me and I've heard a few times from other people with strange experiences. That feeling of it doesn't feel shocking or scary like it should, even though it's very clearly out of the ordinary. Anyway, that stretch of grass has unfortunately since been converted into turf, and a lot of the trees in our neighborhood are cut down. But sometimes I still, when I'm walking through, have that same feeling when I saw it. I don't really know how to describe what that is exactly, but I'm very grateful to have had that experience. It pushed me into further obsession with the fae and eventually into paganism. I don't know, just curious if anyone had any similar experiences.

Me and my cousin, he's a park ranger at Lake Warren State park and it was a summer night, so it was probably 70 something. Maybe a little hotter than that. Anyways, at the park there's a dock that leads to the lake and it goes out pretty far in the lake. Like, 10, 15ft out. And usually we go out there and we kind of just talk and stargaze and just talk about life, really. And we were out there one night, and we were just doing our normal thing, talking, sharing stories. And the middle of the lake, I saw this light, like, underwater. And I told my cousin, I was like, hey, do you see that light there? He's like, yeah, but it's probably just the road, because there's, like, a dam, if you will, to the right side of us, and cars pass all the time, back and forth. And he was like, yeah, it's just a reflection of somebody passing. And I was like, dude, there's no cars because you could hear the car over the lake because the lake echoes. And he was like, you know what? You're right. So we're looking. All of a sudden, the light just starts moving back and forth, almost like a pinball machine. Like, it's going back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. So I'm like, well, water reflects light. So I look up, and there it was. It was this huge white light. I thought it was the moon the whole time. It was that bright. And I'm looking, and I'm like, what in the world? I kind of hit my cousin on the arm to look up, and as soon as he looks up, it drops down a little bit closer to us, and then it just gone. And it had this weirdest sound. I can't replicate it, but on the water, you could see the ripples of, I guess, like, air kind of hit the water. And you know how, like, a speedboat is on the water. It kind of moves the water. It was almost like that. So then I pull my flashlight out, and I'm looking around the water. And the most scariest thing that night was all the alligators looking at us. And just right there at the dock. That was more scary than what I was looking at. Yeah, that was just the craziest thing. I remember after it left, it was like all the sound came back. The owls, the crickets. I didn't realize at the time, like, it was just silent. But when it left, everything was just boastful loud. It was just like. It came back. It was like, the weirdest thing.

I was just listening to the 13.5 episode of season eight. It had a lot of disembodied voices stories. I wanted to tell you the story of what happened to me one time. Where I live, it's a trailer park between a couple cornfields in middle Indiana. My friends whom I live with, they take care of the stray cats. They will catch them, vet them, fix them, and then release them back into the trailer park. Anyways, I was at home and me and my daughter were just watching TV and I hear a commotion outside, sounding like a couple of kids up to no good were chasing and harassing the stray cats. So I jump up off the couch and my daughter, she starts asking, what are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing? Don't, don't, don't. And I just like shush the kids. They're chasing the cats and you know how the cats get. So I bust out of the door trying to scare these kids, trying to tell them, you know, hey, leave these cats alone. They're not doing anything to you. Leave them alone. And there's no kids. There's no kids out on the road. There's one cat just sitting on the porch and this cat, we call him Socks, he's just sitting there looking at me. And as I'm putting this into my head, my daughter, she is physically grabbing me from around the collar of my shirt and dragging me back inside saying, what are you doing? What are you doing? Get back inside, get back inside. And I didn't know why she was manhandling me like this. My 15 year old daughter manhandling me back inside. And she slams the door shut. I'm like, what are you doing? Why did you do that? I was trying to make sure the cats were okay. And she's like, no. I heard you outside saying very clearly, come here, come here. And you popped up and ran outside. And I said, that's not what I heard. I heard A couple of kids chasing and yelling and screaming outside like kids will heal. And then it hits in my mind that this obviously feral cat that only likes like one or two people was just calmly sitting on our porch after I busted like the Kool Aid man through our front door. And it really rubbed me the wrong way that he never sits still like that. I've seen him around that house for two years now. He never sits still like that. To this day, I tell my friends, I'm like, don't let that cat inside. Do not let that cat inside. He gives me the crates. There's just something wrong about him. I don't know what it was. There's a lot of things that go on at that trailer park. Just weird, weird things. But that was one of my weird ones. I've been wanting to tell this story for a while.

On February 29th of 2024, an email went out to our neighborhood saying that there had been a robbery on a street close by. The burglars had come in through the second story and had disabled the Alarm, et cetera, et cetera. The email was just to say, be careful. This has happened. So that came through my consciousness on the afternoon of February 29th. That evening I had been experiencing some back pain, and I thought maybe it was because of my mattress. My son is in college and so his room is free, and I thought, oh, I'll just sleep in there, you know, to see if a different mattress would make the pain go away. So I was not in my usual bed. I fell asleep normally, and at some point in the early morning, I woke myself up, as I occasionally do. I'll say this happens about every, you know, three or four months. I woke myself up with a recurring nightmare. The plot's always the same. The antagonist is always the same. Those details don't really matter. But I do always wake myself up from these dreams in an attempt to scream. I will be screaming, but my lips are closed, so there is sound that comes out, but it's not a full scream. The feeling of it is similar to, like a sleep paralysis kind of thing. It's happened so many times now that I'm fully aware of what it is when it's happening. And so I'm having this experience and I'm waking myself up with the scream, and I look to the left of my son's bed and there is a person standing there. I don't see the face. I just see, like, what you would see at bed level. I can see the torso and the beginnings of the legs. And I immediately think, oh, it's my husband who has heard this scream. He's also familiar with it. Helps me every time it happens, it will wake him up too. And I thought, oh, he's heard it from his room and he's come in to help me. And then I realized what I'm looking at is definitely not my husband. And your mind works so fast in situations like that. I immediately thought of the robbery, which I hadn't given any more thought to. And then I quickly thought, well, that doesn't make sense. Like, why the robber would come around to this side of the bed. And none of it makes any sense. And I reach my arm out into the space because the presence is so real, I can see it so clearly. And of course there's no one there. My hand just touches empty air. At that point, I just went back to sleep. I wasn't scared at all. I just thought, wasn't it that interesting? And I went back to sleep. This is on Thursday night, early Friday morning, in the middle of the night on Saturday, just Following that, the very next Saturday, I had a retreat with some girlfriends of mine. And we did these fairly often. And we focus in that we have a leader and we focus in this retreats on generating positive energy and love and heart centered presence and emotions. And it's a really lovely group of people. It almost feels like a religious experience. And after the intro that the guide, you know, leads us on, then we have a period of silence where we just drop in and concentrate on our breathing and see what happens. I hadn't given this dream any thought. I hadn't given the robbery any thought. I certainly had not given what, what I perceive to be a being standing beside my bed any thought since it happened on Thursday night, Saturday. As I'm lying in this silent retreat and trying to think of things and people that make me feel good, I had a series of thoughts that led really randomly but very definitively to the realization this is out of nowhere, that the being in my room on Thursday night, two nights prior was someone that I had known in high school. Now I'm 51 years old, so this is 30 years ago that I would have seen this person. And by the way, I didn't know him very well at all. He was a little bit older, had an apartment, was in college in our town. And we used to hang out in his apartment and party with him. And I thought he was very cute. I had a crush on him. I remember at one point he kissed me in the hallway. There was definitely a chemistry and a spark there between the two of us, but I didn't give it any thought past like 1991. I didn't see him, I didn't think about it. So to have this awareness that this being in my room was this person was completely out of nowhere. I was pretty stunned by it. This person, his name was Hugh. He had also had a tragic and very mysterious death in his early adulthood. So there was definitely the understanding and awareness that it was his ghost in my room. So we went on with the retreat and it was all great and I was still processing. And when I came home and discussed it with my husband the next day, I was saying to him, this is so weird. Like I just am 100% sure that's who was in my room when I was having this nightmare. And I said to my husband, I'm going to look him up, I'm going to see if I can find a photograph online. You know, it was 1991 the last time I saw him. And I could not find a photograph to remind me of what he really had looked like. But I did find his obituary and I was absolutely stunned that he had died on March 1. I don't know the year, it was probably the late 90s, and he was definitely in my room on March 1, 2024, in the early, early hours of the day. He was a professional scuba diver and had died exploring an unknown new cave system in the Bahamas. Like super deep in the water. So he was basically lost at sea is what they would say about a death like that. I was sad when I had heard it happen, but I did think, wow, like, what a crazy way to go, first of all, and what a brave person to be doing that in the first place. But when the matchup came with the date that I saw him in my room and his passing, I could not believe it. Now, a skeptic would say that's a 1 in 365 chance. Of course, this is a leap year, so it's 1 in 366. But when you factor in the fact that this person had not crossed my mind in 30 years, and you think about all the people that come and go in your life in 30 year span, to be that sure that that's who it was is really weird. And I love, love, love the podcast and listening to everyone's experience, because when this happens to you, there's not a shred of doubt about what it is that you're experiencing. Experiencing that it's real. The question is, why is it happening and what is the point? What is the purpose of it? Why would he be standing there? As these past months have come and gone and I've thought about it every single day and wondered. I can only say that there had been a connection between us when we were young. I'm impressed with anybody that's willing to do that type of thing, that take that kind of risk and really pursue their passion. And of course it's always sad when tragedy strikes like that, but I really am inspired by people like that. I'm also very passionate about the deep ocean. And so the purpose of his life is meaningful to me. And the fact that he would have appeared to me during this nightmare, just be standing right there beside me, makes me really know in my heart that he's a protecting energy and a benevolent force to be there with me. And I just wanted to share this story because it has been so meaningful to me as I've processed it. Even though it's a person that's kind of random in a 51 year life to have just pop up like that and, and you just never know, do you? And I love your encouragement that we all stay open to these things because that is when they start happening more and more often and certainly with, you know, more convincingly.

And listening to that girl who was talking about Shadow People. And it reminded me of a situation that I experienced. I'll try to make a long story short. I never experienced anything like Bigfoot or UFOs or ghosts or stuff like that, even though living in, like, prime areas for that type of activity. Born on the northern coast of California and never saw or smelled or heard Bigfoot while living there. And then moved to the Sierra Nevadas in the Lake Tahoe area where the house I grew up in as a kid was backed up against National Forest. We had miles of woods behind us. And now live in a very rural town in the Sierras in California with, you know, about 120 people and still have yet to experience anything. One of the places that my wife and kids and I like to visit is the Eureka Dunes in the northern end of Death Valley. And it's pretty up there. There's no people. It's very remote. The sand dunes are there. And we usually go in the spring or the fall, and the kids can play on the dunes. And it's always warm and not too cold at night. It's just very remote. It's a very pretty place. And also the dunes out there, they sing something about the dry sand on top of wet sand. It makes a humming noise. When the temperature's right and the wind is blowing, it, like, reverberates through the dunes. You'll be sitting out there during the day and you'll get sounds like a distant airplane, but it's really the dunes vibrating. But whenever we go camping at the dunes, we've been there maybe a dozen times. For me, as soon as the sun kind of sets, kind of this eerie feeling, this uncomfortable feeling that, you know, you shouldn't be there. It's. The area's too open or too exposed. This is something that sinks in my stomach and will last throughout the night until, you know, morning. I don't say anything because I know that if I say something like, well, I'm uneasy I'm uncomfortable or not feeling great, then my wife's gonna be uneasy and uncomfortable. And if she's uneasy and uncomfortable, the kids are uneasy and no one's having a good time. So usually I just kind of push it deep down inside and try not to think about it. But there's this feeling there that as soon as that sun sets, there's just something wrong. After spending so many years in that country and backpacking in remote areas, I don't feel that anywhere else. Only in this location at these dunes. And the last time we were out there, we're there and it's close to a full moon. The nights were extremely bright. And if you've ever experienced a full moon in the desert where there's no trees and very little ground cover, it's just something different than experiencing that where there's light pollution or there's, you know, heavy forest, everything is whitewashed, everything's just blinded. White shadows and objects are very crisp and defined. So we're there and, you know, darkness falls and that same uneasy feeling comes back. So eventually go to bed, get in the camper and fall asleep. And I remember having this dream where I'm with, you know, the family and we're just standing and off in the distance is this shadowy figure and this just feeling of unease and being uncomfortable and this uncontrollable urge to confront that. And in the dream, I end up running straight towards that shadowy black blob. And, you know, it's dreams day, so everything seems super fast and super slow at the same time. But I'm running towards this object because I feel like I need to get to it. And as soon as I reach it, I wake up and I'm shaky and cold and it felt like a nightmare, but it wasn't a nightmare. And I'm, you know, laying there trying to figure out what that meant and to calm myself down. And I have to pee. So I figured now is a good time. I'm already awake. I'm going to crawl out of camper and go pee. So I make my way and go outside and the moon is out and it's super bright. You can see the dunes and the surrounding mountains. And as I'm peeing, I'm kind of just looking out at everything, still a little uneasy and shaky from the dream. And just that general feeling of uncomfortable. Something's wrong. And as I'm staring out in front of me, there is this shadowy blob like, I don't know, two, 300 yards away from me. And I'M looking at it, trying to figure out what it is. The bushes out there are very spindly and kind of wiry. You can easily tell because light will shine through them easily, and they look like a bush. And this wasn't. This was darker, denser. Just this silhouette. I'm looking at it. That same uncontrollable urge to, you know, chase after that and confront it and run towards it to figure out what is going on, what it is. I'm trying to suppress that urge. And it took a lot for me to calm down and just slowly back away and get back into the camper, you know, after that, it's just a really kind of rough night of being kind of on edge and uneasy and nervous and eventually fell back asleep. And, you know, the next morning everything was fine. The feeling's gone. I told my wife about the dream, but I didn't tell her about what happened outside. So that was what now, two years ago. And during that time, and this is what struck a chord with my situation in the caller, there's a religious aspect. At that time, my wife and I were trying to get out of a religion that was unhealthy for us. And I don't know if there's a correlation. Maybe it's all psychological to confront, I don't know. But it seemed to resonate with me, and I figured out a good time to share if someone else has experienced something similar. Anyways, we're planning to go back to the dunes, and, I mean, I'm sure the feeling won't be there. I don't know, it's just weird. Appreciate the podcast. I really enjoy it.

So I've been listening to your podcast for a little while. I've heard people talking about shadow people. I'm guessing that's what I seen, but I'm not too sure. Anyways, this was probably 20 years. 02 04. Had to be 4 and I woke one night from sleeping on the couch. I just would pass out in random locations. In my house I was in a family room which was a ranch style house, two car garage but one of the garages was converted into a family room slash bar area. Remember waking up in the corner, I've seen a shadow. The ceilings, I don't know, probably were about 7 to 8ft tall. The shadow pretty much almost reached the ceiling. Nothing weird happened. I just remember waking up and looking at the wall and seeing its shadow. Like I couldn't see a face or anything. It was just a figure, maybe a man. The only reason why I say that is because he would try to talk to me one of the nights. So I used to sleep in my parents bedroom in a crib. There's a three bedroom house. My sister was in one room, my two brothers were in the other room and then I was with my parents in their room. So they used to try to talk to me but I can't remember what it was trying to say to me. All I remember feeling was really uncomfortable, just uneasy. When it would try to talk to me I would hide under the blanket and I would tell it to go away. I don't want to talk to you. Can't remember how many times it happened but there was three or four times. I can remember waking up in my parents bedroom and it trying to talk to me. It was like one of those voices, like really deep low octave, just really deep. There's another current. I think this is the last time I seen was during the snowstorm because 04 there was the really big snowstorm here. So the house was in a corner lot just in a regular neighborhood with other houses and duplexes and whatnot. But the backyard was like an L shape so there is a sliding door from the bar area, family room area and deck. And then to the right is a little tiny wood shed not that big. After the deck there was a patch of grass that extended to the far back fence. Before it would touch the street. I was back there playing in the snow. I love the snow. I don't know why. I always have. So I remember seeing it. It was on the fence and the fence was pretty tall fence, six foot, seven foot tall fence. I've seen a shadow figure. That's all I can remember. Just as a shadow figure, it was on the back. Then I tried to go back inside, but for some reason the door was locked. I couldn't get it open. Started to freak out. As I'm trying to get inside. I start banging on the door when nobody was coming. And as I'm freaking out, it starts to move towards me and slowly goes from the fence to the house. Starts going up on the house on the far side. And I'm on the complete opposite end. Slowly starts to move up on the house. Still freaking out. Gets closer, gets closer. Probably gets to about five feet away from me. And as it sat close, a sliding door open. Boom. Ransack. So I closed it and locked it and just ran away. That was the last time I think that I seen it. I remember telling my mom about it and she would tell me if it tried to talk to me, to pray to God, tell him to remove it. Tell him I don't like it. So that's what I did. After that, I didn't experience anything weird like that again. Anyways, thanks for listening to my story and good luck with the show.\n\n[Speaker D] We appreciate the call. Jacob and I wondered how long it would take for that detail to come up. One of these shadow entities trying to speak to us. For the longest time, I'd never heard of anyone mention that detail in their account. But once I pointed it out, it seemed to have opened the floodgates. But as interesting as it was that this shadow entity tried to communicate with Jacob, that detail pales in comparison to the mental image of one of these things climbing on the side of your house. Boy, I'd like to see the doorbell camera footage of that one. Either way, it was an incredible account.

Haven't always lived here. I used to live upstate in New York, and I was listening to your last show when I heard Leslie from California's story about being pulled out of bed. It immediately Brought to mind some pretty haunting memories from my childhood. Living in a house in upstate New York, which was for sure haunted. I had a bunk bed, but there was no one in the top bunk. Later on, my brother would end up sharing a room with me if he was born. But I have memories probably from. My earliest memories are from that room. I would wake up in the middle of the night and there'd be a man, large, black shadow of a man at least, standing at the foot of my bed. And he'd be laughing or smoking a cigarette. And he would pull me off my bed by my feet. Yeah, I would be screaming and crying. My parents would rush in and there'd be nobody there. So this continued for at least a full year. It was probably longer. I don't remember a lot of my childhood, but this is one of the few things I do remember. I must have been around like five years old or younger. And I would often wake up due to my head hitting the floor at the foot of my bed. Now, I don't know how a kid turns around in a twin bed, but that happened to me all the time. My parents used to joke about it. They're like, oh, yeah, we'd find your feet at your pillow and your head at the foot of the bed. They were aware that I would, like, somehow flip over in my sleep. But they also remember coming in plenty of times to hearing me screaming and crying. You know, my head would hit the floor and my feet would hit the floor, and I would look up and above me would be the shadow man, laughing at me in this dark, husky, you know, voice, you know, something really, really creepy. And then as soon as that door opened, as soon as the lights in the hallway hit the room, nothing. There was no one there. And I remember how terrified I was to go to sleep in that room. I used to also sleep talk, apparently around this time. And my sister's room was right next to mine. Would come in when she heard me, you know, up at, you know, any hour of the night. I actually remember her running in a few times after I'd been pulled off the bed head first. He would grab my head after my feet. I don't know what was going on, but she comes into the room and I'm sitting both upright in bed. She asked me what's going on? And I just laid back down and closed my eyes and whispered something. She gets really close to me to hear what I'm saying, and she's like, archer, I didn't know you're awake. What's going on and I whisper, I have to pretend to be asleep or the man will get me. So that kind of scarred her for life too. Scared the out of her. Yeah. So my parents also had some kind of haunting event in that house when they just moved in. But I'll give you another call.

That is where this story takes place. And this happened back in the early 1980s. So it was quite a while ago. After I got married to who is now my ex, we bought a house, and it was kind of Outside the town we lived in, it was on the side of a mountain. And the house was about 200 years old, so it was very small. But they had built onto it through the years like there was a bathroom off to one end. And then they virtually doubled the size of the house recently before we bought it. And we were comfortable in it. But I started having recurring dreams. They started out the same, and then they would have different endings as you went along, until eventually they became horrific nightmares. And the start of the dream would always be that I would wake up and I'd be paralyzed in bed, hearing footsteps coming up the stairs, up the hall, towards the bedroom, and I couldn't do anything about it. And the various endings became bad after there was a kidnapping in the dream, and then finally there was an axe murder. That was horrific. The weird thing about the dreams is that our stairway was carpeted. And in the dream, it was definitely steps on hardwood stairs. And it sounded like a man because it was a heavier tread. So the guy I was married to was very meat and potatoes. And he was a skeptic of anything that didn't make sense or couldn't be proven. So I never said anything until one morning we woke up, and he said, I had the strangest dream. And, honest, my blood ran cold because I just knew that the dream he had was related to mine. And it was. So in this dream, at the end, you know, you were paralyzed, and you could hear the footsteps approaching. But finally I could move. And in it, I was in a shooter stance with a pistol aimed at the bedroom doorway. His was exactly the same, except instead of a pistol, he had a rifle. We must have taken this dream seriously, because we decided that from there on out, when we were sleeping, the bedroom door had to be closed, and he loaded a rifle and put it under the bed. So after that, I only had the dream a few times. Like, he would come to bed after me and forget to shut the door. And I'd have the dream, and it would wake me up. I'd get out of bed and shut the door, and I'd be fine after that. When we first moved in the house, we had a puppy, and we just thought we got a strange dog because he would look like he was chasing on somebody's heels, going forward, prancing, backing up, pawing the air, just like you would if he was playing with somebody. And we didn't think anything about it until we started hearing the footsteps upstairs. They would usually occur when we're downstairs later at night, and you'd hear the heel, toe, heel, toe. In the hallway outside the bedroom where we had the dreams, same area. He would go storming upstairs and of course nobody would ever be there. So I was thinking, okay, we got a ghost. But I never said anything until one night our dog went to bed before us. He went up to the master bedroom and all of a sudden we heard this racket where it sounded like he was trying to run on the hardwood. And a huge crash. So my ex gets up off the couch and declares, that damn ghost is after my dog. And he goes storming up. He did find that the bedroom door was shut and our dog was cowering in the corner. He was shivering. So we don't know what happened, but something scared our dog. The thing about the ghost was that it wasn't always there, but you could tell when it was there. There was a difference in the energy. And it was especially bad, like in the winter when I would come home first and you could just walk in and feel the energy in the house was different. And you could hear him walking around in the old part of the house. And the dog and I would just sit at the kitchen table until either my ex came home or the ghost would go away. So maybe it was that reason we didn't tell people about. Did affect people, though. Like one time my ex was on a hunting trip and I had my cousin come down and stay with me. And I was doing something in the kitchen and I came back into the living room and she was sitting on the couch, white as a ghost. And she said, who's upstairs? And yep, you could hear him walking around. And I had to tell her we had a ghost. And I tried to comfort her by saying that the bedroom that we were going to sleep in was safe because it was a newer part of the house. Then we actually had four people that saw the ghost. I never did, but I had two cousins stay over and a couple from college at different times. And the area that we would use as a guest room, it was a big hall at the top of the stairs, which ironically is where we heard the footsteps, but that's where we kept the fold out couch. And they all saw the same thing. Like they'd wake up in the middle of the night and there would be a man walking back and forth at the foot of their bed who they would think first would be my ex. But then they realized that the man was older and he had silver hair and they were too scared to do anything or call out. So eventually it would just disappear. So the marriage wasn't working. So we separated. I got an apartment, and for a while I would come home and we tried to work it out. One of the final times when I got into my apartment, I got a call from him saying that he went back in the house after I drove away, and there was all this racket upstairs in the bedroom. And he went upstairs and every picture of me was face down on the bed bureau, like something had come in and just knocked him over, which made me think I was the problem. And apparently it was because he did get remarried and they stayed in the house for a little bit and we were on good terms. So I would have to call once in a while with questions about taxes or something. I'd say, so how's the ghost? Have you heard him? Have you seen him? And the answer was always no. And I took it to mean that I was a paranormal magnet, which turns out I am. The house is still there. I don't get up in the Poconos very much, but when I do, when I'm in that area, I'll, like, drive by and I'll think, what is going on in that house? So that's my story. And thank you very much for listening.

My name is Megan and I'm calling from Detroit, Michigan, and I wanted to share a little bit about my paranormal experience. It was about 10 years ago and I was at my family's home with my parents and I'd recently gotten like really into the paranormal. And apart from watching things on TV and I know me and my friends sometimes would mess around with the Ouija board, I never really Understood kind of the dangers of potentially what could happen with using those paranormal tools. So I wanted to try to get a little bit deeper into it. I was learning about spirit guides and potentially communicating with spirits. So I had bought a book and it gave exercises on how to communicate with the spirit world. And I remember reading it right before bed and I was like, you know, trying to meditate and I was trying to connect with my spirit guide. And I just said, you know, I really want to try to connect with my spirit guide. And I kind of like said that as a meditation and prayer to myself. Closed the book and then went to bed, turned off the light. And then sometime during the night, I'm a pretty sound sleeper, but I woke up and you can imagine, you know, it's a pitch black room, but I opened my eyes to see what now I can only imagine to be a shadow person. So in the darkness of my room, I still see the outline of a person about 5ft tall. But what distinguished it from the night was it was darker than the dark of my room. And I was so startled and that even within the blink of my eye, me kind of gasping and screaming, like I let out an audible scream, it was gone. And I remember just being so freaked out, I went back to sleep. But just in the morning, like I couldn't believe what I had actually saw and that it actually occurred the previous night. So I was pretty freaked out. So I didn't use the book anymore. I really kind of distanced myself from using the Ouija. And then now on TV you see so much more about the paranormal clips and videos. And that's how I later learned that it was most likely a shadow person. I've never seen it again, but I think that that really opened my eyes to like the potential dangers of shadow people and me thinking, what did I potentially unleash into my parents home? So I definitely got rid of that book. No longer played around with the Ouija just because it was such a profound experience. So I just want to caution those out there who are potentially using anything like that or want to communicate with forces beyond them or spirits that sometimes it's just better to leave those aside just for your own safety. But it was definitely something that spooky that happened to me and I wanted to share it with the podcast. So thank you so much. Love the podcast and keep it spooky.

I'm currently in north central Kentucky, and this story takes place in New Orleans. I lived there for 20 years, and obviously New Orleans is very haunted. She's her own entity. This city lives and breathes. When I got there in 2000, I experienced certain things catching things out of the corner of my eye, hearing voices, but especially I feel the energy around me. You know, when I walk into somebody's house, I say, whoa, you got a loud house. Or, oh, wow, your house is kind of quiet. And I worked in the French Quarter mostly as a doorman at a bar at a couple different bars. And this couple would show up every once in a while. Let's call them Gracie and Joe, because I want to keep their identities a secret just in case. Gracie and Joe were kind of a weird dyad. Gracie was bubbly and outgoing, and she always wanted to have fun and meet new people. And Joe would kind of lurk in the background. You know, he was really quiet, and he kind of came off a little bit jealous. I didn't know too much about them, but over the years, I got to know them. And I kept in touch with Gracie because she was active on her Facebook. He didn't have one. And I was visiting my mother in Tampa, Florida, on Thanksgiving in 2019, and I saw the Facebook post. She had announced that her husband Joe had passed away. I immediately contacted her and said, hey, look, if you need any help, let me know. Boy, how did she call me back? Fast. She didn't know what to do because she was married at 16 to Joe, and he basically took care of everything. He expected her just to be at the house and, you know, taking care of this, taking care of dinner, and blah, blah, blah. So she really didn't know what to do. I gave her a little bit of advice and told her I'd be on my way to New Orleans from Tampa. That was my plan. Anyway, when I got to New Orleans and I went to her house, walked in her house, and it felt like sunshine when I walked in the house. She had several cats, and she was doing quite well for herself. I had just happened to show up, and I was there for a couple weeks. I was hanging out with her. We were having fun. We were reminiscing and watching TV together and stuff like that. And we were drinking beer and drinking rum. Her favorite was rum. And a couple days later, I walked into the house after a day of work, and I walked in, I said, whoa, the energy here has absolutely changed. This is a very loud house now, and it's very dark. And I said, whoa, what is the difference? And she cheerfully came up and said that Joe's ashes had arrived today. She had him cremated, and his urn was delivered that day. And I didn't say anything because I didn't want to be disrespectful. And I didn't want her to think I was freaking out or think that I had anything negative to say about this. So a couple days went by, and she had gone to bed, and I was sitting on the couch. And just to lay it out for you, the couch pointed at the tv. But then out of the corner of your eye, you could see the bathroom that was right in between the two bedrooms. And I was laying there watching TV. And guess what time it was? About 3:15, 3:30. Just in time, if you know what I'm saying. I saw this big, shadowy fog start to fill the area right in front of the bathroom in between the two bedrooms. And I knew better than to look right at it. I kind of watched it out of the corner of my eye. I kind of sat there. I'm like, oh, boy, what the hell's going on here? The shadowy fog, it didn't look like a person or anything. It was just kind of a fog, like a dark shadow. And it wafted into the bedroom. And it was a couple of minutes, and I kind of just blew it off. It was a couple of minutes later, I just heard this coughing and gasping. And Gracie was coughing, coughing, coughing, gagging and coughing and gasping. She came out of the room and sat down on the couch, and she was gasping for breath. I said, what the hell's wrong with you? And she goes, I don't know. She goes, I woke up coughing my brains out. So we drank some rum and drank some beer, and I didn't tell her about the shadow. Like I said, I don't want to freak her out. And I didn't want to, you know, act like I was like, ooh, there's a ghost here, or anything like that. So after that, the house still had that dark energy, that negative energy. I couldn't escape it. She took on a different demeanor from then. She kind of got really quiet, and she would not go back into that bedroom. And by that time, the landlord, who had always, you know, dealt with Joe, decided that it was time for her to move out because she could not pay the rent, and she was kind of waiting on his life insurance and stuff. We don't got to get into that legal stuff. But she had to move out. You know, I said, hey, I'll help you find a new place. We'll get you a new place, something perfect for you, something you can afford. And we did. It was closer to the city than she was. But in the time Covid started, it was just perfect timing for Covid. And she stopped eating, and she was very sullen, very quiet, very, you know, not herself. And she basically just sat there while I did everything to move her out of the place. And then she just kept on drinking her rum and not eating. And two of her cats died in the middle of all of this. By the time I got her moved into her new place, I was like, I'm getting ready to get out of here for the summer. Are you gonna be okay? She insisted that she was gonna be okay, and I told her that, hey, this is my friend Leroy. He helped us move her into the place. If you don't answer twice in one week, I'm gonna send Leroy a check on you because I'm worried about you. You gotta start eating again, you know? And she said, okay, fine. I won't stab him if he shows up. If I don't answer my phone twice, send him over to check on me. So it was a couple weeks before I called her twice, and she didn't answer the phone. So I sent Leroy over there, and the landlord had told Leroy that she got taken by EMS a week ago, and he wasn't sure where she went, and he was calling for her rent. And you know how people don't care. They just want their money. So I flew from Minneapolis to New Orleans. I did the five things you don't want to do during COVID A, I was in the airport. B, I was on an airplane. C, I was in New Orleans, and D, I was looking in hospitals for my friend. And finally I found her, and she had had a stroke and went into a trapped in state where she was Fully conscious, and she knew what was going on, but she could not communicate. She could not move. She could squeeze my hand a little, and she could blink. And, boy, howdy, could she tell me when she wanted the TV to be on a different channel. So I got a hold of her family. So her sister and her father came from Georgia and picked up all of her belongings, including the urn. Now, I bring this up because the urn got taken from New Orleans to Florida, and she started recovering immediately. So I was traveling around the world like I always do, and I got a phone call from her. It was her. She was talking. She's like, where's all my stuff? What'd you do? I tried to explain to her what happened. She had very little memory. She barely remembered that we moved her into a different apartment. She recovered fully, remarried to a good friend of mine a couple years later. And it was just the strangest thing that I saw their shadow that night and the whole energy of everything. As soon as his ashes were delivered, the whole thing changed in. She got very sick. And then when the ashes were moved away from her, she recovered. Anyway, love the podcast. Keep it up, man. Take it easy.

I'm from upstate New York. I've lived here in this area my whole life. But I do have several stories that kind of link together. After listening to a lot of your podcasts. It's brought back a lot of memories. First one goes back to when I was probably about two years old living in Ithaca, New York in an old apartment building with my parents. And at that time they were into the supernatural kind of stuff and they told me one night they woke up to me screaming and I was pointing at the corner of my room. I would not stop pointing or screaming. So my father said he just basically sat there and talked to whatever I was pointing at. And after about 10 minutes I sat right back down and went back to sleep. That's like the first weird thing that has happened to me. Fast forward to when I was about five. We were living in Endicott, New York in a split level house and I never thought of this as weird until I heard it on your podcast. But I used to see static figures. You know, no features of any kind. They were just human shapes that moved within other, I don't know, light. It was just hard to explain. But like people say it was just like a static figure, no real definition. I called them fuzzy people or something back then. And then that changed to shadow people that I would see in this room. And one particular night that scared me, I remember vividly. That's why I'm telling you a story. I was laying there and there was like a in my child mind it was a mother and a father shadow figure, you know, halfway up the wall in A seated position. And there was a littler one. And the littler one came down the wall and came across towards my bed. And it got close to me and I screamed and swung at it. And it ran back across the room, up the wall. And then I assume was communicating with the other two. They looked down at it and then both of their heads whipped in my direction. I jumped out of bed and ran to my parents room. I don't know if I saw him again after that, but that instance kind of sticks out in my head as something that was kind of profound. And then when I was about 19, living in a different location, I was living in a basement bedroom, no windows. I woke up in the middle of the night one night to go to the bathroom, I think. And I stood up and took a step, and I noticed a figure, darker than the darkness, standing in front of me, about two feet in front of me. And I don't scare easy, but every hair on my body stood up. I just stood there looking at it. I was basically paralyzed. And it just kind of like dissolved in front of me. But yeah, that was a pretty spooky story. And then me and my wife purchased a house, you know, about 10 years ago. It was an old house that had gotten moved from one location to another. So it was really, really old. And I did a lot of work in it. And I never noticed anything funny. But after our twins were born, my wife swore at night when she was rocking the kids, something was staring at her. She was convinced the house was haunted. And I had never seen anything until probably a month before we sold it. I was in the kitchen one day and I looked at the stairwell and I saw a black figure. And as soon as I saw it, it darted up the stairs and around the corner. And that kind of like sold me on that whole tale. But thanks for your show and keep up the great work. I love listening to this stuff while I'm doing my job every day. Thanks.\n\n[Speaker D] Thank you, Brian. Static figures and shadow people. Perhaps that suggests that this place was some sort of meeting point between the two entities. Or perhaps simply a passageway that acts as a bit of a funnel and brings all these entities to Brian. And to come face to face with one like that, almost literally, It's a pretty close encounter compared to most that I've heard regarding this particular phenomena. And if I'm honest about your call here, Brian, it sounds like you might be the common denominator here. Not so much the location, but regardless, it's spooky stuff and we thank you. Again, Brian, for sharing it with us. Now, folks, if you have a story you would like me to share here on the program, why not give us a call? 888608. That's 888608, Nig HT. Or record your story on your phone and email the file to me at monsters among us podcastmail.com trust me when I say that we're looking forward to hearing from you. Now, full disclosure on this next one. I might be cheating a bit because it's not necessarily a shadow man per se, but in its own weird way, I think it still qualifies.

This took place years, years before 9 11. But this involved a house where my grandparents rented out. And behind that house they basically built a shed right there. But when I was a small child, I was flying outside by myself, you know, being dumb, throwing rocks around and whatnot. And I heard knocking coming out from that shed. To give you an idea, the shed is made out of tin. It was made out of those corrugated metal tin panels. But I heard knocking or heard movement there. Me being the young, dumb little kid that was brave and fearless, decided to run over there and see what's going on. The second I got to the door, I. I want to say it was a shadow person. I'm not really sure what it was, but I still remember vividly in my mind. Basically the second I passed the shit door, I saw. It jumped out at me, both hands extended out towards me and I heard a God awful gurgling scream. The thing was black, it looked like it was covered in tar. It had glowing red Eyes. And I saw its teeth. Its teeth were all jagged and broken. Yeah. Even to this day, it still scares me. I was less than 7 years old. I still remember vividly. It was a clear, cool breeze. It was a perfect summer day. Afterwards, they said they found me in my grandma's arms, inconsolable, crying, asking what happened. And I wouldn't say. It wasn't until years and years and years later when I told my mom about the story, when I finally fessed up to her, she told me before they built the shit over there, that it was my grandfather, my father, and my uncle building that shit. That shit was basically used for laundry, storage and whatnot. They had told me that as they were digging up, putting a foundation, they had found human remains. But at the time, my grandfather and father were undocumented at that time, So I don't know what was going through their minds. They thought it would be better to keep it quiet and not tell anybody, but to make a big fuss about it. And then she goes on to tell me that it was probably those missing bones. Because when they found the bones, they left them over there overnight. They were discussing whether to call the police or not. And then when they decided to call the police, they went to see if the bones were still there. They were missing. It was just weird. That shit had its own little mysteries. Missing stuff, missing pets or whatnot. And there's more stories to that property they used to live on before it was bulldogs and men to new homes. Basically. Weird things happening at that property. During my short time of me remembering living there. Like, I think my mother saw a weird reptilian creature on all fours, basically crawled over the fence, crawled in front of our property. And then the house that I lived in was literally adjacent to the property where the shit happened. My mom saw the whole thing, and I asked her about it, and she's like, I don't know what that was or whatnot, but by the time I got there, I happened to see the tail of it. And the tail, well, with age, I'm able to tell the size of it. If my memory serves right, that tail was almost 8ft long. It was massive. It went through the shed, and as my mom tried to look on the other side, it basically disappeared. It looked like it went to a different dimension. And then, like, weird stuff happened around that piece of property. I don't know if you ever got any calls about it from Houston, but the houses that used to be there on that street, on 25th street, are long gone now. Now it's new town homes, new apartments and whatnot. So you'll be hard pressed to hear anything from over there. But keep up the good work, Derek. Thank you.

Sheila talked about hearing a very strange, almost mechanical noise, kind of a whooping or wooing sound that I think she kind of alluded might be Bigfoot or something like that, something out in the woods. I heard a similar thing one time. I was out walking my dog. I live in a suburb. We have a little bit of a nature preserve and a creek that kind of runs through the neighborhood. The little pockets of, you know, some trees and things. But I was walking my dog one night, as I did every night, and there are coyotes back in there sometimes in those woods. And I started hearing the yipping and, you know, coyote noises. It got my dog's attention, got my attention, because they were pretty close or they sounded pretty close. And I'd never heard that many of them before going off at one time. I've even seen a couple in the neighborhood. But anyway, it sounded like there were, gosh, at least six or eight of them going off loudly. And it sounded like they were running not toward me, but away from me. So I didn't think too much about it, but I was on alert because I didn't want to come across them, certainly. And right after they stopped doing that, I heard a very strange sound. Sounded like it was off in the distance, but it was the same. Sort of a mechanical sound, but an organic sound at the same time. Like a. This is going to sound very strange. But in the old Godzilla films, to have that Godzilla, whenever he would make his sound, it almost kind of sounded mechanical. It was sort of like that, but more of the. Like a siren. It sounded like a siren, but a living being making a siren noise. It's very hard to explain. When I came home that night, I tried to explain it to my husband, and I just failed to do so. I've lived in this house for 20 years, walked my dog nightly for years, but never heard that sound. And it went on for about a minute, and it made the hair on the back of my neck stand up, and it made my dog stop in his tracks. And my dog was pretty fearless, but both of us just stopped. I think the thing that stood out the most about it was how uneasy it made me feel, sort of like deep in my bones, like a primal sort of a spear. So much so that we kind of wrapped up our walk early because it just was really jumpy after hearing that. But I thought it was weird coming on the end of the coyote yip and their behavior. And I've since heard on other Bigfoot podcasts that the coyotes sometimes do that before Bigfoot behavior. So I don't know. I'm in a suburb of Dallas. I don't know if there's a Bigfoot running around here or not. But it was a very strange noise that I've never forgotten. And Sheila's tall kind of made me think about that. So there it is.

This story actually just happened last night, so it's pretty fresh in my mind, still pretty shaken up about it. So my husband and I and our animals, we live in an old farmhouse and we've been here since about 2015 and even just prior to moving in. And since we've been here, we've had a lot of different activity within the house. We've seen ghosts, we've felt ghosts. We've felt ghosts in the different outbuildings and barn and things like that, and had some funny things happening. Nothing too scary. Last night was different for sure. So I'll start off by saying that I had had an experience during the early morning hours and my husband had an experience in the earlier part of the night. But I didn't know that until I talked to him this morning. So I'll start with what happened with him. So he had fallen asleep in the recliner in the living room and he woke up at about 11:30pm and he looked over and he saw a dark figure that was crouched on the floor, almost like you would think a dog would be sitting. And interestingly, we have a all black dog. So he looks over and he says, oh, hey buddy, you know, and it says our dog's name. And the figure doesn't move, it doesn't make a sound, it doesn't interact with him, but he can see its eyes. And it continues to just sit there and stare at him. And at this point his heart drops and he's like, what the heck is that? And it just suddenly disperses into the air and completely disappears. At that point he's freaked out and he gets up and he comes into the bedroom where I am sleeping with our black dog. We sleep just fine the rest of the night. He gets up at 3:30 to go to work and when he leaves he had let the dog out. So the dog ends up just staying in the living room and I go back to sleep in the bedroom by myself, which is unusual. Usually we have one of the animals in there with us, but I was in there alone and I fall back asleep and I wake up and I look over to my right, which is where my husband would normally be sleeping. However, he's at work and there's a dark figure that is crouched on the bed staring at me. Now I've had sleep paralysis in the past and I kind of know what that looks like for me. Typically I'll have episodes where it'll be a dark figure in the corner of the bedroom or at the foot of the bed. I've never had one that is that close to me before. And then I've also never had one that touched me before. And this figure did. So it's staring at me and I can feel my heart racing. And it puts its hands around my neck and I can feel the pressure of it pushing on my neck. And it. The feeling of doom and absolute just evil is just. It just is everywhere. It's all around me. And then all of a sudden it lets go and it jumps up and it scampers across the back of the headboard behind me. I can hear its claws like A little raccoon or something, just scampering. And then it leaves the room and then it's gone and everything's over just like that. And I lay there for a minute, and in my head I'm thinking, is this sleep paralysis? It must be. But wait a minute. I've never had anything touch me. It's never been that interactive before. And it just seems so much clearer and real than what my normal sleep paralysis episodes are like. And I haven't had one in probably six months to a year. There was a period of time where I was having them fairly frequently, but it's been a very long time for me anyways, that I haven't had one at this point. After this figure had attacked me. I didn't know that my husband had also encountered this figure the same night, but in the living room. So I called him on his early break and was just kind of checking in to see how he was feeling because he was saying that he was starting to feel maybe like he was getting a cold or something. And I just called and I was like, hey, you know, last night I think I had a sleep paralysis episode again. But I said it was different because, you know, this thing put its hands around me. I could feel the pressure of it pushing on my neck. I couldn't breathe. And then I could hear it scampering behind me. And he paused and he said, well, last night I saw this figure, you know, in the living room. So it's just. It's definitely something dark. You know, we've never had anything that felt this evil in our home before. And we've had a lot of spirit activity. Both my husband and I, they're definitely kind of keen into those things. In fact, he tends to have more things to happen to him than I do. So my plan today is to clean the house real good and do a really good smoke cleanse and sound cleanse, and I'll even do a salt cleanse, too. But I definitely don't want this thing in my house anymore, whatever it is. And maybe it was just sleep paralysis, but I feel like it would be unusual for both my husband and I to see the same entity or creature or whatever it was on the same night in two different locations. I also think it's interesting that we saw this thing when we were both alone. That's a little bit unsettling. So anyways, I hope to get rid of this thing. So that's my plan today, is to work on getting whatever it is out of my house.

I am 52 years old, gonna be 53 next month. I have a lot of stories I'd like to tell you, but I think first I'm going to tell you something that I have not ever heard anybody mention before. This has to do with my grandmother who passed away in 1963. And this was told to me by my aunt, who has also passed away. But she told my mother that when my grandmother was dying in her hospital bed, she was taking her last breath. And this is never talked about in my family, although we do talk about spooky things a lot. When she was taking her last breath, my aunt said my grandma let out a horrific kind of like a growl, something that you'd hear of, like a possessed person. And as she was doing that, she was taking her last breath. My aunt said my grandma rose, her whole body levitated about a foot off her bed. And my aunt said she screamed and she saw her levitate and gently float back down to the bed. This is never talked about because it is so bizarre. I was just wondering if anybody out there has had anything like this happen to them or if anybody knows of any stories out there that this has happened to somebody you know. Thanks, Tarek.

I'm going to share a story about a shared Experience with a hag spirit. That happened to me and my then husband. At the time. We were living in a two bedroom flat home in Ferndale, Michigan, a couple streets north of Eight Mile. And this would be the summer of 1999. And I was about six months pregnant when this started happening. The home, like many of the homes there, was built in the 1920s. Super old electric panel that you have to do the screw and fuses. So if you, you know, had to plug in anything big like a window AC unit, because, you know, none of these places had ac, the fuse would invariably blow. And at the time my ex was working second shift, so I would be alone in the house from 7am to about 4 or 5am and the fuse would always blow, of course, every night between 2 and 4am and so I'd have to, in a pitch dark, with a flashlight, walk through the house, down the stairs to the basement, to one of the two walled off cellars. And the fuse panel was in the farthest back cellar. And the cellar was directly below our bedroom. So our bedroom floor was the cellar ceiling. It was really heavy presence in that room. Whenever I'd go to change the fuse, it always felt like someone was right behind me, like about to strangle me. And when I'd go to put the fuse in, an intrusive thought would happen that would say, put your finger in the socket a couple of times. And I would screw in the fuse, book it back upstairs and just be glad that I was out of there. And this happened for several weeks through the summer. And I never told my ex he was never at home. And you know, it was just kind of weird. Every time I went down there though, that intrusive thought happened. And finally it would get to the point where I would just say out loud, I'm not gonna do that. And I'd run back up the stairs. Well, one night the fuse finally went out when he was home. And so I shook him awake, it's probably three in the morning. And I said, hey, you know, the fuse always goes out this time of night. It went out, can you go please change the fuse? And I'm expecting him to be like, oh yeah hon, you know, no problem, you're pregnant, you don't have to go down there.\n\n[Speaker E] Nope.\n\n[Speaker D] Turns over, looks at me and says, no way. And I am pissed. I'm like, come on, are you kidding me? Just go down and change the fuse. I do it all the time. Of course I didn't tell him that, you know, I thought it was creepy because I Wanted him to go do it. So we argue back and forth for a couple minutes, and finally he just says, no way. I have nightmares about that room. And I just question him. I'm like, what? He's like, yes. I'm in the dream and I in the cellar and I'm going to change the fuse. And I turn around and there's this horrible, hideous old hag. And she's grinning evilly. She's bloated and wearing a shredded nightgown and so horrible to look at. And she says, put your finger in the socket. And when I turn my back to her, she gets closer. And I have to turn around real fast and stop her from getting closer. And that's my nightmare. I'm not going down there. Well, as soon as he said to put your finger in the socket, I was floored. I couldn't believe it. I had never told him about it. And I told him what I heard when I was awake and having to change the fuse every night. And we both freaked out. And then about two days later, the entire power station in Ferndale was struck by lightning and burned to the ground. I kid you not. And we were out of power completely for over a week. And by this time, I'm probably like, eight months pregnant. That's my story. It's a really creepy house. I used to live in the upstairs flat and had a lot of really weird experiences up there, always revolving around the electricity. And I wanted to say that I have also found out that I'm clairaudient. And if there's anything I've learned from that experience is I do have paranormal experiences where the entity or the thing will directly speak into my head like an intrusive thought. Those are stories for another time. I joined the Patreon. I love your show.

I was helping a friend of mine cut grass one time at a lady's house who had passed away. She passed away in her bed. I didn't know this. The bed was outside, they were going to give it away, so I said I would take it. Well, my mom had passed away about eight months prior to that. Well, I got the bed and within a week's time I would feel someone or something sit down on the right hand corner of the bed and depress by my feet. And at first it bothered me and then I said, well, it may be my mom, it may be the woman. And this went on for a while and it did not really bother me. Then it came to where it went away for a while, maybe six or eight months, then it came back. And each time it would happen my dresser drawers right near my head so I would hear like the slightest little tink of one of the handles and I would know that within 5 to 10 seconds and my bed would be moving. And this is not sleep paralysis. Something would sit down, then get up, then I would feel like a four legged creature walking up the bed and I would lift my head up and not see nothing. And then it would hold me down and it was so scary because I was trying to fight this thing. And finally I kind of came out of it and there was nothing there. And this happened about two or three more times. Then I put a blessed cross in my room. And that's been eight months and nothing since then. Love you show man.

However, even though I'm calling from Virginia, my story actually takes place in Massachusetts, the South Shore. That's the area between Boston and the Cape. And this took place in the 90s. I was a teenager at the time, like an older teenager. I was in a car with my dad and my stepmother. And it was about dusk, and we were driving to my mom's place where my dad was gonna drop me off. Suddenly my dad's like, what's that? I see something in the sky. I look out the window, and I think it's like a low flying aircraft. At first, however, my dad's kind of spooked. And the thing is, my dad is not an easy to spook type of guy. He has, like, a background in science, so he is very skeptical about these things. But it scared him enough that he pulled over, he got out of the car, and my stepmother can see it because she's, like, sitting next to him. And I'm in the back. I can't quite see it. She's like, tommy, please don't go. Don't go out there and look. My dad was just like, I want to know what that is. So he got out of the car and he starts staring up at the sky. I can't get a really good look at it. So I get out. My stepmother is protesting, but I want to see what my dad's looking at. As I get out. I see. At first, like I said, I thought it was an aircraft, but it was not a plane. It couldn't have been a plane. It was hexagon shaped, and it was very big. And I could see kind of some lights blinking, which is why I thought it was a plane at first. But I knew it definitely wasn't a plane because of how low it was flying and how big it was. And also there was this, like, vent on the back of it that had this pulsing glow that was coming from it, like it was magma or something like that. Something just slowly glowing, like, switching from glowing red to glowing orange and back again. That really frightened me. But I couldn't stop staring at it because I really wanted to figure out what it was. And my dad was just Kind of frozen in disbelief himself. And we just watched it and it kind of hovered over us for a little bit before it headed on. We couldn't hear anything. Then we saw it just kind of disappear below the tree line. So we got in and my dad didn't mention it. He didn't talk about it, he never mentioned it again. And my stepmother started to, but my dad cut her off and we just kind of drove on. I always still think about that UFO to this day. I could never tell you what it is, and I still think about it. My dad never mentioned it. My dad passed in 2016 and I kind of wish I asked him about it, if he ever figured out what it was. But I think since he couldn't explain it and figure it out, he preferred just to kind of ignore it. But I'm kind of the opposite. I kind of wanted to know more about it. There is a redux to this story. Like a part two. I was just visiting with my brother over the weekend and I was telling him about this because I never told him about this UFO story before. And he grew white when I told it to him. And he said, that's very strange that you tell this story. And I was like, why? And he's like a friend of mine, this older guy, he owned like an independently owned store down the harbor. And apparently this older guy said that he believed in UFOs. He had seen three UFOs in the same area from the time he was a child until he was an adult. And he saw it three times and it was always near the beach. Where we were was kind of near the beach. It wasn't quite on the beach, but it was near the beach and he had said that it was hexagon shaped. And that kind of, you know, it leans credence to my story. It kind of made me feel like, oh, so what I saw was maybe not that unusual after all. I'd be curious to hear if there's anybody else that had UFO sightings, especially hexagon shaped UFOs in the South Shore area of Massachusetts. I did look in Project Blue Book, the stuff that was released, and I saw reference to a UFO in my hometown where I saw this UFO in the 60s. I can't remember if I recalled it being hexagon shaped or not, but it was at the beach. And I always, when my brother mentioned that, I was wondering if that was the same one that this older gentleman shopkeeper had mentioned. Anyways, love the podcast.

I live in Canada, in Quebec, kind of in a rural area in the Gatineau park area of Quebec. I'm calling today because I heard a story where someone had reported seeing something like a translucent bat. And it was the first time I was kind of excited about what me and my husband had seen four or five years ago. So I thought I would tell my story and see if it was at all close to the same sighting. So my husband and I were visiting my parents in Ottawa, Ontario and they live in a, you know, not a suburban area. It's like quite city esque and an older neighborhood. And we were both smokers at the time. So we went outside after dinner with our drinks and we went out in the backyard, a tiny backyard, you know, close to all the other backyards. We sat out and had a cigarette and chatted. It was around probably 10:30pm, really nice night, not cloudy, fairly clear. I didn't notice it was windy or anything, although it's been a while now, so I can't remember too many details. And as we were chatting about God knows what, I look up to my left above the horizon like beside my parents neighbor's house and I see this, what looks like a V shaped big pair of wings moving in this like kind of mechanical way, like they're flapping but they're like illuminated. I couldn't see really a body, just the wings, like the way you would like draw arches for a seagull. And I saw them and I told my husband, hey, do you see that? Like what is that? Is it a drone? And we look and he's dumbfounded and so am I. And we're just kind of looking at it. It's kind of shaky, flapping, mechanical, very high up in the sky, but not high enough where it would be like plain height I can't gauge, maybe you know, 100ft, 150ft, I don't know. And it was moving away from us and then all of a sudden another one appeared right beside it, kind of in tandem. And they were both flapping and moving away from us. And we just watched them in total awe, having zero clue what it could be. Didn't look like a drone. It didn't look fully mechanical. It looked like it was, I don't know, almost like it was an animal, but also this illuminated mechanical jerking motion. I've never seen anything like it. I've never seen anything like it again. And we both looked at each other and thought, hmm, this is definitely a ufo. I'm kind. So I did tons of research to try and find any like Google description that might be the same. And I couldn't find anything at all that looked UFO wise like anything we had seen. And it was only when I heard that story about the kind of translucent bat sighting that I thought, oh, that's kind of really similar to, at least visually what was. I don't know if the motions were the same, but certainly visually sounded really similar. And when I saw the picture I thought, okay, from far away, that's probably really similar to what we were looking at. So that's my story. I hope it's useful. Thanks again for everything. Have a great day.

I've been listening to the show since the very beginning, but I've never called in. But I have a lot of stories. So the first one I wanted to share was I was in College at CU Boulder. It was evening, probably February 2016, and I was just sitting in my bed. And I'm a pretty clean person. So there's nothing in the bed, there's nothing on the floor that I could have maybe stepped on or brought into the bed. And that's relevant for a later point. But I was, like, drawing something, sketching with a pencil, then a paper on a hard surface. I think it was my accounting textbook. And kind of leaned over ever so slightly. And all of a sudden, I feel this, like, excruciating pain, almost like a bee sting or a spider bite. But in the moment of it happening. And I didn't freak out at first because, like, oh, it's some weird bug. I mean, I freaked out a little bit, but not a ton. And it was perfectly in the middle of my shoulder blade. And I thought that was kind of funny because, I don't know, I feel like I would have noticed that. And I didn't have a big jacket or anything on, just a soft T shirt. But the weird part was it just hurt more and more and started to kind of burn. So I took my cell phone and took a picture of it so I could see what it looked like. It was, like, perfectly in the middle, so I couldn't see it all. And it was about the size of a nickel in a perfect circle. With just a bunch of the thinnest tiny scratches. Like if I had sat there with a needle and somehow like, I don't know, cut out a stencil and just perfectly did these long lines of through the diameter to just make it like a red circle full of tiny scratches. It was the weirdest thing I have ever experienced in my whole life and very creepy. So if anyone else has ever had that happen, I'd love to hear about it. And keep up the good work, Derek.

I am calling from Cincinnati, Ohio, with a strange occurrence that happened to me. Not necessarily something scary, but something that I thought was worth reporting in. So I recently lost my mother earlier this year and already had one strange occurrence of thought it might be some sort of visitation or something like that, but just kind of, you know, brushed it off. But I was Coming out of a grief support group. And this was at Spring Grove Cemetery. For those in the area. You know that Spring Grove Cemetery is a pretty awesome place. It's one of the oldest and largest cemeteries in the entire country. I mean, this place is absolutely massive. And it was nice to have a grief support meeting. And I didn't get a chance to really peruse and tour the grounds on this particular night. But the meeting ended about 7:30pm it just rained earlier in the day, so the guy was little bit gray, not too warm, not too cool, probably between 60 to 70 degrees. And I'm walking out of this meeting. I kind of parked in the back, wasn't sure what part of the building to go into. And I am kind of by myself. There's no cars driving by. And I hear this kind of flapping and I'm like, what is that? So I'm looking around and then I look above me and there's this bird that's, I wouldn't say hassling me, but clearly either I agitated it or something. And I just thought that this was so strange. Like this bird kept flying back and forth right above me, following me. And I tried to walk a little bit faster because I didn't know if there was something on the ground, like if maybe a baby fell from a nest or if there's something it was trying to eat that I was walking over and thought, okay, well, if I kind of get out of its way, maybe it'll, you know, just kind of be on its way. But this bird just kept flying right above me, like, you know, a couple feet above my head, just back and forth, chirping and squawking pretty loudly. And I thought that there was just kind of bizarre. My mom, when she would talk about visitations with going to see her husband at his grave site that she had a few occurrences of there be some sort of bird or animal that would kind of visit her. And she always thought that that was kind of a sign or a way of the dearly departed just kind of visiting. And considering that this was from a grief support meeting. And I've never had anything like this happen to me. I've been to the Springrove cemetery a number of times. Great place to run and walk. Beautiful mausoleums and headstones. And I've never had anything like this occur, never had anything like this occur anywhere where a bird was just continually following me for probably close to a minute of just flying back and forth. I got a little bit of it on video and I will go ahead and send that to you. I'm not too sure what kind of bird it was, you know, just kind of a small carnal blue jay sized bird, but maybe I can identify it or it can provide some sort of answer what might have been happening. But I kind of felt like this was a sign of being visited. I wasn't feeling great after the grief support meeting, and maybe this was just a way of the dearly departed coming back to comfort me. Thank you for the podcast and everyone out there. Keep it spooky. See ya.\n\n[Speaker B] Thanks Brad, and I'm sorry for your loss. Losing a loved one is one of the worst experiences anyone can go through, but sometimes those bad experiences can be alleviated a bit by one of these perfectly timed signs from beyond. A little nod to let you know that they're still around. And I hope for your sake, Brad, that what you suspect took place is exactly what went down. I hope it was your mother reaching back out to you. How great would that be? And how great of you to share the experience here with us now. Folks, I have a few more strange Ohio stories to share, but first I need to take tonight's final ad break, so don't go anywhere.

I am out in the woods. My story starts off with a couple years ago, I purchased a couple miniature horses. They live in the barn that's probably about 12 yards from my house. I have a camera set up in the barn that I can see up here what's going on down there. And I periodically look at it. I looked at it one day and I seen a weird black shadow back in the corner of the barn. It was weird. It was just a dark shadow. I didn't ever notice it before. My husband got home from work and I had mentioned it to him. Very next day, I look in the monitor and the shadow's back. But it's really, really. It's a black mass about maybe 7 foot tall, maybe 3 foot across, big black mass. And it's just standing there staring at the horses. Or it didn't have any eyes that I could stare, but it was facing in that direction, looking over them. My husband, I hollered for him, like, it's back, it's back. Come look at it. And I. I didn't know what I was seeing. So we're standing there. And then I hollered for my son, he's in his 20s. And I hollered, you know, come on down here. And as soon as I hollered, come on down here. Look at this. The mass changed into a little ball. It zipped all around the barn and it shot around. As soon as I yelled, it shot around and looked directly at the camera, at us. And then it was zipping all around and it zipped right out the barn. I have no idea what I've seen, and I never got any creepy feelings in my barn. It's a happy place, and I haven't seen it since. I wish that I would. And I went down there and tried to put out the energy, you know, show me what you are. If you have any insight what it could have possibly been, I would love to hear your feedback. I hope that you can use my story. And thank you so much.

This would have been my son's third birthday. We lived out in a farm in Clark County, Ohio, in actually, South Vienna. And I am looking out our front window because we have two acres in front of us before the road. And I see this giant dog, and it's walking like a cat. And I was so confused because I couldn't process what this was. And we have all these children running around. We have all our family over. We're having a giant cookout, and suddenly it clicks. This is a black cougar in my front yard by my front pond. And I have all these children outside. I screamed, got everybody inside immediately. This was back before the day of decent digital photography. I did not get a photo of this, but my husband came out because he thought I was absolutely insane. And all the adults are coming out. And we confirmed this is a black cougar or black panther, some form of a big black cat. And we just couldn't believe it. So my husband, Whitney, got his shotgun, and he fired one round into the air. That did not scare it. So he broke out his.30 06 and he shot at the animal. But right as he went to shoot, I sneezed, which was very inopportune timing, and he missed the animal's heart region, and he shot it in its back hip. And it was A through and through. And the animal took off. And it wasn't until about six months later that we actually heard from the news what had happened. I looked everywhere for a news article on this, but there was a gentleman who lived in Zainesville, you may have heard, in 2011, that let all of his exotic animals loose after unaliving himself. Well, what had led up to this chain of events of him unaliving himself and letting all of the animals loose was he was having problems with animals escaping. And one of the animals that had escaped was a big black cat. I can't remember if it was a cougar, a jaguar, a mountain lion, or whatever it was, but this was the animal. And the thing that really got us is odd was about three weeks after the party, we had heard through the natural resources officers that we were friends with, because you become friends with your ODNR officers if you're a farmer. And they had said that they had had a big black cat found about 10 miles from our house in the next county over because we live right on the county line that they had put down that had a through and through bullet wound on its back haunch, and they were surprised it was still even able to walk. And that's my story of how sometimes something that can possibly be a cryptid or something we don't know what it is actually has a reasoning behind still just blows my mind. And I'm so thankful that we got everybody inside safely and nobody was hurt. I love your show. Keep up the good work. And I wanted to let you know we also made a donation to our local animal shelter of cat and dog food in memory of your beloved fuzzy friend. Thank you and have a good one. Bye.\n\n[Speaker B] Thanks, Molly. And thank you so much for the donation. That is incredibly kind of you. And of course, Molly is referring to our girl, Annabelle, an amazing and beautiful black cat that we were lucky to share our home with for a full decade. She passed of cancer a little over two years ago. So thank you again, Molly, for that touching gesture. Now, I also grew up very near Zanesville. The very place that Molly mentioned was home to an exotic animal massacre when owner Terry Thompson released 50 exotic animals, including lions, tigers and bears on the town of Zanesville. All 50 were killed, though there are persistent rumors that a small monkey managed to avoid being dispatched. But I've never heard of the prior escapes that Molly alluded to. Not to say that they didn't happen. I had been out of Ohio for a good four or five years when this event went down. So I didn't exactly have my finger on the pulse at the time, so all of that very well could have happened. But regardless of how it all went down, your account was pretty incredible, if I'm honest. A bit tragic because I'm a big proponent of leaving these animals be. I live in mountain lion country right now and trust me when I say they're more afraid of us than we are of them. But keep your distance, of course. Make no mistake, they're perfectly tuned killing machines. Thank you again, Molly, for sharing your story.

I'm actually from east central Ohio and this is something that happened to me last night, actually less than 24 hours ago. So my family has lived in the middle of absolutely nowhere for generations and generations. And every time one of the elders in our family passes away, someone tends to inherit their house. So we've been there for When I say generations, I mean generations. And last night me and my mom were visiting my brother at his house. And to paint you a little picture, all of our houses are very close together, kind of family farm style. And the nearest village is a 20 minute drive and the nearest actual town is pushing closer to 45 minutes away, middle of nowhere. And we were there last night about 8 o' clock probably. We'd just been visiting and we're walking back across his yard now. His yard is about an acre. It's a big yard. So we're walking back to the car. And as we're walking, pitch black, clear night, no wind, no noises from the woods. We hear this scream. And it's like a deep, guttural, angry scream. And we freeze. And we're like, what the hell was that? And it comes again. We hear it again, and it is like nothing I have ever heard before. I have lived in these woods for 24 years. My mom has lived in these woods for nearing 50 years. And neither one of us has ever heard anything like that ever before. And I'm thinking, is it one of the horses? But a horse can't make that sound. And we've got bobcats and coyotes and deer in these woods, and none of them can make that kind of sound. It was a scream, like a long, drawn out, angry sounding, guttural, like, deep scream. And it carried across the woods, and it sounded like it couldn't have been more than like 100, 200 yards away. And it just like, my blood went cold, I was so scared. And then it did it a third time. And then, of course, we take off. We're running for the car at this point. We hear it one more time before we get in the car. And on the way home. We only lived about 10 minutes down the gravel road on the way home. We're looking and we're looking, and we don't see anything near the road or in the woods. No eyeshadow, no nothing. And, oh, my gosh, I'm still scared. It's like I said, less than 24 hours ago. And, oh, I am very afraid to go out in those woods right now. But, yeah, my dad suggested maybe it was a deer growling, because apparently deer can growl. So I looked that up, and that wasn't it. And it wasn't a bobcat, and it was not a noise a coyote could make. And all the horses are fine. It sounded almost like a cow, like a bull. You know the sound when a bull gets really angry? It almost sounded kind of like that. But we don't have cows, and the nearest cows are two or three miles down the holler. And none of the farmers around there have asked us about missing any. And it. I don't know, it just. I can't explain it. So. Looking forward to hearing what you have to say about that one. Hopefully somebody's got some kind of an idea, because my only thought is some kind of bigfoot, maybe. And we do live near, like, the salt fork lake region, so maybe. But, yeah, I Don't know. Thanks.\n\n[Speaker B] Thank you, Gray. That's Grassman country, Ohio's version of Bigfoot. In fact, there's a region in that area that many refer to as the Sasquatch Triangle. That's the area in which I grew up. And in fact, that area is where one of the most infamous pieces of Bigfoot audio was recorded. It's known as the Ohio howl, and it was recorded back in 1994 in Columbiana county, some 40 to 50 miles northeast of where Gray was calling from. Here is a quick sample of that recording. Ra. Recorded by finding Bigfoot's mad moneymaker, if I remember correctly. So that could be one more explanation. Gray, as you mentioned, I grew up just down the road, less than 20 miles from Salt Fork, in fact. And I, too, have heard the legends and heard from folks in the area that claim to have heard similar sounds. And Ohio does rank fourth in Bigfoot sightings per state. So I guess you never know what might be out there either way. Thank you again, Gray, for sharing that gnarly entry. Now, folks, speaking of monsters, this next entry is pretty wild.

I'm calling from Perry County, Ohio. I wish I could tell you that I was calling about a Bigfoot story or that I saw Mothman, but this doesn't fit that category, it's definitely strange. The story doesn't take place in Perry County. It actually takes place in Marietta, Ohio. That's where I basically from. For you guys who don't know where Marietta, Ohio is, it's spread across the West Virginia border. It's right on the Ohio river, and it actually the first permanent settlement west of the Ohio river for all you history buffs. So I lived on a big S. Hill. A hill. And then there's a big s Turn that came down the hill, and then it came down to a main street and intersected with another Main Street. It was Washington street and 7th street intersecting in Marietta, Ohio. In that intersection, there was a lot of Victorian houses on Washington Street. However, these houses were kind of modern era because the farther you came from the river when they first started building, the earlier settlers and then just expanded out. And as the town spread, there was newer houses built. The house on the corner was built probably early 1900s, and it had a brick foundation. And I was coming down to a stop sign, turning left, looking over, I see that there's a group of construction men doing construction on the foundation. I think they're doing some kind of H Vac or maybe rewiring some electrical work, but not knowing what exactly they were doing. I was just kind of being nosy, looking over and seeing what was going on. You know, the regular guys talking. And what caught my eye was that one of the guys that was talking, like, I saw his forehead. And then when I looked at his face, his face was totally sunken in, as if a cannonball took off his face. You would think Kurt Chayton, like, you see a character gets hit in the face of the cannonball, the face sinks in. That's what it looked like. Okay. It wasn't gory or anything like that. It just looked dark and sunk in. I couldn't see any facial features. I couldn't see a nose. I didn't see eyes. I didn't see lips. However, I could tell that he was talking to the other guys. Now, as soon as I saw this, it totally weirded me out. And I was, you know, trying to do a double take. I was looking back, I was turning, I was looking around, trying to see, you know, what I really saw is my mind really comprehending what I saw. And I was so taken aback that there was a stop sign probably 50ft down the road. And I stopped and immediately turned around to see if I could catch another glimpse of this guy or this figure with a face that didn't have a face, I guess you should say. But I turned around and everybody was gone. They all went inside. The trucks were still there, so I'm sure they all went inside. I was seriously so taken aback by this that the next couple days I kept driving by there multiple times to see if I could maybe catch a glimpse of this figure. I know it's super weird.\n\n[Speaker B] I don't know.\n\n[Speaker C] I mean, I doubt it's a common thing. Have people ever seen other people, I mean, humanoid looking Creatures with no face. I don't know. I mean, if somebody has. I haven't heard about it. But another thing that really struck me about seeing this figure is I didn't see a face. I didn't see lips or anything. But he had a cigarette in his hand. So he was somehow smoking a cigarette and he had no face. That's one of the main things I remember that really stood out to me. I was like, how could this possibly be this guy smoking a cigarette, but he doesn't have a face? I was trying to make sense of this. Like, what could a possibly this be? Of course, the first one that stands out to me is, well, is it somebody that actually was in an accident and lost their face and somehow are living? Like, I've never seen a medical documentary or anything that showed someone that was injured so badly in the face, like, their facial features were gone and it was just sunken in. I've never seen something this extreme. Now I've seen, like, documentaries on World War I, soldiers of World War II that have taken shrapnel and had prosthetics for the middle of their face. And this was nothing like that. There are cases after wars of men getting their upper jaw blown off. They made prosthetics to pop in, and you really can't tell that anything is amiss. Or it could have been possibly like a glitch in the Matrix. If we're actually living in some simulated reality. I don't know if I believe that. But also, the third one, it could be like a bizarro world or parallel universe. Somebody, you know, they somehow jumped across and I was on a different plane and I was actually able to see that. But I don't know. Like I said, I saw what I saw. I was pretty freaked out by it. And if anybody else has seen something like this, like, to know. Yeah, that's it. And, Derek, love the show. Keep it up. Thanks.

And I guess I've had experience with sleep paralysis, although I feel like what I experienced wasn't quite the same as what I've heard everybody else experience. But I don't know. So my experience started. I was 18, and I was working at one of the theme parks here in Ohio. And I guess I had gone to bed a little early, and I had this dream that I went to go turn off the light switch, and I could suddenly see the profile of my own face. And I told myself that this wasn't right. And then I suddenly basically lost control of my body as if a demon was trying to possess it. Then I remember trying to yell out for help or whatever, but I couldn't talk or anything. And I went out and sat on the sidewalk and called my then boyfriend to tell him, you know, about dreams. And this continued for several years, actually. I would have a dream that I was sitting and talking to somebody or, you know, just doing something normal. And then I would have this feeling of dread. And then I would say, you know, something's not right here. And then I would start losing control of my body and start screaming and maybe tongues, I don't know, or just saying, like, really nasty, mean, awful things. And then I would wake up from those. And I grew up religious, but I'm not religious now necessarily. But I realized that these dreams stopped when this would happen. I would recite the Lord's Prayer, and for some odd reason, that would stop the dream or stop the entity or whatever it was. I've had another similar dream recently where I felt an entity try to take over my body. And I started saying the Lord's Prayer and it stopped. And I watched it exit out of my room through the wall. So I don't know. I know that sleep paralysis has been explained away by lots of neurological testing and things of that nature. I have always suffered from sleep issues When I was very young, I used to sleepwalk, and that's definitely a different creepy story. But yeah, I just thought I would share my experience with the sleep paralysis. I was never awake when it happened. I was definitely asleep and unable to move. I mean, I never thought I was asleep. I always thought that I was awake when it was happening, but awake in my dream, not awake in real life, if that makes sense. And then I would basically fight for my life or yell for help, and that's it.

I'm about 30 minutes north of Columbus, out in the country and I live in the woods. I'm on 75 acres. We're surrounded by woods. My house is pushed back off the road. We've been having some activity in the house recently to the point where my guy will wake up and he's bruised and he's swollen in spots. One time he actually broke his foot. Well, this morning at about 3am he said he woke up and he told our dog, lay down buddy because the dog sleeps in bed with us. Our dog is about a 70 pound black pit bull. We also have two black cats that live with us also sleep in the bed. I was just waking up at this point too. I know that my dog was not up because he sleeps right up against me. I can feel him at all times. He has to constantly be touching me. So I felt him and I knew that he wasn't up. Fast forward to about 8am I'm making breakfast. I sat down with him to talk about like, hey, were you sleep talking? And he says, no, I kind of leaned up and I looked and our room is black, ceiling's black, and I have blackout curtains from a corrections officer, so I like to get some sleep. And he said, no. He leaned up and he saw what he thought was our pit bull with ears pointed straight up. And when he said, lay down, buddy, he kind of looked harder and kind of squinted. And he said he rubbed his eyes and then he noticed the thing was gone. Well, he said he just kind of freaked out, rolled back over and went back to sleep. And again, I didn't know about this thing at the foot of the bed on my side until we had talked about it at 8am there's been other activity in this house to the point where doors have come swinging open. I've been in the shower and our bathroom sink has come completely on. And it was just me and my guy in the house at the time. I've always had activity around me. The house I grew up in came off of Hoover Reservoir before Hoover was put in. It was placed up on top of the hill. Lots of activity in that house. Again, it's always had activity around me. I do believe whatever it is is attached to me since it's happened my entire life and usually the activity doesn't happen unless I'm in the house. Kind of spooky, but love your show. Keep it up.

Now how about some more ghostly tales from the birthplace of aviation? Please welcome Hunter to tonight's program. Hi Derek, this is Hunter. I'm from your home state of Ohio and I have a handful of creepy stories, but I'm going to start with the first, which happened when I was about 10 years old. Now I was living in Belpre Ohio at the time, just across the border from West Virginia. So I was sitting in my parents.\n\n[Speaker C] Bedroom reading a book.\n\n[Speaker B] I was positioned in a way so that I was looking down the hallway where all our other bedrooms were. I was sitting there reading when I noticed a figure dart from my bedroom across the hallway into the bathroom. Now, I didn't think much of it at the time, so I set my book down, got up and went to investigate. Checked the bathroom, nobody was there.\n\n[Speaker C] Looked in my bedroom.\n\n[Speaker B] No one was there. I walked around the entirety of the upstairs. I was the only one upstairs, so I thought nothing of it. I went back, sat down, picked up.\n\n[Speaker C] My book and continued reading.\n\n[Speaker B] Now, I don't remember how long I was reading, but the next thing I distinctly remember. You probably remember Beanie Babies, right? Little animal dolls filled with beads. They have a very distinct sound when you drop them.\n\n[Speaker C] A little TS sound.\n\n[Speaker B] I'm sitting there reading and I hear.\n\n[Speaker C] That sound that TS I lower my.\n\n[Speaker B] Book and in the hallway is sitting a Beanie Baby facing me. A Beanie Baby that I do not remember being there prior. So again, I get up and investigate. No one was upstairs. I was all alone. At least that's what I thought. This is one of many creepy stories that have happened in my life. And this one in particular I didn't think much of till I grew older and realized how strange it was. Anyways, as everybody says, love the show. Keep up the great work. Thank you. Thanks, Honor. A possibly haunted Beanie Baby? Sure, why not? Like I said, Ohio is terribly weird. So I guess this is par for the course. Thanks, Honor, for sharing that entry. Now, having grown up in Ohio, one thing I can tell you about the state is that it's covered in cemeteries. 4,100 in fact. And that's not even counting family cemeteries, cemeteries owned by companies or churches, or those without actual internments in the past 25 years. So that number is likely almost twice that size. And that's a lot of graveyards for a state with only about 12 million people. And you know, this next entry takes us to one of these liminal spaces.

And my story takes place on Friday, September 15, 2023. I drive about 45 to 50 minutes from the Indiana state line to my office in Dayton, Ohio. And I drive this three to four times a week. And on Friday, the 15th of September, I was driving from west to east as the sun was rising about 7:15 in the morning. And as I near the Dayton metro area, which is home to Wright Patterson Air Force Base, I looked up into the eastern sky and saw a light that I'd never seen before. But like many of the calls that you have, I really thought that it was an aircraft, either at the Dayton International Airport or something from Wright Patterson. So I watched this light as it hovered in the same place. And my mind automatically gravitated to, this is an aircraft coming from east to west right at me. The light is in the same place. It seemed normal, but the light was brighter than usual. So I watched it for about 15 seconds as I neared the Brookville, Ohio, exit. Coming east, looking into a bright blue sky, no clouds. All of a sudden, after about 30 to 45 seconds, the light trails off to the north and fades, kind of like a shooting star would fade across the night sky. Seemed odd to me, but I just kind of discredit it as I'm driving along. I go about five or six miles further, the light fades back into view, reappearing in exactly the same location. This seems really odd to me. So I watch it's hovering there. By this time, I'm near the Dayton International Airport. So this is still further into the eastern skyline, maybe 15 degrees off the horizon with the bright blue sky in the back and the sun rising about 20 after 7 in the morning. At this point, the object hovers there for a while and darts off to the north once again. And as it darts, it fades out of you, almost like it was being cloaked in some way. And now I'm really intrigued because I've never seen anything like this paranormal in my life or extraterrestrial or unidentified. And after about another three or four miles, I'm nearing the Interstate I75 and I70 interchange, still looking off toward the right. Patterson area toward the east, the same thing happens. The same object falls back into view again for about 10 seconds and then finally fades out. Odd story. I've never seen it before. Could I discredit it as some sort of flare? Was it some sort of aircraft test from Wright Patterson? Was it something to do with many of the stories reported in UFO lore about the Wright Patterson Air Force Base. I thought this was an interesting encounter that you could use for your show. I appreciate everything you do. I can't wait to hear what you think this is and what this anomaly or phenomenon might be. Thanks, Derek.\n\n[Speaker B] Thanks, Tommy. Now, at first, I thought you fell victim to the planet Venus, a planet that's fooled me more than once. But Venus does not just shoot off into the sky. That's not how any of that works. But given the proximity to Wright Patterson Air Force Base, the base that legend says was where the Roswell crash debris was taken to, and home to infamous Hangar 18, a place some UFO researchers claim still houses recovered craft and the bodies of the occupants. So if you're going to see something weird in the sky, seeing it over Wright Pat makes perfect sense. And speaking of government interference, this next one just might be an example of that.

Prior to 2004, I was a skeptic, But I was not so blindsided by the fact there might be something else. But I really didn't believe in anything about ghost stories. People in high school, I live in a haunted house. People tell me to live in a haunted house. When I was In Afghanistan in 2004, I got injured and I got shipped back to the states to Fort Dix, New Jersey. And most of my stories of really paranormal stuff happened in New Jersey because I met a girl that I started to date when I was stationed in the medical hold unit in Fort Dix, New Jersey. And she ghost hunted. And she said she lived in a haunted house. Now, I don't know where to start with this, because I didn't even realize how many paranormal experiences I have had until I started listening to your show. And then I realized, oh, wait, I've had more than most people I've ever talked to. But anyhow, long story short, we went ghost hunting one night in Bastow Cemetery, which is supposed to be one of the oldest cemeteries on the east coast, if not at least in New Jersey. We experienced some strange things. Orbs, disembodied, grown off the old bridge out behind by the church. And then we went home. And after that, we went to bed one night. And I looked on the ceiling and I saw this hooded figure, which I thought was just a shadow cast. She lived on a cul de sac. And the cul de sac had lights on it, and it was a subdivision. So I looked around to see what's casting this oddly weird hooded figure. And I looked at it and looked at it. And then I started realizing there's nothing in the room casting the shadow. And then I looked up and I realized it's not on the ceiling anymore. It was on the ceiling originally, and then it was down. And I sat there realizing we had brought something home. I'm convinced we had brought something home from one of our CO signs. And I don't know exactly why it was interested in me, but it was watching me. I actually shut my eyes and prayed and said, dear Lord, please let me just go to sleep. Please protect me. I don't know what this is. And I would look and it would be in the same area but in different positions. The next night, I said, I'm gonna go up there at about the same time. I'm gonna investigate this. I gotta find out what this shadow was. I went up there and there was no shadow. So I know this was a shadow person. I appreciate Your time. That's my story.

I wanted to tell a story about a possible ghost encounter. I was going fishing early in the morning. A buddy at work had told me about this little small rock quarry out in north Kansas City where Tiffany Springs Road. You take it all the way west until it ends and it runs into some park trails. And basically at the end of the runways of the Kansas City International Airport, you park by this gate. You have to walk an old abandoned road that's like, crumbling apart. There's parts of the road here and there you have to walk for, I don't know, maybe half a mile before you get to kind of a cattle crossing area, take a left and it takes you into some trail area and then it's still a little bit of a walk into the quarry. So it's early spring, and I'm ready to go fishing. To start off fishing season. I get there way too early. It's still kind of dark, and I'm kind of chicken to walk this trail in the dark, even though I have a headlamp. So I wait maybe 30 minutes. The sun's kind of coming up, and I take off walking down there, and I'm kind of getting the creepy vibe as I'm walking. When I was researching the place previously online by Satellite View, it pointed out that there was some old graveyards in the area. Small, like very early, possibly settlers graveyards. And I kind of had saw some entrances as I was walking down this trail. So I'm getting closer to the rock quarry area. I remember hearing, like a horse. Like the way a horse goes. There's horse trails in the area. But I immediately stop thinking I'm going to, you know, run into somebody. But nothing happens. I just shrug it off and then keep heading towards the quarry. I get into the area, It's a really small quarry. There's actually two little bodies of water. And so I go to the larger one. Right when I get to the edge, I start undoing my line. I'm a fly fisherman, so I get my line all ready to load my rod up and start casting. But I think it was right when I got to the edge and I started getting my stuff ready. Probably about 10ft out from me, there was like a big kerplunk. And it seemed like somebody had thrown something from above directly into the water. It was a couple plunk or had thrown something or shot something from a distance into the water about 10, 15ft in front of me. It was enough to make me jump back. Two seconds after that first one, two feet away from the first one, another kerplunk, and I turn around and start hightailing it up to some high land. The little entrance area that's gravel. And I stand there with all my gear and I yell out to these trees. I say, what the f. Thinking that it was like possibly a turkey hunter or deer hunter that was messing with me or something. But I don't see any movement. I'm just scanning the area. I don't see any movement. Seeing that, I just came upon the water bank. It could have been I scared some fish out and then a larger fish ate those fish or something or went after those fish and caused a splash. But I've been fishing for years and I've never witnessed a ker plunk from a fish like that. It literally seemed like somebody had thrown a rock into the water to scare me. So I go back to work and I'm telling my buddy at work, you know, about the story. I was like, yeah, that place is weird. Gave me some creepy vibes. And then this happened. And so we started talking to another guy there that was telling us that. I don't remember how many years ago it was, but it was a number of years, maybe 10 years prior that there was a plane wreck in that area because it's in the area of the airport. Three people died in the plane crash out there. And it just kind of added some validity to what I experienced. I don't know, it would just scare the out of me basically. And I just been wanting to call in and tell you. Possibly was just fish, but sure didn't seem like it at the time.\n\n[Speaker B] Thanks, Ernest. I think it's kind of funny that you went with ghosts on this one because I'm over here researching Midwestern lake monsters. To each their own, I suppose. And I also suppose that an airliner crash in that area could warrant ghostly assumptions. And regarding that crash, here are the facts. On February 16, 1995, Air Transport International Flight 782, a ferry flight from Kansas City to Springfield, Massachusetts, Massachusetts crashed on takeoff when it overshot the Runway and exploded on impact. All three flight crew members, the only occupants on board, were killed. So Ernest is right here. There have been tragic deaths in that area and most of us tend to associate ghosts with tragic events. So the math, maths here if you will. But listen, I'm a monster guy and I want to talk about monsters. So let's for the sake of argument, say that it's not a ghost that Ernest experienced. What else might it have been? Well, there is an abundance of wildlife in that part of the country. Turtles, giant catfish, garland paddlefish, larger mammals, muskrat, otter, and a beaver will slap its tail on the water surface to alarm others and fend off would be predators. And though they haven't been found in this area per se, gators have been captured in other parts of Missouri also. Believe it or not, there's a very famous lake monster legend just around the corner. Inman Lakes sinkhole. Sam a 15 foot long worm like creature that was first spotted back in the 1920s. And believe it or not, the creature has been sighted in other bodies of water in that area. You can read all about it in tonight's show notes at Monsters Among Us podcast dot com. But is that what Ernest encountered out there in the ponds? It sure would be awesome. If he did. But you know, this is one of those rare opportunities where the explanation could be a ghost, a lake monster, or, believe it or not, Bigfoot. And that's exactly what I'm about to propose. And I do that because of a BFRO report that Delaney dug up. Now, the following encounter occurred in September of 2019, less than seven miles from the exact location Ernest heard the sounds in the water just on the other side of the Kansas City International Airport. It was around 9 or 9:30. I was taking pictures of the moon, and I tried to adjust to catch the clouds. When I made the adjustment, something in the bottom of my screen caught my attention. It was moving quickly and seemed to be grabbing things from the ground. It was too dark and it was moving too quickly for the lens to focus. In profile, it looked like a person, A very tall person with very long arms. I couldn't look away. I was afraid it would disappear. It continued its path and crossed behind a tree, and I lost it. Now, again, this encounter occurred six and a half miles from the exact spot Ernest had his experience. And all this information is available in tonight's shownotes. Now, for those that aren't making the connection, Many people have claimed that Bigfoot has the capability to throw rocks either at them or into the water near them. So that's how I see it here, Ernest. But like I said, to each their own. So whether it was a ghost, a lake monster, a known animal, or a sasquatch, I'm here for it. And thank you again for. For making the call.

This one is my story sort of peripherally with my dad. So I live in Florida now, but I grew up in Massachusetts and most of my stories are from there. I was about 5 years old or so and I had come down with the measles and I was running a pretty high fever. I was sitting in my parents room with my mom next to me. We were reading and I was pretty miserable with the measles and coming down the hallway was what I thought my dad it was man. Figured it was wearing my dad's pajamas and bathrobe but it had the face of a possum it came into the room, it sort of nudged my foot with its hand, sort of a toe pull or something like that, and then turned around and walked away. Now, again, I was running a high fever, which I did when I was quite young. And I'm 90% sure that this was a hallucination. But the other 10% of me thinks that maybe it wasn't. My mother did not react either way to either. It possibly just being my dad coming in and messing with my toe, which was very much in his personality, or if it was some other creature. But she never moved, never stopped reading her book. So, yeah, I think it was probably a hallucination. But what triggered the memory was I'm sort of listening to back episodes and you had people who had weird dreams or positing that maybe they were, you know, abductions with memories being placed. And I don't think by any stretch of imagination that this was that. I do think I was hallucinating, but there's that little tiny part of me that thinks maybe not. Anyways, just like everybody else, I've been listening for many years. Love what you do. I'm a patreon. Thanks so much. Have a good one.\n\n[Speaker B] Thank you, Debbie. What do you think, folks? A fever dream or a real life possum? Man? Now, I was curious, so chances are you might have been as well. As to the size of the biggest possum on record, can they even grow to the size that Debbie thought she saw? And the answer is sort of. The January 17, 1924 edition of the Ofuski County News states Cliff Foster, a trapper living near Tyler, Texas, claims to have captured an opossum weighing 61 pounds and measuring 5ft 9 inches. Foster thinks the presence of the unusual opossum in the community may account for the mysterious disappearance of several lambs in the county. Now, that's a big old possum, as we would say back home. But I call BS on it. Attacking lambs. I don't care how big it gets. I just don't see that happening. Because contrary to popular belief, opossums are very useful and docile creatures. And they're a very important part of our ecosystem. They're not aggressive, they don't carry rabies, and they eat invasive pests like ticks and bacteria laden roadkill. And did you know that they're North America's only marsupial? Unless, of course, you include those elusive phantom kangaroos that are said to roam about the country. But all joking aside, Debbie, I hope it was a fever dream. You experienced. As much as I like possums, I don't like the idea of a dad sized possum roaming around out there yanking on toes. But a great call nonetheless and we thank you again Debbie for taking the time to share it. All right folks, it's time. Let's go beyond. And if you're thinking to yourself, I want to go beyond as well, well stop wishing and start doing. Just visit monsters among us podcast.com and click the Patreon tab.

I am your guide, Derek Hayes. Hello everyone. Nice of you to stop by. Now, as I just mentioned, my name is Derek Hayes and I'm the creator of this program as well as the curator of stories, scary stories, true stories, and each and every Tuesday and Thursday, I share them here with you. Stories about UFOs, alien abduction, ghosts, ghouls, goblins, and even Bigfoot, Dogman, Mothman and monsters of all shapes and sizes. And of course, ghost stories. All sorts of ghost stories. And it's with a ghost story we begin here tonight. But this isn't your typical haunting. Please welcome Randy from up in Canada.\n\n[Speaker C] Hi, my name is Randy. I live in Southern Alberta in Canada. This takes place about 26, 27 years ago now. My whole family's always been very sensitive to the supernatural, to ghosts. My mother used to do readings and could always sense energy. I always could to a Point, not as talented as my mother was. This one is pretty specific to my family. Probably about 27 years ago, my ex and I were in bed. It was one of those really hot nights, mid September, it was a clear night, really warm. We just brought our daughter home from the hospital. She was premature birth. So I was laying in bed and I was tired, but I was kind of in and out of sleep all night. And I woke up and I was pretty sure I thought I was seeing things because I looked up at the end of my bed, there's a man standing there, and he was dressed in an old, probably early 1900s, late 1800s priests uniform. And I looked up and I saw him there. And I was pretty sure I was dreaming. And I said something along the lines of, he's got a lot of guts. Standing at the end of my bed. At which point my ex wife woke up, looked over, and she kind of went, who is that? When she said that, I realized she saw him too. And I realized I wasn't dreaming. So I kind of shut up in bed. And we're both looking at this guy and he's looking at us and he's smiling, and you see him smiling, kind of turn, and he has walked through the wall outside. Now, out of our backyard, you can see the local cemetery. Now, the cemetery has been in that small town for well over 100 years. We did find out later that the house we were living in was an old seminary where they used to train priests. And the owner said that there was energy in the house. Now, the reason I'm telling you this, because probably about a week or so after. Now, again, my daughter was born premature, so she was about three months early. She was in neonatal intensive care for about a month before we brought her home. Now, there was one afternoon where again, it was so hot, we had all the windows closed. We didn't have air conditioning, but we had a couple fans going. I'd been up all night with the baby, so she was napping, and I was in my living room and I'd fallen asleep. And the next thing I knew, I heard this slamming door. Now, this door slamming couldn't have been from a fan or couldn't have been from anything because it was just like somebody put their whole back behind it. He just slammed it. And the slamming was so loud, I could actually feel the vibrations in through the house. I woke me up and I jumped and I ran over and I ran into. And the door to my daughter's room was cracked a little bit. So when I opened the door, I went in and what had happened was my daughter. I put her asleep on her side, but she'd rolled onto her back and she spit up a little bit and she'd been choking. And if that door hadn't slammed, I would have lost my daughter. So we were pretty sure that the old priest that was haunting the place was looking out for us. So that's my story. Thank you for giving us this platform and I'll definitely be calling back again with a few more stories. Take care and have a wonderful day.\n\n[Speaker B] Thank you. Randy what do you think here, folks? Was this the spirit of a former priest there at the seminary? And did said ghost save Randy's daughter's life? It's certainly quite a coincidence if not. And what an amazing way to begin tonight's program. Ghost or not, I'm glad something slammed that door. Thank you again, Randy, for sharing that entry. Now, folks, I have a whole bunch of creepy calls to get through tonight, but before I can do all that, I must do this.

I believe the year was 2015, maybe 2016. So the guy I was dating at the time, we were both in the house that he lived in, and it was an irregular night. We were both sleeping. Not really sure what time it was at night, but I woke up with this weird feeling that someone was watching me. And I just remember looking up at the corner of the bed. And I mean, it was dark in the room, but there was enough light coming through the window that I could still see. Basically, I just remember seeing this dark figure of a woman with long hair. I couldn't make out of space. I could just kind of see her standing there, like, looking at me. And I say, looking at me. Like, I couldn't see her eyes. It was all like a very dark, I don't want to say shadowy Figure, but definitely a woman. And I didn't scream or anything. I immediately turn over, turn the lamp on right beside my bed, and I shake my boyfriend and wake him up. And basically I explained to him in detail what I saw. And he gives me this kind of scared, worried look, I guess you could say. And of course, I just kind of figured that the next words out of his mouth would be, he was just going to call me crazy or not, believe me. But his eyes were getting bigger and bigger as I continued to talk. And he eventually just shut me off right then and there and was like, are you sure that's what you saw? And I was like, well, yeah. And I'm frightened. He looks frightened at this point, and he just stops right there. And he doesn't really say anything. He's looking at me, and I'm like, what? Like, why are you looking at me like that? And he looks at me and he says, that woman that you just saw, that you just explained to me, I've been seeing her since I was a little boy. And I mean, the hair stands up on my back. I get the chills, I stand up, I get out of bed. I mean, I'm, like, freaked out at this point. I was frightened at this point because I didn't know what to think. I mean, obviously I knew that I wasn't crazy because clearly he had seen it as well. But it was just this overwhelming feeling that this person, this figure, this demon that he had been seeing since he was little was now a part of me. In other words, he was more fascinated at the fact that we were now bonded in some way, or he felt like we were so close that I was seeing his demons. And, I mean, I was just kind of taken aback by it. I didn't really know what was going on at that point. Looking back on that now, of course, I realized how crazy that was for. I don't want to say he was crazy for saying that, but at the same time, it's kind of like, why did I not run right there? Because it was very different from anything I've ever witnessed. And I was so close. And so when I thought to have been in love, I guess I just looked at it like it was a good thing almost. And I guess my main reason for sharing this was just kind of to hear your opinion on it or see if you've ever witnessed two people sharing that same type of phenomenon or paranormal activity or seeing the same ghost like that, or same, whatever it is. So, yeah, I guess that's it. I love your show, and I hope that maybe you have some answers for me. If not, that's cool too. But keep it up and I will continue to listen. Thanks so much.\n\n[Speaker B] Thank you, Santana. I'm not sure what to think of this. I will say that my immediate thought is that if two people see the same phenomena, it's almost certainly not some sort of hallucination. I'm just as skeptical of the mass hallucination theory as I am the theory that ghosts exist. So you have that going for you, and it seems like your ex had to deal with this quite often. The fact that you saw it as well probably gave him instant validation, so it's hard to blame him for being a little excited. Other than that, I'm not real sure here, Santana, but I can tell you that we hear about more than one person witnessing a spirit or a ghost all the time. So if those folks have anything to say about it, it's perfectly possible. Either way, thank you again, Santana, for making the call. And I'm sorry we don't have any answers for you, but at the very least, I'm happy to get your story out there. Alright folks, it's time for tonight's final entry. And I don't know who called this one in, and I don't know where they called from, but I do know that this call will be on your mind for days to come.

It was like 2008, I think I was sophomore in college that summer before my sophomore year. And I think it's that because right around that time there was really, really bad flooding in eastern Iowa in like Cedar Rapids, Iowa. And it was one summer night, I was in northern Dubuque county near Cheryl or Bald Town, Iowa, and I was at a friend's farm bonfire, hanging out. And I walked a little ways away from the bonfire to go to the bathroom real quick. And I looked up into the sky, which would be over the Mississippi river, and I saw what I thought was the International Space Station. So I was really excited to see that. And I was watching it and it stopped making the trajectory path that it normally would. So I knew it wasn't the ISS. And it started to make 90 degree right angle turns and it was just like the size of like a star. Couldn't tell anything else with it, but it shot up, it shot over to the left, shot over to the right, it would stop, it would shoot over in another direction, it would stop. And then I think I shouted for my friends to see if they could see it. And I'm pretty sure that they did. This is of course before we all had smartphones, so I'm pretty sure they saw it. It disappeared. It really freaked me out, freaked them out. And then it reappeared like 30 seconds later in a totally different spot. It started to make very sharp turns in many directions and then it disappeared again after like a minute. We were all really excited. I didn't know if it was something to do with the floods for some reason in Iowa. I didn't know if it was helicopter, some sort of surveillance thing for the flooding, but I don't think it is anymore. And I've reported this to mufon and I'm pretty sure that was last year. I don't think it was this year that I reported it. I don't know if they ever did anything with it.\n\n[Speaker E] I talked to somebody about it and.\n\n[Speaker C] They took my information. This was pretty late at night. I'm thinking I left their house at like midnight 1am but I could be wrong. But when I was coming back like a 20 mile ride back home, I called the local police department to see if anybody else had reported anything. They said no, of course they probably thought I was crazy. And you know, this was before the government confirmed they have sightings that they can't explain, but I'm sure they don't have any recording of me calling. I just know it's probably the summer of 2008, but it was definitely something that I can't explain and I tried to be very logical. So I'm going to call it a UAP ufo. I think MUFON did too. And stuff does happen over eastern Iowa, along the Mississippi and Dubuque County. I appreciate your podcast.

So I have a story about a bathroom experience I had which was pretty disturbing. And it was the most frightening experience of my life. It takes place in 2015 on a sunny afternoon in Vancouver, Canada. At this time, I was living alone in a first floor apartment. Out of habit, I always locked my front door. I'd also lock my washroom, even if I was home alone and nobody else was there, just out of habit. So one day, while I was using the washroom, I heard someone try to come in. What I mean by this is my doorknob made the sound of somebody trying the door, realizing it was locked, and then stopping after a second. So, you know when you use, like, a public washroom, you go try the door Someone's in there. So you just. You stop immediately. So naturally I was pretty scared. I had a hard time moving. I was pretty spooked. But being a rational person at the time, after that moment of fear, I was able to brush it off as me just hearing things. So I finished my business and then I heard it again. So this was not in my head. I decided, I decided that somebody was trying to get in my washroom. And both the front door and bathroom doors were locked. So somebody must have come in through the window. Then I realized that there were no window sounds before this. I didn't hear anybody stepping around the apartment. I didn't hear any breathing or ruffling of jackets. So I came to the slightly ridiculous conclusion of two possibilities. One, I was either losing my mind, which, you know, it's fine, it happens, right? Or there was an incredibly skilled burglar or spy at my house. Obviously that second option is insane, but to a rational person, I guess it's more logical than a spooky ghost or something. So I heard it again. I was getting very frightened. Started messaging my friends on Skype about what they can make. That sound wasn't very helpful. I even googled doorknob sound. Of course the only results were ghost related. Anyways, this went on for a solid 40 minutes. It happened a total of seven times. And I remember writing down the exact times of these sounds on my iPhone and the notepad. I also wrote, there is no way this is in your head. Years from now you will be able to brush the story off, but it is actually happening. You're actually hearing this. So the rational side of me knew there was someone there or I was having a mental breakdown. In either case, I felt like it was appropriate to call the police. So I called them. Then I called my mom and she came by with my brother. When the police arrived, I finally opened up my bathroom door and not surprisingly, there was nobody there. I let the police in anyways. They did some checks to make sure I wasn't high. And after they left, my mom and brother arrived. They knew this was serious because there is no way I'm the kind of guy who would pull this kind of shit. Especially since they lived over a half hour drive away. So my brother and I tinkered with the doorknob, trying to come up with an explanation. Maybe it was an insect in the knob or mild earthquakes or construction. It wasn't a loose knob by any means, so I don't know why it would be the only thing reacting to mild tremors. Maybe something to do with magnets. Who knows? Anyways, that was the most terrifying moment of my life, and to this day, I don't know what happened. If there are any doorknob experts out there, I'd love to hear your opinions. I know there was somebody that made toys that came on a while ago and gave some great advice to a lady that had a toy problem. So shout out to doornob pupil. Please give me an explanation for this. That'd be awesome. Thanks for the great podcast, Garruk. Keep up the great work and have a great day, everyone.

First of all, I Want to start out by saying our family, we tend to be more on the sensitive side. Specifically me, I happen to be able to hear things and sometimes see things if they allow me to be seen. Well, on this particular night as well as many other nights, I happen to tend to wake up at exactly 3:00am yeah, you're right, the witching hour. I don't know why, it just happens. On this particular night, I happened to get up and I had the sudden urge to walk down the hallway and check on my kids. I got up, walk down the hallway, but I'm still half asleep. When you walk down the hallway to the right, there's a bathroom. And then further down is my children's room. Well, the bathroom light was on and the door was slightly open. And when I walked past, I happened to see a quick glance, a person sitting facing down with their head down and shoulders dropped, hands on the side. It was my dad had a quick stop and said, why is my dad sitting there? Nonetheless using the bathroom, let the door open. I mean, who would do that? He wouldn't do that, especially him. So I quickly checked the kids, close the door, turn her on, look at him and go, hey, are you okay? In that instance, he still slumped over and he just shakes his head yes. Didn't look at me, didn't talk to me, shoulders still slumped over, hands are still on his side and his head tinging low. In that instance, I got an overwhelming feeling of fear in just a Go away, don't question it. That's exactly what I did. I said, okay, and I walked into my room, closed the door and just turned on the light because I don't like the door. I like to see what's in front of me. My lights are dimmed. Finally I fall asleep. Morning comes, I'm in the bathroom getting ready for the date, and I bumped into my mother. So I asked her, hey, how's dad doing? She looks at me and goes, he's fine. Why? And I say, well, I happened to check on the kids last night and he was here in the bathroom. And it's unusual what he was doing. So is he feeling sick? Quick fact, my dad's kind of on the sick side. So, you know, it was unusual pattern for him to do it if that was him. He says, yeah, turns around, goes into room, closed door behind her. A couple minutes pass, I'm like, okay, that's kind of weird. She comes out, she goes, yeah, he's fine. Completely okay. He's fine. He's good. I look at her and I said, okay. That response was weird. What's going on? And she just looks at me and says nothing. I said, no, no, no thumbs up. What's going on? Her response was, your dad was in bed the whole night. He didn't get up. I stopped and I think what was that? That was sitting there and respond because I clearly seen it as day. The person sitting slumped over but they never once looked at me. I don't question it because I don't want to know what it was. In all actuality I spoke to it. It responded back with a shake. I don't know. I kind of feel that if I ask what it is, I'll get a response I don't want. So I'm wondering if anybody else has had this happen to them. I would really like to know.

When I was about 17 or 18 years old, my oldest sister was graduating college from the University of Arkansas and my parents and I traveled to Fayetteville, Arkansas to celebrate with her. We came in on a Friday and then my third sister was going to come fly in that Saturday evening. So we got a hotel room. My parents got one room for themselves and then they got a room for me and my sister who hadn't come in yet. And we walked into my hotel room that afternoon and there was this putrid smell. We didn't know what it was. And my dad laughed and said, oh, it's just fresh paint or some cleaning material. And then I went into the restroom and in the toilet was a large Someone had gone number two and they had neglected to flush it down the toilet. It had created this disgusting odor. So of course I flush it and we give my dad a lot of for it, haha, no pun intended, and went about the rest of the day. Nothing weird happened. So that night we retired to our bedrooms, my parents in their room and I in another. Again I was alone because my other sister hadn't flown in yet, fell asleep just fine. And sometime in the early morning, maybe 2am I'm woken up by this incredibly disturbing feeling as though I'm being watched. And I wake up and at the end of the other bed that's just a few feet away is a man sitting and he is in gray sweatpants and a gray hoodie pulled up but to cover his face. And his face is like just blacked out and he's sitting and he's just, he's staring at me and he's resting one hand on one of his knees and then the other hand on the bed. And usually if I wake up from a dream at night, I very easily kind of blink recognize I'm in a room and I was dreaming and then I fall back asleep. And so that happened. This time I blinked, expecting him to go away, expecting it to be A figment of my imagination. And he didn't. And after a few seconds, I realized, oh, my God, there is somebody in the room. Maybe it was the person who had taken the dump and they'd been hiding in the closet the whole time. So I freak out. I scream. I turn on the light, I grab the phone to call the security desk. And I look back and he's gone. So I wasn't about to spend another second in there alone. I ran across the hall, my parents banging on the door. You know, I'm 17, 18 years old. I'm not prone to, you know, to anxiety or doing anything like that. It was very abnormal. And my parents recognized that. So immediately my dad rushes into my room, checks the bathroom, checks the closet, checks the windows to make sure no one had broken in. There's no sign of forced entry. It was just such a weird, disturbing experience for me. We called the front desk, we told them, and they didn't have any explanation for it. Needless to say, my dad slept in that room. And I joined my mom in their room that night. Still don't know what that was, but thinking about it now still brings up feelings of fear. And knowing that was not a dream, that it stayed there. Whatever that figure was stayed there long enough for me to be fully awake and still see it. That's what creeps me out. Anyway, that's my story. Thanks a lot for the podcast. I really love it.

A little town called Thurso, north of Scotland. Used to stay in Glasgow but couldn't handle the city. My experience happened when I was 10 or 11, I'm now 29. This was abroad in Ibiza. I went with my auntie and my gran. My other family members that were supposed to go couldn't go. Mum and dad, etc. So we were there for seven days and from the moment we got off the plane to the last day, it was absolutely pouring rain every single day. Apart from the very last day where the sun was split in the skies. But we couldn't do very much because of just waiting on the buses, getting our things all packed and the time you have to check out the room, etc. So it was pretty much a day at the hotel soaking up as much sun as what we could. So when it was getting towards kind of end of the time there, we came in, sat in the lobby for some lunch and drinks and I told my aunt and my gran that I was going to the toilet. So I went to the toilet. And as you walk in you've got the sinks and the mirrors on the, as you walk in, they're on the right hand side. The urinals are at the very back wall and the cubicles figure 4, but I'm pretty sure it was 3 were on the left hand side. And all the doors were opened ever so slightly, so I just assumed that they're all empty. So I looked in and just to make sure there was nobody in, so I went to the back one, opened the door, closed it and locked it. Total silence in the toilet. So just before I'm about to start what I assume was a little boy's moan, because that's what that was, that's what I heard, there was a moan and it sounded like a little boy. And I see that just because obviously I'm in the boys toilets.\n\n[Speaker A] And what.\n\n[Speaker F] It sounded like to me was, and I knew it was in the toilet because it echoed. As soon as I heard that, I froze on the spot, couldn't move. Absolute fear. I had this feeling run through me that something then here with me, that's not meant to be because like I said, I checked the cubicles as I went and I just so happened to go to the, the very last one and again the doors were open, so I just assumed they were empty, you know, and I looked through from the gap the door was creating. They were empty. And it must have been what I thought was maybe 10 minutes. I was absolutely frozen on the spot. I could not move for fear of whatever was in with me knowing I was there, must have knew I was there if it made the noise. You know, again, I'm only 10 or 11 at this point. So I actually physically had to wait for somebody coming through the door for their. For when they came in to do the toilet. And you know, people, you hear them, you make humming noises, whistling, whatever. And I waited till I knew it was actually somebody there moving about. So I opened the door and I looks and there was somebody there. I was that scared. I never even washed my hands. I opened the door and I just went to my aunt, sat down where my auntie and my grand were, and my aunt turned around, she says, you're as white as a ghost. She says, are you okay? And I told her, no, no, really. You know, something made a noise in the toilet and I'm 100% certain there was nobody else in there. She says, yeah, you don't look too good. I says, well, I don't really feel good. I was as white, pardon the pun, as a ghost. And anytime that I needed the toilet for the, you know, the amount of time I had left in the hotel before we got transfer to the airport, anytime I needed a toilet, I actually made sure that I was watching the door for people going into the toilet. As soon as I seen somebody going into the toilet, I pretty much raced to the door, done what I had to do, washed my hands, and back out again as quick as I could. I did think of the possibility that the doors were ever opened ever so slightly and maybe somebody had put the toilet seat down and stood on the toilet and hid herself far back where nobody could see them. You know, if it was a little kid and you know, they waited for somebody to come in and it just so happened to be me, me, you know, and they made the noise to scare me, I don't know, but I never seen him. They coming out after me because like I said, I was watching the door like a hawk because I was at this point desperate for the toilet. But I couldn't face going there until I knew there was actually somebody, you know, in the toilet. So, yeah, that was my experience. I love the show.

I think I'm going to share the most jarring experience I've ever had in my life. This happened about six years ago and I was with my husband at the time. He was my fiance. And we went out to eat at a local restaurant. It's a chain, the Olive Garden. It is, you know, standard American Italian cuisine. And you know, we had just had our first son who was only 2 years old. And then I was actually pregnant with our second son. And you know, we didn't get a lot of time away that first two years. So we went out to eat. We had a babysitter. I was very excited. We go to eat and about halfway through the meal I had to use the restroom. So I go in the bathroom and the way the bathroom is set up, there is a door and then you walk in and it's a long like rectangle. There's the sinks on the left and the hand dryers on the right. And then there were three stalls and they're all on the left. There is only one entrance and exit like most bathrooms. So I go in the bathroom and I am a weirdo. I check all stalls before I choose which one I'm going to use. And I looked in all three, they were all empty. I chose to go in the first stall and I knew the other two were empty because I just looked in them. I go in the bathroom, do my business, and you can see through the cracks of the stall. You can kind of see out to the rest of the bathroom. And I'm going to the bathroom and I hear the handles jiggling on one of the stalls to my left. One of the stalls that I had already seen was empty. So that struck me as odd. But I thought maybe the door was still swinging from me checking in there. So I finish up, I'm pulling my pants up and as I'm facing the door of the stall, a woman walks by. The bathroom door did not open. It did not open. And a woman walks by towards the other stall that I had just heard the jingling handles. She walks by. She had long dark hair and she was pale, very pale. I didn't hear the door open, but, you know, I. I thought that in combination with the stall door jingling, it just struck me as odd. But again, whatever. So I walk out of the stall and I look to my left. Both stalls are empty. There is nobody else in the restroom. I look in both stalls. The stall doors are open. There is nobody there. This woman walked past the stall. I could see her like she was a human, like a person. And there was nobody in the bathroom. I started freaking out. I went back out to the table, and my husband's like, oh, my gosh, you're really pale. What just happened in the bathroom? Are you okay? He thought I had morning sickness. You know, I was seven months pregnant, and I was like, I think I just saw a ghost. And I relayed the whole story to him. I went back in the bathroom. Oh, and I forgot to mention that bathroom was ridiculously cold. But a lot of bathrooms are, you know. But yeah, that was strange. I remember when I saw her walk by, all the hairs on my entire body stood up. That was another thing that just struck me as weird. Yeah. So that is the time that I think I saw a ghost. And it didn't even look like a ghost, so that was crazy. But anyway, I love your podcast. It gives me something to look forward to. So thank you, Derek.

I'm gonna keep it anonymous because it's so crazy. And once I get started, you'll understand why I want to keep my name out of it. So this morning I stopped by the gas station, had to get some gas for my work truck and go to the bathroom. So I go inside, and I'm waiting to use the stall. Now, I came in, it smelled, and I distinctly heard someone going to the bathroom. Like, I heard the toilet paper being ripped. I heard other various noises that sound like someone was in there going to the bathroom. I also heard some sniffling and just movement in the stall. And I was the only other person in there. So I'm waiting. Some people come in and out, and I decide to try and open the door so that they would know I was in there waiting to use it. I go to open the door, and it was unlocked. So I knock. Wait a second.\n\n[Speaker C] Don't hear anything.\n\n[Speaker D] So I open it, and there was no one there. And for a second I thought, you know, am I going crazy or something? Because I distinctly heard someone in there going to the bathroom. I heard all the sounds. I even heard the toilet flush when I was the only one in there. So at first I thought, well, maybe it was the women's bathroom.\n\n[Speaker C] So once I get done and I.\n\n[Speaker D] Leave, I look to see where the women's bathroom is, and it's on the complete opposite side of the gas station. And I thought maybe somebody slipped out while I was just on my phone. But when I went to use the stall, the toilet seat was cold. Not like the stereotypical cold when there's a ghost or something. Like, it was just cold. Like no one had been there. There was no, like, place for, like, workers, only around the men's room. It was just a bunch of, like, circuit breakers and stuff like that. So I don't know what happened. I don't know if I imagined hearing.\n\n[Speaker C] Everything I did, But I also, you.\n\n[Speaker D] Know, smelled, you know, like, that someone was in there using the bathroom. I don't know. This is the first time I've ever heard of someone having an encounter with a ghost using the bathroom. So, yeah, that's my story.

I'm calling from Lynchburg, Virginia. But my story takes place in Glendale, Arizona back in 2006, where I was living at the time. I was renting my dad's old house from him, where he had lived at for most of my entire youth. I only rented the house from him for about six months, but for the first three months I had a friend living there with me and sharing the rent. I never really had any experiences for those first three months, except for one night when I was home by myself. I was sitting on the couch in the living room watching tv, when all of a sudden I heard what sounded like three distinct footsteps that led from the wall where the TV was out to about where the ceiling fan was, almost directly above me. I found it a bit creepy, but I quickly shrugged it off. Well, a few nights later, when my roommate and I were both home together at the same time, we were both sitting in the living room watching tv, and I made mention to him about the sound like footsteps that I had heard. Well, not long after, almost as if on cue, the exact same footsteps sound happened again, exactly as the last time. I looked up at the fan, and then I looked at him. I said to him, you heard that, right? He looked eerily up at the ceiling fan, and he said he did. Well, that was the only experience that I had in that house during those first three months while my friend was living there with me. But the following three months while I was living there by myself, the activity definitely increased multiple times. I would find the light on in the back bathroom that was connected to the master bedroom when I was sure that I turned it off. You know those cloth that you drop into the tank on the toilet and it turns to water blue? Well, I used those in my toilets. And one day when I came home from work, I went to use the bathroom in the hallway, only to find the water in the toilet was completely turned red. Not purple like as if red had been mixed with blue, a solid red, as if the blue had never been in the toilet to begin with. I was dumbfounded. I had no idea what could have caused this. I was even more perplexed when I flushed the toilet and the dark blue water came back into the bowl and the red water flushed down. Then the next day I came home from work only to find the water in the toilet bowl had turned red yet again. Well, just like the last time when I flushed the toilet, the blue water came back into the bowl and the red water flushed. That only happened twice with the toilet two days in a row. I still to this day have no explanation for that one. What caused it. Then another time, I came home from work, and at the end of the hallway on the left, I found my bedroom door open, ajar. This was significant not only because I lived alone, but also because I also kept all of the bedroom doors down the hallway closed whenever I wasn't home. I cautiously made my way down the hallway and took a peek into my bedroom. It was dark, but nothing looked out of place. I opened the door and turned on the light. Everything looked normal. Then I turned out the light and went to close the door. The door wouldn't close. It hit something hard and made a loud bang sound. I looked down at the floor. Nothing was blocking it. So I tried again. Bang. I looked behind the door. Nothing was there. Then I noticed it. The strike plate on the door frame had been physically bent backwards. So somehow during the day while I was gone at work, my bedroom door opened all by itself and the strike plate had been bent back all by itself. Well, those were the only instances I had while living in my dad's old house. I was visiting my dad at his current house one day where he lived at the time. We were sitting out on the back patio and I asked him. I said, dad, in all your years living in your old house, did you ever experience anything you would consider to be weird or something you couldn't explain? He shot back right away over the stern. That house is not haunted. He clearly didn't want to discuss it and I didn't press the matter. Anyways, that's my story. Thanks for the podcast Derek. I really enjoy listening to it. Keep up the good work.

So about in 2010ish, we moved into a new house. And, you know, my brother was little at the time, and we'd have brand new toys with brand new batteries that took a lot of effort to turn on or to make noise. And they would just go off at random times throughout the day. And, you know, you'd hear, like, footsteps upstairs. Like, and it wasn't just how settling noise. It would sound like a man walking around upstairs like heavy football. And you'd be home alone. So it was always just strange. Then, you know, things would just happen or fall or I remember multiple times I would, you know, get in the shower to take a shower, and every single bottle that would be lined up on the shower, it wouldn't just be one that fell. There would look like somebody just took their arm and swiped them all down at once. And all, like four bottles would all fall at the same time. And we didn't have a shower curtain. It was a door. And it didn't matter, you know, which side they were on. Away from the door, next to the door, or, you know, you'd always just feel like somebody was there. It always felt very unsettling. Never felt threatening, though. It just felt, you know, somebody just was there. And then it turns out I ended up talking to somebody who knew the people who lived in the house previously. And I found out that while they were living there, their son, teenage son, was killed in a car accident. And it just kind of clicked. Like, whether this was him coming home to look for his parents or. Or, you know, his energy remaining, it just. It clicked and it almost felt sad. But I thought, you know, why not throw a call out there?

My name is Bird and I'm from Los Angeles, California. The Silver Lake area, to be very specific. My husband is a location manager and we were on location in Santa Paula, California around 2007. We were staying at the Glen Tavern Inn, which has a historical participation in a horrible tragedy. A dam burst close by a long.\n\n[Speaker D] Time ago in the early 1900s. And a lot of people, people died.\n\n[Speaker C] And the Glen Tavern Inn became a refuge for survivors. It was an ugly situation.\n\n[Speaker D] Plus there were two murders in the hotel. I believe one was a prostitute.\n\n[Speaker C] And that was in 307. That's a very, very known haunted room.\n\n[Speaker D] And then one was a gambler, lost his life.\n\n[Speaker C] Oh, and by the way, I knew.\n\n[Speaker D] All about this place historically and paranormally fire before walking in.\n\n[Speaker C] So we had to Stay three nights and the first two were spent in.\n\n[Speaker D] The renovated suite where there was no activity whatsoever.\n\n[Speaker C] I actually walked the halls at midnight.\n\n[Speaker D] Using my phone, looking for paranormal trouble. And I found none.\n\n[Speaker C] Anyway, so on the last night of our stay, we were in the room.\n\n[Speaker D] Directly below where the murder is of.\n\n[Speaker C] The prostitute occurred, which was 207. I heard some talk about her head.\n\n[Speaker D] Being removed from her body, but I don't know.\n\n[Speaker C] I was a smoker at the time and an insomniac. I awoke about 5 o' clock to go downstairs outside to smoke and sit in the lobby afterwards. It was grand, all dark hardwood everywhere.\n\n[Speaker D] It was a really beautiful hotel.\n\n[Speaker C] I lounged about the lobby because it was busy with people and activities as well as being pretty. Even though I was not participating in the activities, it was fun to watch. The first people were early birds running to catch their hot air balloons, which is an annual activity. Then the second thing that happened was this big travel bus that said Antelope Valley Paranormal Investigators or something like that. I talked to a few of the participants people on the bus for a long time, about an hour and a half. And we had a lot in common. Especially when I mentioned a fairly famous local English medium named Brian.\n\n[Speaker D] I forgot his last name.\n\n[Speaker C] And he was just so fabulous.\n\n[Speaker D] And we all confirmed our love for him.\n\n[Speaker C] So now I return to my husband and I've been gone for two good hours, smoking and talking and talking and smoking. When I came back, I was met with adoration and. And just like anxiety as well. He pulled me into the bed. He wanted to spoon. Now, this was not the kind of man who showed his affection that way. He was affectionate. He would, you know, hold me and kiss me.\n\n[Speaker D] But he never wanted to really cuddle in bed. That was not his thing at all.\n\n[Speaker C] Anyway, so then he tells me what happened while I was gone. He had been somewhat of a skeptic because he woke up with something and what he believed was my arm sticking straight up in the air under the covers. And he swatted it down, only to find it was my kingsize pillow propped up perfectly straight under the COVID stiff and kept a blanket up like a tent. He was kind of freaked out. He was like, what's this? And he didn't know what to make of it. And he goes into now quickly. So he shakes it off and goes to the bathroom. And when he comes back, it's back up straight again under the covers. It completely freaked him out and he.\n\n[Speaker D] Just didn't know what to do.\n\n[Speaker C] And it was this old pillow on top of it, it was old and soft, so it's hard to be stiff and it's kind of impossible for it.\n\n[Speaker D] To be stiff under there.\n\n[Speaker C] So anyway, I'm so glad to share the story. Thank you for your hard work.

This time I have kind of a funny story. It happened in my house, but I wasn't there. It's my wife's story. My wife told me to call and tell it. This happened on two occasions where I believe we have a ghost in our house. I mean, I moved in this house in 2014. It was built in 2007. My wife, we got married a couple of years back and she said the first time she was at the house by herself, I was at work. It was getting close to time for me to get off of work. And my wife said she jumped in the shower. And while she was in the shower, the shower curtain pulled back all the way by itself. And she said it scared the living crap out of her. At first she thought it was me trying to scare her. Well, when she turned around, I wasn't there. She said she grabbed one of my guns and in a towel walking around the house seeing if there was anybody there. Well, doors were all locked. Nobody was in the house. She called me, asked me where I was at. I said I'm on my way home from work. Why? She told me what happened. Well, second time, the ghost in my house or spirit or whatever it is, I really don't know. Don't get a bad feeling about thing. I think it just likes to prank people because we'd be in the living room and it just slammed the door, you know, just to get in. Somebody scared. Well, the second story was my wife. Once again, she said she was in the shower. I was on my way home from work and I'm a whiskey man. And I had just bought a couple of days before a bottle of whiskey. And I put it on top of my refrigerator. And that refrigerator, you know, I put my whiskey up there plenty of times and nothing's ever happened to it. Well, it was a brand new bottle of whiskey. And my wife said she was in the shower once again and she heard a loud crash so of course scared the crap out of her. She decided she was going to get out of the shower and go look around once again. She said she had my pistol walking around the house, doors were locked, whatnot. She walked into the kitchen and saw that my whiskey was broke in, laid out all over the floor and she took a picture of it and sent it to me. It says your ghost apparently don't like your whiskey. And of course I got home and I could smell it and I pretty much told the ghost and said all right, you had your fun and games, but if you touch my whiskey you're no longer allowed in my house. And ever since then he never touched my whiskey and every time I bottle bottle of whiskey it sits right there on top of the refrigerator and doesn't get knocked off or anything. So there's two little fun stories that I figured I'd give you. Love your podcast.

One of the first real ghost encounters I've had. Living currently in a duplex unit. And I haven't had anything weird happen here before. The energy has always felt quite good, quite clear. But just recently I had been noticing that there were handprints on my bathroom mirror. The first time this happened, I just, I don't know, shook it off and went, oh, I probably just leant on the mirror. But the second time this happened, I knew I hadn't leant on the mirror and I just cleaned it like a couple of days beforehand and I remembered I had not leant on the mirror. I don't do that. And I put my hand up to the handprints on the mirror and they didn't match. They were way too small. So it creeped me out and I was like, okay, I had better do something about this. So as I do, I got out my incense and I went around and cleansed the whole unit and I'm like, okay, cool, that's done. No, it wasn't. Just the other night, I came out the shower and I have an aerosol can sitting in quite a deep basket. I walk out of the room, I hear a clatter, and the aerosol can had been thrown from the basket. There was no way that it could have fallen out of the basket. Like if there was a mouse or something that flipped it out of the basket, that mouse must have been the Hercules of all mice, because I just cannot figure out how that would have happened. Since then, I've had quite a few nightmares and stuff. So things are ramping up here a little bit and I need to get more incense. Anyway, have a great night. I love your podcast.

So this happened to me, I was five years old. I mean, I still remember it, you know, clear as day. So I had one of those Ghostbusters toy sets, you know, had the backpack and the gun and the ghost trapper. I remember I used to go from room to room in my parents house, you know, pretending to shoot ghosts with a gun and trap them. I remember one day I went into a spare bathroom downstairs. My dad built this house, you know, nobody else had ever lived in it before. And I remember I walked into the bathroom, you know, I kind of creeped in real slow, you know, because I'm obviously trying to, you know, catch ghosts. And I turned the corner to where the toilet was and the toilet paper roll started spinning uncontrollably. I experienced it with two senses. I saw it and I heard it, you know, I heard the cardboard toilet paper roll, you know, spinning very, very fast. And I saw the toilet paper, you know, piling up on the ground. And so when I saw this, you know, it immediately freaked me out. I ran out of the bathroom and went to my mom and I told her what happened. At the time she was just like, oh yeah, you know, it's probably just the wind. You know, as a five year old kid, you know, your mom, she just gave you the anteater. Oh, it's the wind. Okay, got it. Cool. So I remember going back into the bathroom and then the toilet paper was back on the roll. I mean, it was like nothing had happened. And so I didn't think about it until years later. I mean, the incident just popped up in my mind and I was like, wait a minute, I was inside. There wasn't any wind inside, especially not the bathroom. So I mean, that's really the only paranormal experience that I've ever had. I'm 36 now. I can't shake it. It's always kind of in the back of my mind and, you know, it pops up from time to time, you know, just kind of wondering what that could have been if not paranormal. I do have, I guess you call it a theory. I think that most if not everybody has an experience to kind of open them up to something paranormal. I believe that it's relatively early on and then the way that we react to that first experience either kind of opens the door for us for the rest of our lives, or if we reject it, then it kind of closes the door a little bit as far as experiencing anything else. Anyways, I'm a big fan of the podcast. Thanks, Derek.

I moved here about a year ago and last September I encountered something that I don't quite know how to explain. So, you know, there was a lot of stress in my life going on and I was talking to my partner about all of these stresses while I was in a diner after work and I needed to go use the restroom and so I went in there and this diner is known for having some shady characters in it. And when I walked into the ladies bathroom, there are two stalls and in the larger stall there was, you know, it looked like a couple of people occupying it. And I see these women like spraying to each other and it looks like they're moving around the stall and I'm like, oh my God, there's like people doing drugs in here, like, whatever. I really need go. So I get into the small stall and I, you know, do my business. But they continue whispering and it's very indistinct. I can't even tell like what they're thing or what they're talking about. I'm like, they don't even know what's going on because, you know, they can't even like coherent words. Like I was right next to them and couldn't understand what they were saying. And I could see like their pant legs at the bottom. It was kind of these like bell button jeans sort of pants and like kind of sneakers. Kind of older looking sneakers. Yeah. And. And you know, this continual whispering the whole time, it just makes me really angry. And I'm not a particularly angry person and I'm not prone to anger, but this made me unbelievably mad and I wanted to confront them and tell them, like, look, if you want to do something like this, you need to go elsewhere and do stuff like this in a different place than here. And so, you know, I'm like trying to, you know, rush out to like meet them like where they're at. And as I open the door at the same time, you know, it looks and sounds like they're opening the door. I open it up and this large stall is open, but there's no one there. The door to the bathroom that you have to like get into to like get to these stalls that was closed. It wasn't even like swinging closed. And you know, it had one of those stoppers on it, so there's a pressure gauge to keep it from like slamming automatically. And I like looked in the stall and there's just no one. And there was just no time for these people to leave at all. And so then my finger turns into terror and I can't explain it. And you know, I usually wash my hands. So I just like ran out of there and I told my boyfriend, I was like, we gotta go, because that really freaked me out. And it was very unnerving experience. The haunted bathroom is something that it seems kind of silly and odd and there aren't really any stories of people like, you know, overdosing or anything like that in that bathroom, at least that I could find on the Internet. And there aren't any stories from that diner about anyone else having ghostly experiences. So I don't know what that was or if it was, you know, some people that were on drugs that were freakishly fast, you know, to a point of being superhuman. But yeah, that's my story. Thank you so much for your show and thanks.

This happened a good 10, 15 years ago. I was living in Kansas at the time, but took a trip to Maryland to see my friends and we did a trip to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania at the time. We went to the Farnsworth house and did a adult tour around 11 o' clock at night. This was an October crisp evening. I remember it well. We went behind the newer Gettysburg High School, which where they found mass graves of Confederate Northern soldiers that were buried but yet move the bodies built the school. So we're back there, this is about 11:30, 11:45 at night. So we're like, hey, cool. You know, our tour guide was awesome. He was going back there. We were walking in this path but my gut feeling was telling me something wasn't right. You know, I've been Togethersburg several times and I've always had that feeling, but not like this. So we're getting near Culp's Hill, the big hill that the northerners took before the Confederates. This guy's telling us a story about it and we see this rustling by this bush. We're like, what is going on there? I'm like, haha, funny trick. You know, you guys are pulling one on us. Poor guy looks at me and said, no, we ain't pulling nothing on you. This little girl gets out near the bush and she's got a like ripped up dress, looks like I would say the late 1800s, early 1900s dress. She had black hair, very proper looking, old school bun in her hair. And she walks up to us and the guy says to a young lady, hon, we got to get you home. This isn't a joke. And she just kind of looks at us, looks at us. She had blue eyes. And then all of a sudden she looks at him again. He goes, hon, where do you live? We need to get you home. Her eyes went from blue to jet black, and she hissed.\n\n[Speaker B] Eric.\n\n[Speaker C] I remember this. I was a big boy at the time. I was pushing £380 at the time. I'm much lighter now, but I remember when she hissed, her head tilted sideways, her body contorted. We heard the phones crack, and she went on four legs, and she hissed and ran out. Now, my fluffy butt at the time ran past the guy that was our tour guide out the woods, across the street, gasping for air. This tour guide ran across the street, looked at me, had tears in his eyes. My friend Caitlin, tears in our eyes, running across the street, several of us. All I remember is that the fact that that's not human. And I know Culp's Hill is a bloody, bloody battle in Gettysburg. Now, did do a little bit of research on it. Said there was a girl that did die in the late 1800s and was buried near that hill. So I'm wondering if that was bad mojo or if. I don't know what to explain, Derek, but I know what I saw. I live back in Maryland now, but when I go to Gettysburg, I refuse to get near that school, and I refuse to go behind it. I don't even think they do tours back there anymore. I remember the tour well. They were great guides. I don't even know if the tour guide is still around. I remember seeing him once before, afterwards, about three years after that, and he said, hey, look, man, I know what I saw. You know what you saw. I can't explain it. I haven't seen him since. All I know is that Gettysburg has a lot of freaky stuff, but if anybody is normal and saw something like that, they would run, too. If you can find any research on it, Derek, that would be phenomenal. Dude, I love your podcast. Podcast? I've been listening to it for months now. I appreciate you and your team and everything you do. Thank you so much, Derek. Have a good evening.

This happened last night, February 6, 2025, around 12:30 midnight. So I was sleeping and in my bed, you know, it's dark in my room. I wake up in the middle of the night over my eyes, I'm looking up to the ceiling just thinking about, you know, my crazy dreams that I just had. And then I turn my head to the side and I see there's, like a brown blob about the size of a basketball, but more shaped like a football with the texture of like, a meatball with a squiggly line down the middle. And it's just, I suppose, hovering there. And I'm just looking directly at it for about two full seconds, and then it just disappears. And then I'm just laying there thinking, like, why would anything wanna observe me while I sleep? You know, I didn't feel scared. It didn't feel like a ghost or anything like that. My instinct tells me, like, it's more interdimensional or something, or maybe even alien, who knows?

I was listening to season eight the other day. You had an episode where you ended up telling a story after a caller called in where the girl ends up leaving her hand over the side of the bed. And it got me to thinking of something that happened to me in college back in. Had to be like 95, 96. Actually went to college in Southeastern Ohio at Ohio University. So kind of maybe in the backyard. I'm thinking of where you grew up and that school was surrounded by national parks. And one time we decided to all go out. It was like a holiday weekend and school was kind of empty. And so we all decided to go out camping. And when we went hiking, we had actually followed this trail into the woods pretty far back about an hour. And then we went off trail and just kind of took a compass and went in the middle of nowhere really for about another 45 minutes to an hour to where we found this, like, plateau. Kind of sat up about probably 10, 12ft. And you could kind of see off into the rest of the forest. It was all just trees and foliage and stuff. But we decided to camp there. And there was probably about three or four couples and me. And unfortunately, everyone had a tent to sleep in by the end of the night. And I didn't bring anything. So I was just kind of sleeping on the ground. And at some point, you know, everyone kind of goes to bed. So I'm laying out there by myself, and all of a sudden the tent unzips and my buddy comes out and he's completely pissed off. I think he got into a fight with his girlfriend, found out she had hooked up with another dude or whatever. Made you so mad in college that he's just completely pissed off and just starts walking in the woods like he's gonna walk home, you know what I mean? He had been drinking rum and he was half drunk. And I'm trying to make sense with him, and he just starts walking off into the woods. And we're getting further and further. He's talking about getting a cab home. And I'M like, dude, we're in the middle of a national forest. You're not gonna get a cab. But meanwhile, he's just not turning around. He's walking in a straight line. And I keep on looking over my shoulder. And we have one flashlight with us. But slowly, the campfire's getting smaller. And until the point we had walked so far away from the campfire, you couldn't even see it anymore because we had kind of gone down off the plateau, so you couldn't even really see it anymore. And I just knew it was, like, in the direction of directly behind where we were walking, because we were walking in a straight line. And all of a sudden, as we're walking, you start hearing we kind of walk, walk, walk. And I'd grab them. We'd stop, and we'd talk a little bit. And then we'd walk, walk, walk. I'd grab them, try to make sense with them. And I started to hear. When we'd stopped to talk, you'd hear like, a. And, you know, almost like leaves rustling, and it would stop. And so we did that two more times. And the third time we did it, you could hear, like, three footsteps right when we stopped. And I looked down, I'm like, did you hear that? And he's like, yeah. I'm like, somebody's walking out in the woods with us. We started walking again, but then we turned around with the flashlight real quick. And it was this guy dressed in, like, a. Like a Davy Crockett. Like the deer skin leather with strings hanging off. I don't know how to describe it. You know, off the sleeves. And he had, like, dirty blonde, wiry hair. And he kind of darted behind a tree. And we're kind of like, holy, somebody's out here with us. So he turned off the light, and we just sat there for what felt like forever. And, like, no one moved. No one said anything. And then you just started hearing the. And it started coming towards us. So we took off, and we ran as fast as we can. We didn't turn on the flashlight, and we just ran back the way we came. And we were tripping over logs and getting whipped in the face with branches. And we got back to the campfire and started kind of getting everyone up. And everyone came out of their tents. And we've got, like, cuts all over our shins because we were in shorts and all over our arms and face. No one believed that, you know, somebody was out there with us. We were so far away from, you know, where you parked your car or where anybody would have camped. You know, we were like, it's a deer or something else. And we're like, it wasn't a deer. It was a guy. And I automatically just assumed, like, maybe it was something, you know, that had to do with supernatural. Maybe there was a ghost. The way he was dressed reminded me of, you know, like, a pioneer or something like that. So I did all this searching to see if there was anything or anyone had ever reported anything like that from that area, and I never found anything. And it was, you know, maybe two years later where it started sinking in that I think it was a dude. I mean, it was a guy out there, like, in the middle of the woods, just following us around. It was weird. And the more I think about it, the more I think that's creepier than if it was a ghost or something like that. You know, I grew up camping and with my family, and then my brother and I used to go to red river gorge and spend, like, an entire week down there just camping. And now, like, when I go camping, I want to stay in, like, a formal, like, campsite. And I've got, like, you know, an arsenal that I bring along with me, because it just scared the hell out of me to think that, you know, I'm out there that night, trying to sleep through the rest of that night was crazy. You know, everyone, when it was all said and done, went back to their tents and went to bed, including my buddy, who was so mad at his girlfriend. But, you know, I think this scared the crap out of him, so he went back to bed with her. And I just had to sit out there by myself with, like, every crack in the woods. Every snap of a twig had me, like, turn in. And probably one of the worst nights that I kind of spent. I got everyone up at about 5:36 when the sun started coming up, and we kind of hauled ass out of there. But thanks so much.

I haven't really had many experiences, but one thing that I have had happen.\n\n[Speaker A] To me, which was just sort of.\n\n[Speaker C] A kind of creepy thing, it definitely.\n\n[Speaker A] Isn'T something that can't be explained through normal things. It was just kind of weird.\n\n[Speaker C] I was probably about 14, 15, I was lying in bed trying to get to sleep.\n\n[Speaker A] It probably would have been about 9, 9:30 at night. And the TV in my bedroom just randomly switched on. The show that it switched onto was actually Dexter, and it was a scene.\n\n[Speaker C] Where he was talking to somebody and describing how he enjoyed killing people and how it felt.\n\n[Speaker A] And it really creeped me the hell out. I think either of those things on.\n\n[Speaker C] Their own, like my TV randomly switching on could just be an issue. If I switched on the TV and it happened to go on to that particular channel with that scene, it's a.\n\n[Speaker A] Bit creepy, but, you know, I've just.\n\n[Speaker C] Switched on the tv, whatever. But just those two things together was.\n\n[Speaker A] Just really kind of creepy.\n\n[Speaker C] And my remote wasn't under anything. Nothing could have pressed a button.\n\n[Speaker A] The only thing that could have happened.\n\n[Speaker C] Is there was some weird thing wrong with the TV and it just randomly switched on. But again, that has never happened at all since. It was just a really strange incident.\n\n[Speaker A] That happened and I've never really had anything like that happen again.\n\n[Speaker G] But.\n\n[Speaker A] Yeah, have a good one.

I'm a first time caller and I.\n\n[Speaker C] Was really excited for this sighting so that I could give you a call.\n\n[Speaker B] I'm from Colorado but I saw this May 2, 2024 in California. I was at Harbin Hot Springs. I had arrived with three friends earlier in the day around 6pm and it's important to note for the story that we were all sober, we had no drugs or alcohol in our systems. We had finished soaking and Harbin Hot Springs has a set of cabins. It's tucked into a little valley and it's a beautiful hot spring and the cabins were kind of up towards the top of this little nook, this little valley and our cabin had a porch on the back of it that faced south and I could tell because the sun had set to the right of us and the sun came up obviously to the left of us that next day. So we are sitting out on the back porch and we took note of the time.\n\n[Speaker C] It was 9:07.\n\n[Speaker B] We were all sitting there, we all Saw this. And traveling from west to east over the top of this area, we saw what looked like a dandelion puff of light. It looked like the pinpoints of light were being seen through fog, the way that water or fog kind of refracts light. But it was a perfectly clear night. There were no clouds in the sky. We estimated it to be maybe 3 to 500ft up. And the way that we could kind of tell this is as it kind of moved past us over the course of a couple of minutes. It seemed like we could see it from different angles and maybe see a little more dimensionality than you'd be able to see from something that's really, really high up in the sky. The light traveled pretty slowly, and it was really windy and very gusty. So it felt like if it had.\n\n[Speaker C] Been a balloon or something like that, it would have been moving around a lot.\n\n[Speaker B] Even a drone would have been pushed potentially off course. This maybe gave a couple of tiny.\n\n[Speaker C] Wiggles, but it wasn't moving with the.\n\n[Speaker B] Wind, and it was also silent. All three of us identified it. As it moved towards our left to.\n\n[Speaker C] The east, we could kind of see.\n\n[Speaker B] It looked like almost butterfly wings, the way that the lights were coming off of it. And it looked like there was a tail of lights that had more solidity to them, like they were short. So it looked like a dandelion with a stem almost. But it was of light and it traveled.\n\n[Speaker C] So it was kind of small, but.\n\n[Speaker B] It didn't wink out. It, like, got really tiny. So it's like it had traveled maybe to the bottom of the valley, and then all of a sudden, it was very small, like it almost blinked out. But we could still see it for another minute or so.\n\n[Speaker C] But it was just this tiny little light.\n\n[Speaker B] That's all that we were able to see. And I hope that there's a different explanation, but it was really interesting, and I was really excited to get to see a ufo. Thanks for everything.

I had a strange thing happen to me a couple weeks ago. I lost my dog LB on July 2nd. He was a large about 150 pound Rottweiler who had developed cancer, started to hurt and he was a wonderful dog. So I made the decision to go ahead and have him put down before he hurt too bad. I went to the vet and one of my friends came to be with me during the euthanasia and we were able to be with him so as we were leaving, I got his leash and I took his collar off to take it home with me. And we walked out to the car and I put the leash and the collar in the back of the car and I went on home. A couple days later, I went out to pick up the leash and collar and bring him back inside. Well, the leash was there, but I could not find the collar. And I mean, I tore the car up looking everywhere for it. You know, I thought perhaps it had fallen out of the car, you know, looked on the floor of the garage, didn't see it. Asked my friend who'd been with me, you know, what do you remember? And she says, you put the leash and the collar together in the back of the car. So I just thought, well, I guess I've lost it. So that was around July 4th. So we went to 1st of August, and I was at work getting ready to go home, and I was talking to my co workers and I thought, well, I better check my purse and make sure everything I need is in there. And when I opened my purse, the collar was laying right there on top of everything in my purse. Now, I know the collar wasn't there because the purse was a very open purse. When you looked in there, you could see everything that was in there. So it wasn't there. And all of a sudden it was there. And I was kind of stunned. And so I went and asked one of my co workers who'd been at my house if they had perhaps picked up the collar and put it in my purse. And they said no. And I had been listening to the show, and I heard someone else mention how objects can sometimes be moved. I guess it's generally considered a strange thing, but the caller was there. I was very shocked. And I really do believe it may have been a message from my husband who's passed, and that was his dog as well. Perhaps that was just a way for them to let me know that they were okay and still there. I do love the show.

I'm calling from the state of Indiana. This took place in Saratoga Springs, New York, probably in 1994. I was nine years old, and it wasn't until I was an adult did I realize that I had been kidnapped. For those of you who are familiar with human trafficking, it's very sneaky. I was 9, and we were at a park with my mom and my two siblings that were older than me. And a gentleman came up to me at the park and asked if I wanted to be in a book that he was writing, a children's book. And at the park I was feeding ducks. And conveniently, his book that he was writing was about a little girl feeding ducks. My mom at the time was a writer, and so I immediately felt very privileged and excited that I'd get to be a part of a book. So I left the park with this gentleman, and another gentleman joined us after we left the park and we crossed the street and we were in a parking lot. And probably just moments before I was going to get into their vehicle, my older brother grabbed my arm, was like, ariel, Mom's been looking for you. You know, where did you go? We're waiting in the car for you. And I was kind of disappointed that I wasn't going to get to be a part of this book. And I turned around to say goodbye to my new friends, but they just continued walking. I had no idea at the time what was happening. So I followed my brother. How he found me is really a miracle. And so I followed my brother back to my mom in the car with my sister. And when I got to the car, this yellow glow completely surrounded me. It was all I could see. It was like a golden yellow glow. And I just stopped and I felt a presence completely embrace me in a hug. And it was the most amazing feeling I had ever felt. And I remember just standing there in this pure, golden yellow light, feeling these arms just holding me and feeling so amazing. It was an incredible feeling. And I was standing there for a while and I realized, oh, I better get in the car. And so I kind of just turned and the car was there and. And of course my mom and my siblings were waiting in the car for me. And I got in. I was probably 17 or 18 years old when maybe I had started learning about human trafficking or something. And it dawned on me that that day in the park, I had been. I consider it. I was taken. I mean, I was taken from the location across the street to another parking lot with these two men. But at the time, yeah, I had no idea. And so I consider that a guardian angel story. I absolutely believe that I was being hugged by my guardian angel. And I absolutely believe that somehow the guardian angel was able to help my brother find me that day before it was absolutely too late. So I really believe that we have guardian angels or some kind of entity that watches over us. And I tell my children about their guardian angels too. So that is my story.

This story takes place in northwest Arkansas, on the border of Arkansas and Oklahoma, in the Weddington part of the Ozark National Forest where Lake Weddington and the Illinois river meet. One night I was stopped along a national park road there, the only place I could get a signal so I could answer some emails. And in doing so I had just sat there for about 45 minutes with my headlights turned off and the running lights on to the vehicle, creating just about a hundred foot pool of light in front of me. And I was going through my emails and I noticed in front of me what looked like two red lights like you would see on the back of a fishing trailer to a small flat bottom fishing boat kind of a small trailer. And they were right along the ground, right along the road, right in front of me, just outside of this circle of light about a hundred feet. And as soon as I noticed them they did this kind of wavy motion that made me think it was a person's head, but they were so far apart there's no way it could have been someone's head. As soon as I looked at began to back away and rise up. So if you could imagine someone was laying on Their belly crawling towards the headlights. And then once they saw me recognize them, they began to back away and sort of stand up. And these red. Two red dim circles that, you know, looked like kind of reflectors that you would put on a fence post or a mailbox. About as far apart As a small boat trailer. They kept rising up as they went backward. Until they were probably 10ft off the ground. They were so high, they looked like they were part of a tractor trailer. And I was transfixed by it. I didn't know what I was seeing. I kept thinking, I'm about to see something. Something is about to come right into the light. I'm about to see something. And I never did. I sat there for about a minute, like, in a daze, Literally, not knowing, you know, what I had seen. I turned on my headlights after about a minute and drove away. I didn't have the presence of mind to look for any footprints or anything. And I didn't go back through there for months. It didn't necessarily scare me, but the fact that it put me in kind of a daze Where I wasn't able to make a decision. I remember thinking, what am I seeing? I'm about to see something. And should I lock the doors? At the same time, thinking, this thing is so big that it really wouldn't matter if I lock the doors. So I don't know what I saw, if it was sasquatch or. It seemed like something kind of a scale, Slightly larger than that, you know, it was pretty big. Anyway, that's my story. Love the show. Hope you can use it.

What happened to me was from when I lived in Miami, but I thought I would mention that I live here because I know that there was a call from 2024 that, you know, was based in Eau Claire here. I lived in Miami for, like, two years, and this was during the pandemic. You know, I actually moved there, like, three months before the pandemic and then, you know, spent my time there. You know, I guess for more context, I lived in a tall apartment complex. My apartment was on, like, the 17th floor. So anyways, there was one just completely random night, random day, random night during the week. And this is in the middle of the night. So I was sleeping, I was in a dead sleep, and I suddenly woke up in the middle of the night, like, woke up from a dead sleep, automatically feeling this, like, sense of fear and this sense of anxiety that felt very real to me in that moment that I was having anxiety over the fact that I thought the building was going to collapse. I was like, the building is going to collapse. I'm freaking out. Which makes no sense, you know, at least to when I woke up just, you know, randomly. This is something that's never happened to me before. And it, you know, hasn't happened before then, and it hasn't happened since. It was just really, really odd. And so I was really worked up. And I was at the point where I was like, I'm gonna wake up my boyfriend that I had at the time, or I'm just gonna get up and I'm gonna go down to the lobby. I don't know, just feeling extremely uncomfortable. And, you know, I ended up talking myself down. I was like, you know, I'm just. I don't know what's going on, but I'm just overreacting. And, you know, this makes no sense for me to wake up and feel this. So I ended up, you know, getting back to sleep and the night continued on as usual. And then the next morning, all over the news was this video that they had that a building near Miami beach had collapsed. Just completely collapsed in the middle of the night due to, I don't know, structural issues. There was structural issues and half of the whole building collapsed. And that, to me, I was like, what the heck? Like, I literally woke up during the night around the time that that happened, with this extreme anxiety that the building was going to collapse. And this to me, just doesn't really make that much sense or I can't make sense of what happened to me in that moment. And I went back and I was looking at the time because I know that when I woke up that night, it was like around one in the morning. I know this because I had checked the time because I was like, you know, should I go downstairs or down in the lobby or should I? And so I checked the time. It was around like one in the morning. And then when looking at the video of this building collapsing and the time, the time that it collapsed was like around like 1:20ish in the morning. I don't know exactly. But yeah, that just felt very weird to me. And it kind of is something that sticks with me a lot as, like, this really weird situation that I had. I don't really know, you know, if that was a premonition or a residual, I don't know, energy, whatever. I'm not totally sure. So maybe, you know, you can give me some insight on that or, you know, let me know what you think. I really love the show. Thank you so much and hopefully talk soon.

Supernatural, no phenomenon. It follows me and my one friend, like, amplify each other. So we went to go ghost hunting at a cemetery, which was up in Wisconsin. We'd been there a couple times, but one time our friend Paul actually had his name call, which we picked up as an edp. But I think it was like a third time. We had gone up there. It was just me, Carol, and we were getting out of the car. As soon as I got out of the car, I smelled burning flesh. That's the only way I can say it.\n\n[Speaker B] And I started panicking a little bit, and I'm like, do you smell that?\n\n[Speaker C] Asking them. And I'm like, you don't smell that? No. Get in the car. Get in the car. We got back in the car and we're going. When we stopped, what is the. I'm like, oh, my God. It smelled like heart flesh. It was so bad.\n\n[Speaker B] But, yeah, me and Carol, like, if.\n\n[Speaker C] There'S a ghost to be had somewhere, if we go or any kind of, like, loop or anything, we will find it.

It was a night, it was probably in the summer and I was driving home, I just dropped my friend off. I'm guessing I was young. I just got my driver's license. It was dark and I saw something on the side of the road so I slowed down and stopped. It looked like a black panther and I didn't believe it but my car was stopped. And then it like went out in front of my car, looked at me and then it went into the woods. It felt like I sat there for 10 minutes, there was no one else coming on the road. And then I drove home and went into my parents house and basically collapsed because I was just like, I just saw this thing and it didn't scare me, but it was just like, what the hell? I just saw a black panther and I live in western Pennsylvania and my parents just looked at me like I was nuts. I get to see a black panther. You can saw bobcat. You saw whatever. I'm like, nope, I know what a bobcat looks like. This is not a bobcat. But since then I'm now 47. This is when I was 16. This is probably back in the 80s. I've had so many experiences. I think I might be sensitive, but that is something that has stood out to me. I'm not crazy, but I saw it with my own eyes and it was incredible. And no one believed me. This cut my mouth shut, but thank you for giving me a platform to share that. I'm sorry for crying.

Good old Gettysburg got a job with the state about 25 years ago, so I had to relocate to Harrisburg. And with the close proximity to Gettysburg and the historical buff that I am, I'd constantly visit the battlefield. So for a father's day gift. My ex wife got us a night at a haunted bed and breakfast. And then this took place on August 31, 1997. The date will come back in significance later on in the the story and the plan was after dinner to just do the drive through tour of the battlefield.\n\n[Speaker A] Had a wonderful dinner and when we.\n\n[Speaker B] Did the tour it was perfect time. It was when the sun was going down right before the moon was coming up, nice and haunting. Made the left hand turn on the straightaway approaching Devil's Den. And when you go to Gettysburg in the summer, you just have to assume there's going to be tons of of reenactors there. So as we made the left hand turn, I paused and for what we assumed was a reenactor crossing the road, a young man canteen. And I would describe him as looking like the kid in high school who was only like in 9th grade or 8th grade, but was extremely big for his age. Chubby and had the pretty mature beard growth, not quite the full beard, just the scraggly sideburn beard, mustache, et cetera, but a face no more than 15 years old if that dirty face, etc. And what struck my attention and even my ex wife as we talked about it later, was the shoes. The shoes were just. I looked at them and I said man, those look authentic. They were the brown, leathery up to the ankle, untied, black shoelaces ripped and torn. I remember the details because they look so darn authentic. So he crosses the road and sure enough, I'm talking not even 1000, 1002. Look in the rear view mirror, side mirror, my ex wife goes, is he gone? Yes, he had disappeared. And in this area where you make the left hand turn, where he was crossing the road, absolutely no boulders anywhere for this person to hide. Especially that quick as I said where he made the crossing, the only boulder there was a small little rock that went up to about your ankle. This apparition disappeared, plain and simple. So you know, we were like astounded and we talked about it and continued our drive. Got back to the bed and breakfast and you know, after dinner and everything, my ex said I'm gonna turn in and go to bed. I still had some nervous energy and I said, well, there's a pub down below, I'm gonna go and have a pint of ale and I go down to the pub and soon as I sit at the bar stool, the bartender had her back to me and I look up on the TV and the date August 31, 1997. Tragically, there on CNN, Lady Di just had her tragic car accident. And I was like, wow, what an evening. What a confluence of events. The first aberration I've ever seen in my life. Ex wife's only apparition she's ever seen. And Lady Di gets into a car accident and dies. By the way, nothing happened at the bed and breakfast. I went upstairs, woke up, my wife told her what happened and you know, we just said, what a crazy evening. Fast forward about a week later, the first chance I got to go back to that site of the apparition, I went and this was around lunchtime. I drove down to the exact site, pulled over, I get out, I'm looking around, there's a plaque and to paraphrase the plaque said where that boy crossed, there was a battle that took place with soldiers from Allegheny and Beaver County. And me and my ex wife, born and raised in Allegheny, moved to Beaver.\n\n[Speaker A] County before we moved to Harrisburg.\n\n[Speaker B] So I just thought that was, you know. So there you go. Derek, love the show. Keep it spooky. And being a Steeler fan with Will Howard now.

This is Justin the fireman from southwestern Pennsylvania again. So me and this dude were hanging out one night, you know, just kicking it forward, and we end up hitting up these two girls we were interested in. The two girls come and pick us up and we go and we're like, man, what are we going to do? Let's do something. So we're like, let's go ghost hunting. Let's go get in something spooky. You know, it's late at night, and we're like, yeah, let's do that. So we're looking up, like, notorious haunted places around us. This old South Point mental institute in Canterburg, which was 15, 20 miles away from us, something like that. Nice little trip, you know, hang out in the car, listen to music, whatever. And it was obviously a dilapidated building. Everything was bored up. We should not have been in the building. So we go out there. There's four of us. We have one flashlight. The rest are cell phone lights. Nothing serious, you know, going out, gigging around, doing stuff we shouldn't, being kids. So we go into this building, right? Spooky vibes, man. I mean, this building is an old mental institution. It's dilapidated, no power, you know, spray paint, graffiti walls. There's actually like a dirt ramp going up to an old window that's busted out. We had to climb through the window. I have the flashlight. So we go walking in to like, I don't know, I guess it was like a kitchen area. And we're like, see the basement? Looking down the basement steps and everything. We start to like. I don't know what it was, but I know that it got really cold where we were in the kitchen area and we started hearing things. Granted, it could have been critters, could have been anything else, but we got freaked out, the girls got freaked out. So we're like, okay, all right, that's cool. We've seen enough. Let's get out of here. So we go back to the room where we came into the window, and we're getting ready to go out. And I'm like last, you know, trying to be the tough guy for the girls, you know, with the flashlight, standing guard at the back. And the loudest, I mean, the loudest bang I ever heard in my life. Granted, it doesn't mean it's paranormal. It could have been a homeless person, anything. There was no one else around. I don't know what it was, but the loudest bang I ever heard in my life, short of a shotgun, I mean, it shook the whole building. Just my instinct right away was, I'm out, I'm gone. Self preservation mode. Fight or flight. I wasn't fighting. I was out that window. But the bad part is I was out the window with the flashlight and before everybody else. So the girls and my buddy are still in this room. I didi out the window, like face first style. Tuck and roll, hope for the best. I land, roll, get up, start running. I literally turn around as the one girl is the final one jumping out of the window, landing on top of the other two. And I felt instantly terrible. And I knew that the chance that I had with this female was over because I just left them high and dry. Like, I was gone, though. So I go running back over. I'm like, you guys okay? The one girl busted her knee up. It was a mess, right? So we all get out of there. Everybody stands up, run back to the car, get in the car. But one girl was crying. The other one's like, oh, my knee. You know, it was just a mess. What was that? What was that? I don't know. I don't know. You left us. I heard the bang. I was gone. I wasn't sticking around to find out. I'm sorry. You should have been, like, right behind me. You should have went first. I don't know. So we leave, you know, they drop us off. We actually do end up hanging out again. Same group. Actually, it was five of us this time. Two of my buddies, me and the two girls, we go back. This time, we ended up, you know, back in the South Point. We're exploring more. And this time, me and my buddies were drinking. The girls weren't drinking, but me and my buddies were drinking. And we go up to this old, like, common area. I guess it was up on the steps. You know, we're creeping around the hospital. We're taking our dull time. Freak out. I mean, I was just thinking of the bang the whole time, you know? And we got our cell phones out, and we sit in this comma, and we're like, all right, let's do an EVP session. So we do an EVP session, and my buddy John and me were the only two talking. You know, the girls were down the other end. The other dude that was there was with them down the other end, like, sitting on the windowsill or whatever. Me and him were kind of in between the door of the common area and door of the hallway, and we're, you know, talking. We're asking questions, and, man, I wish I still had the EVP recording. I had it for the longest time. So you hear me ask a question, you know, the basic common question. Who are you? What did you die from? You know, what do you want? You know, what's death? Like, blah, blah, blah. So as I'm talking, you know, I pause and wait for the response, like you're supposed to. And everybody called me Po growing up. That was my nickname. The first response was clearly an evp, a whisper. I don't know if it was a man or a woman. There was a whisper, and it said po, just like that. And obviously, we didn't hear in real time. This was later. We heard it. You know, we didn't listen to him then and there. And then the Next EVP was I said, don't be scared, talk to us. You know, trying to be tough guy, I guess I probably provoking like I shouldn't do. The next one is definitely a male and he definitely wasn't whispering. It was kind of raspy. We're not scared just like that. I honestly didn't hear anything in real time, but yeah, man. We ended up going home and calling it a night and listening to the EVPs, I think. But one girl that I was interested in sent them to me the next day and I heard them clear as day. She pointed them out like it was insane. That was the first time I ever caught any evidence. But love the show. Do what you're doing, bro. Keep doing it.

About 30 minutes north of Pittsburgh, I'd say. And this particular story took place in Grove City, Pennsylvania, which is about another hour away. I was out doing A delivery for work, bringing a pallet of stuff out for customers in our work pickup truck. And it was a clear day, really hot for what it should have been, you know, that time of year. And this was maybe a month or so ago. And as I get to the customer and get unloaded, the guy comes out on a forklift and a couple other guys come out with him just to chat. And the guy on the fork forklift asks us, yo, do you guys see that over there? And starts pointing over to the road. And we're all like, no, what? And as soon as I turn and look, there's a guy in full hazmat garb, like neon yellow, like stereotypical rainbow colored hazmat suit with like thick winter gloves and thick winter boots. And he was wearing like one of those N95 face masks too. So the only thing you could really see on this guy were his eyes. And he was almost abnormally tall, like well over six foot something. And he just looked so out of place and so off. Even the way he was walking, it looked like he didn't really know how. And his arms were moving in a really exaggerated motion. It almost looked like he was dancing while he was walking is the best way I can describe it. And as he's doing this weird dance walk, a kid comes up from the opposite direction of him on a bicycle. And he stops the kid and has like a little chat with them and then, you know, sends the kid on his way. And I'm just, you know, in a trance just staring at this guy, seeing what he's gonna do. And one of the other guys that was helping unload my truck asked if he knew that guy. Like he yelled at the guy like, hey, make sure someone knows him. And the dude in the hazmat suit just kept walking. And then he eventually stops and sees me and gives this like really exaggerated, like full arm wave at me before walking away. And I could kind of tell that he was smiling really big under that face mask. Like his eyes looked like they were scrunched up like you would if you were giving a really big grin at somebody. And he just kept walking. And the way this warehouse I was at was positioned is that there's the security shack right at the entrance, but other than that you can see the road just fine. And it's almost a one way road. There's no way that you can, you know, lose someone. If you're looking at that road, there's not really anything intersecting, no woods or anything. It's perfectly clear. And the guard Sack, maybe blocks. Only about 10ft of vision. But as he walks past this guard shack, he just vanishes. And I sit there for another minute or so, just looking, waiting for him, you know, to pop out on the other side or something, and he never does. And I even kind of took a lap around the building, going towards the security shack to look again, and he was gone. It was like there wasn't even a trace of him. And I know it wasn't any kind of trick or illusion, because at least three or four other men other than myself, you know, saw it, too. And I just have no idea what it could have been. But I've done research on, you know, paranormal entities, and I know that southwest Pennsylvania and parts of Ohio are kind of hot spots for possible extraterrestrial encounters and activity. And Pennsylvania also isn't too far off from where sightings of the Grinning man phenomenon have occurred. The only thing that rules out the Grinning man for me, though, is that you couldn't see the grin itself. Unless he was trying to disguise himself even more. Or maybe he was interdimensional and kind of just clipped in and out for a minute. I don't know. But the thing was really off putting. All of us were weirded out by it, and I even had this kind of sense of dread in the pit of my stomach just looking at this guy. Like, I had the feeling that whatever this guy was, he wasn't supposed to be here. That's my story. Thank you so much for the podcast. I love and enjoy listening to it, and I hope everyone stays spooky out there.	3453.8	3799	other	Grove City,

And a story on season 15, episode 13 jogged my memory and reminded me of something that happened at the beginning of this year. It was one morning after my husband had left for work. I was in the kitchen getting ready for the day, packing my lunch, etc. And I heard what sounded like my husband say, phi, gotta go out. So our dog's name is Phoebe. And whenever my husband would take his.\n\n[Speaker B] Lunchbox out to his truck and start.\n\n[Speaker C] His truck for the day, he would.\n\n[Speaker B] Ask her if she needs to go out.\n\n[Speaker C] And I knew that he had already left for the day, but the dog.\n\n[Speaker B] And I just kind of looked at.\n\n[Speaker C] Each other like, is he still here? Did he come back? I looked around the house and he.\n\n[Speaker B] Had not come back.\n\n[Speaker C] And then maybe a week or so later, I was running errands and my husband was home with our daughter.\n\n[Speaker B] And when I got home, he told.\n\n[Speaker C] Me he was changing her diaper in her room. And it sounded like I had come home.\n\n[Speaker B] And I said hello or something.\n\n[Speaker C] I don't remember exactly what he said. He heard my voice say, but him and my daughter both looked at each other again, just like me and the dog. And she started saying, mama. And when they came out of the room, I wasn't home yet. So we didn't see each other's doppelgangers. We just heard each other's voices. But yeah, so that's a weird similar story that happened to us, and I wanted to send it in.

I just have the weirdest thing happen to me, and that's why I'm calling right now. So I work at a school district, and it's about 20 minutes away from my house. Every single day, I have to commute home, and I typically take the highway just because it's a little faster compared to taking all the back roads. But today, when I was driving home, I always get off on this specific exit. It's exit 77. But exit 80 is also an exit I can take to get home, but it's a little further up, so it's easier for me to take 77, be able to get off the road. There's less, like, detouring, less traffic I have to deal with. But today, as I was driving home, I somehow completely missed my exit. I'm not actually sure what happened, because one point I was driving down the road, and it was a little bit before my exit. And then all of a sudden, I'm a lot further down the road, noticing that the mile marker is reading, like, 77.5, which means I completely missed my exit. I just took the Exit 80 to get home, but I don't remember at first seeing exit 77 as I was driving home. So not sure if that's a little bit of a time thing. I wasn't paying attention to my clock, so I can't unfortunately say if I'm missing time or anything. Where it's glitch in the matrix, I'm not sure, but I missed my exit. Thankfully, it doesn't take me much to get back home. So that's the good news. I have more stories to tell. But again, thank you guys for the podcast so much. Have a nice day.

My name is Eric. I had a job I was doing working on a triplex in Carnegie. It was like a huge mansion from, like, you know, 100 years ago. Big building. And the owner worked with computer firm and he wanted the whole top floor renovated and had done, you know, carpeting, painting, the whole floor, all new kitchen. And I remember doing the plumbing. It was like an open floor plan too, so there was no real doors or anything. But the stairs were in the center, wrapping around, going all the way up. And every time I'd go into work, I would like, you know, close the door and lock it behind me because the other tenants, I didn't want them, you know, coming in or whatever. And I remember working under the sink in the kitchen and I heard an old lady cough, like from that center stairway. I could tell exactly where it's coming from. And the hair on the back of my neck stood up and it just felt really weird, odd. And I just kept working and tried ignoring it. Eventually, in like a minute or two, I remember, like turning up the radio so I couldn't hear anything else. And then, you know, probably like 10 minutes later, 15 minutes later, I went down the stairs to make sure the door was closed and locked still. And it was. Yeah, that was it. You know, nothing really crazy there. Just really odd and weird. And that was about 25 years ago, another episode I had about 11, 12 years ago. I was working for HUD for a senior housing development outside the city in Lawrenceville. It was an eight story high rise and they were renovating. If you could envision a building eight stories tall and about 20 units on each floor, and they would like split the whole building in half and they would demolish and renovate each floor, going up on one side, and then people would move in and then people would be living on the other side. And then we would pick up their belongings and move them into the renovated half. And then they would demolish and renovate from the top going down on the other side. And this was at a stage I believe was a third floor on the second phase, where I had to move a resident's belongings from the side of that building to another unit. And I remember boxing up belongings and, you know, picking up furniture, putting them on carts. I was working alone and I heard it was like a yell, scream, like, help me, help me. But it was weird. It was like through a megaphone, through a radio. It wasn't like a real, you know, like Person calling, but, you know, somebody help me, you know? And, yeah, I was the facilities manager there, so I had a passkey, master key, and I went to every room on that floor looking for the person that, yo, help me. Help me. And I went to every room and nobody was home. I went upstairs, downstairs. But, you know, the sound I heard was, like, pretty close. Yeah, that really freaked me out, because previously I would always hear, you know, stories or rumors. I remember one resident saying, like, she would get a knock on the door every night between, like, 2 or 4 in the morning, and she would look through the little, you know, peephole, and nobody there. And I would hear different stories about people seeing stuff. And that's just another weird little experience I had. Can't explain it.

Although this first story that I have to share happened in a very small town in western Pennsylvania named Dunbar. Very, very small town. Anyway, when I was five years old, I with my mother a lot in bed at night because I was, you know, just so little and I loved being with my mom all the time. And one night sh was really, really in a deep sleep. And I was woken up by our front door jiggling. And it kind of threw me off for a minute. I was so little that when the first time that it happened, I kind of just brushed it off and I didn't wake up my mom. But then the next night, I was woken up by the same thing. The front door of our home.\n\n[Speaker C] I could hear jiggling.\n\n[Speaker B] Now, you may wonder how I could hear our front door being jiggled from the bedroom. It was a very tiny home, so I absolutely could hear our front door from my mom's bedroom. So the second time it happened, heard the jiggle, jiggle, jiggle, and woke my mom off. And I said, mommy, I hear the door jiggling. And she kind of brushed it off and just said, oh, you know, it's probably a dream or just probably, you know, your imagination. And I was like, okay, you know, when your parents says that, you definitely think they're right. So I just went back to sleep. Following night, heard the door jiggling again, woke my mom up right away. And this time my mom got up to check. Nothing there. A few nights later. You know that feeling you can get when you feel like someone's staring at you? I can get it now, even as an adult, but as a kid, I could still tell someone's looking at you. Or if you have eyes on you, get this certain feeling. Well, I woke up out of sleep thinking and feeling someone's looking at me. Woke up and saw a very tall, lean man bent down over top of me, staring directly in my face. And I was frozen in fear. Couldn't move, couldn't speak, couldn't do anything. The only thing I could do was close my eyes so tightly because, again, I was five years old, possibly going on sick back in the late 80s. So at that time, I just didn't know what else to do except shut my eyes. I shut my eyes for a few seconds, opened them back up, and he was gone. To this day, I don't know who it was. And I remember the next morning because I did eventually fall back to sleep. I woke up and told my mom. They were so freaked out. And when I talk about it to this day, I still get extremely scared. It's like, who was that? Why were they hovering over me? Why were they looking down at me? And my mom always says, you know, that my story has never changed. As a kid, when I would tell it, it would just be the exact same. That's the first creepy encounter I had.

This was a story that I'm going to tell you that happened to me in about 20 some years ago, about 1997, 1998. I was about 10 or 12 years old. My bedroom was originally two rooms that we broke down a dividing wall and made it Instead of a 10 foot by 12 foot room, it was a 10 foot by 12 foot and an additional 8 foot by 10 foot room. So I had a very large room for a 12 year old. So that long part of that room, there was a far window and the foot of the bed faced that long part of the room. It's kind of hard to piece together the details, but what I can really remember on how it started was it felt like it was a sleep paralysis. I was dreaming, but I wasn't dreaming. I was dreaming about being in my room, but I was unsure of whether or not I was actually in a dream. And I can remember sleeping in my bed and in this dream or awake state of sleep paralysis, I can remember this thing coming through that far window. It was, Sorry, I'm shaking a little bit remembering this. It was tall, it was dark, and it didn't seem like it was a shadow. It felt like it just was the absence of light. It was a void, like it was there, but it wasn't there. And it kind of clipped in and out of reality. Like I could see through it, but I could still see that depth of emptiness inside of kind of floated. It had arms that had a face shape or a head shape, it had a torso, but it didn't seem to have anything below the knees. And I didn't really see that far because that was the foot of my bed. And it just kind of would creep towards me slowly. And I can remember its movement was very fluid, almost like it was just like sliding towards me like on a rope or something, you know. I don't recall it ever doing anything. But I do remember as it got close enough, I could see the door. And I always slept with my door open. And just before it got to where it was that point where your body knows there's no escape, I was able to just lunge up and head out the door. It would almost reach me. I could feel its presence. And I would just that split second I would make it, I'd run out into the living room, I'd run across the hall and I would head to my parents room at that point, I mean, it was bad, but I can remember it happening multiple times over multiple nights. And it was always the same way. Always came in through that window. And it wasn't like it would do anything, but it had that presence of pure evil or pure mystery. And I never wanted to get it any closer to me. I can remember my dad, when he finished my room, we were putting the door on and he put the doorknob on and he said, I'm gonna put the lock on the outside because I don't want me being inside the room and locking my door and having Something happen. So I always remember the lock was on the outside. I could say this. After about a week of this, maybe more, I finally had enough and I locked my room and I barricaded it and I went out in the living room and I slept on the couch for almost as far as I can remember. It felt like two weeks, three weeks. I can remember my cousins sleeping over my house and we would lay in the living room and watch that hallway towards my bedroom and just wait at night for something to come out. It never did. But the reason why it's so mysterious to me now is because I bought the house that I grew up in from my parents. And that room, we put that dividing wall back up and that additional 8 foot by 10 foot room is now used as just a day room for things. And the other room that was part of my bedroom is my son's room. And he sleeps in there. And what's Disturbing is now 20 some years later, he has had two encounters where he's told me that something has come out of his open closet. His closet has no doors, it's just an open bookshelf with closet, hanging rack. And he said one time something came out and it was a dark figure and it scared him. And I came in. We have a video monitor that keeps an eye on him at night and there was nothing there. And the second time he said something was standing at the foot of his bed and it was wearing a hat, it was a dark figure wearing a hat. And that hit me. It almost floored me at work. I was standing there and I heard one of your callers from possibly season five or six, and I'm sure it's come up again. But that dark figure wearing a hat. The hat man. But that was my story. I love the podcasts. Keep up the work, all that jazz.

And my story happened in 2012. Kind of sad story, but my sister was dying of cancer and I was up probably 4 hour trip away to visit her her last days. I got there the day before she passed away. Anyway, she still could hear and chat a little bit. And then the very next day my other sister and I were there and she passed away. So when I left, finally I got out in my car, which was a brand new car, relatively new, maybe a year old. And I always had listened to the radio, but when I started my car, I got this static, just total static. And I thought, well, this is strange. Why is all this static? It just, I couldn't tune anything in. Well, eventually when I got going, I could listen to the radio music again and stuff. And on my trip home, of course, she was on my mind the whole time. And I pull up in my driveway and I live on a farm and to my left is the house and there's a porch, and it was an unfinished porch at the time. And she was standing there waving at me. And I knew it was her because she had this tie dye T shirt that she loved to wear. And it just totally caught my eye. And then I was looking up the driveway again and then I looked again and she was gone. I truly believe that her spirit or her energy was in the car with me. When I started the car and the radio gave me all kinds of static, I think that was her spirit or her energy, I guess. And she came all the way home with me and waved goodbye to me on my porch. That's my story. Keep it spooky.

So the reason I wanted to send this in is because I always hear people call in with sleep paralysis stories and they all sound very similar. And mine is. I feel like a play on that almost, but with a different experience. And I haven't heard anybody share a similar experience to mine, so I figured I'd pass it along. Full Disclosure of the night this happened to me I had been drinking a little bit, and I know that you've mentioned that alcohol can bring on sleep paralysis, but again, this isn't paralysis, so it's kind of interesting. I went to sleep one night and I don't know what time it was. It was maybe a few hours or less. After I fell asleep. I all of a sudden woke up and I'm laying on my side and I'm looking, I guess towards a wall and right in front of my face all of a sudden appeared this other face that I can only describe as demonic because it was a normal human face. But it smiled at me and it had this mouth filled with really sharp teeth. Pretty much your classic monster. So this face is right in front of me and when it smiled and showed its teeth, all of a sudden my entire body felt warm. And I wasn't paralyzed. I could move, but I just chose not to. And the feeling that came over me was just pure euphoria, like I felt really good, which is the opposite feeling you would think you would get when seeing what I was looking at. And this thing just smiled at me and I just sat there and I think I even almost smiled back because of the feeling I was getting. I can only compare the feeling to morphine or something similar because I had surgery once and when I came out of surgery. I remember they had me on a morphine drip or something along the lines of morphine, because that's what the anesthesiologist told me. So anyone that's ever had morphine, it makes you feel literal warmth and euphoria just, like all over your body. And that's what I felt when this thing smiled at me with its mouth full of sharp teeth. And then as I stared at this thing for maybe five to 10 seconds, it just slowly faded out. I think I just went back to sleep and I just thought, wow, that was really interesting. And I thought, I'll tell my girlfriend about that tomorrow. She wasn't even in bed with me at the time. I was by myself. Anyway, I never forgot about it. Probably happened like maybe 15 years ago now. And I thought I'd pass it along because I just think it's a different twist on the whole sleep paralysis thing because I wasn't paralyzed. In fact, I felt amazing. Anyway, I love the show.

My name is, we'll say Mac from Indiana, and I was about 12 years old. I was at my house that my grandfather had built. One of my mom's sisters was living there. I was in the living room watching TV with her two labs beside me. All of a sudden one of the labs stood up, looking behind me. She started to show her teeth and growl. You know, you get that feeling when someone walks up behind you slowly and quietly trying to scare you. My older brother was horrible at terrifying me, so I thought it was possibly him. And so all of a sudden the other dog stands up and she Steps up on the couch with the front paws looking behind me. Also not at me, directly behind me, showing her teeth. And these are two of the most docile dogs I'd ever known. I've never seen behave like this. I turned into what I would consider like the blob. I just slid off the couch, into the floor, rolled. I played sports and I dove into the kitchen onto a freshly waxed floor and picked up speed and slid head first into the kitchen cabinet. My aunt jumped up. I scared her. And the dogs were sliding right behind me. I told him what I'd experienced. My mom laughed at me and my aunt laughed at me. Anyway, thank you very much.

This is not my story, but my brother's story. This is in Michigan, outside Bangor. Essentially, my brother and my sister were both at home. Civil light trailer. My dad made some modifications to it. Essentially, my brother's washing dishes in the kitchen. He's facing out and away from the hallway that connects to the other two bedrooms in the bathroom. Basically, the hallway is behind him and to his right. He's doing the dishes, looking out, and my sister comes out, says, hey, I'm gonna go down the street and help the neighbor with their animals. He's like, okay. And it's a while later when he's continuing to do the dishes when from the hallway, he hears, christian, come here. And he goes, no, you come here. My hands are wet. I'm doing dishes. Christian, come here. And from what I remember, this goes back and forth for a second before the realization hits him that she's not back there. She's over at the neighbors helping them with their animals. And he freaks out, you know, gets the hell out of here and goes down to the neighbors to confirm that she's actually over there. Good show. I honestly hope to hear this while I'm at work someday.

But where this happened was in northern Chicagoland suburbs. And I grew up in a really spooky, creepy house. And there was always a lot of stuff going on. But one specific memory that I have from that house is I was about 16 years old and me and my friends were all hanging out in the basement, which is where the ghosts like to hang out and turn on water and stuff like that. But me and my friends were all just having a sleepover, having a really good time. And then all of a sudden we like laughed at a joke really hard. And then we heard another laugh in the corner of the room. And me and my best friend looked at each other and we were like, whoa, did you hear that extra laugh, like in the corner? And we're like 28 now. So this is like 12 years ago. And we still like to this day talk about it and how creepy it was and how we like knew something else was there and we ended up just like leaving all our friends down there and then sleeping upstairs.

Tonight I wanted to tell you about my UFO sightings. The first one was I was about 10 years old and my mom used to put all our clean clothes in this back bedroom and there was a window there. Then we'd have to find our clothes to get ready for school. And I was just kind of looking out the window. It was cloudy and at that time it was in the 60s I believe that they were having these sightings of UFOs off of Lake Michigan that they said were metal and cigar shaped. So I'm looking and I see this metal object. It was long, cigar shaped and metallic. It was pretty shiny and it was going in and out of the clouds like it dropped down and then it moved around and then zip. It was going really Fast. And there wasn't at that time a helicopter that I ever heard of that could go that fast. Plus, I didn't see any kind of propellant on it or wings or anything. So I was staring at it, and my mom came marching in, wondering what was taking me so long. And I pointed out to her. So we stood and watched it for a while. And it just zipped in and out of clouds and rise up and disappear and then pop down again, move around, zipping around, and then go back in the clouds. So that's the first sighting. And the second one, it was, I believe, in maybe 78, 79, I'm not sure exactly. And we were staying at my aunt's farm out in Iowa just for a couple weeks. So she liked a stargaze. And she lived way out in the country, so you could really see the stars and everything. And so my aunt, my mom, me, my great aunt, and my sister all walked out down the dirt road. My aunt wanted to listen to coyotes because it was going to be a full moon. So we walk out there, and we didn't see any coyotes, but there was the moon. And as we were walking, we glanced up at it. Then we noticed how orange it was. It was this brilliant, dark, deep orange. You know, when the moon's rising, how massive it is. So we were admiring that, and then I started thinking, there's no face on it. And then I realized the moon is over there. And I said, that's not the moon. And we all looked at it. And all of a sudden it just zipped back almost to the horizon behind some trees. It was still low. It was so massive, the trees were silhouetted in front of it there. And then as we continued to watch it, it just zoomed over the horizon. It was gone. We just stood there for a long time. And my sister started coming that Twilight Zone tune. And we stared at, you know, where it had gone to. And none of us said anything after that. We just all walked back to my aunt's house. Nobody ever said anything about it again. It was just the strangest thing. And years later, I mentioned to my sister, and she doesn't remember it. And of course, all the other people where they were elderly in the first place, they passed on. So anyway, I ran into some friends right after when we got home. And they said that at that same time, she lived near that Mississippi River. And on the other side of the river, there was a cop who was following this orange orb for quite some time. And then it passed over the Mississippi. And I had Heard that there was a woman who started a UFO project study years ago at some university. And that's what got her started was seeing these orange orbs in Iowa around that time period. And I never did call her. I just thought the whole thing was just something I didn't even want to talk about at the time. But anyway, I wanted to unload it on you and thanks for your podcast. I'm enjoying it.

So it was all in the 80s. The first thing I remember was like, I don't know, it had to have been like mid-80s at the earliest, like 84. I was like a toddler. My dad woke me up, he was screaming at the doorway. Something was gonna get us. It had a net, it was gonna get us. And my mom talked him down and I didn't really understand what was going on. But she was like, bart, you know, chill out, chill out, there's nothing there. Anyway. He seemed to think something was going to get us. And to me it made no sense or no difference. I was just afraid of his reaction. But years later kind of made sense after that. The second incident I woke up, I thought was in my bed. I don't know. At the time I was under depression. I was in my bed and there was a tickling on my left leg. And I'll send a picture of it. I'm in construction. I own a construction company. I've been shocked a lot of times. And it was similar to a low voltage shock if someone put low voltage on your leg. It was my left leg on my left thigh. It was similar to that but not the same. It was less aggressive and it was more of a tickle. And I woke up at the tickle and I scratched at it and didn't go away, and I went back to sleep, and that agitated me. Scratch at it again, and it still didn't go away. So that's when I woke up. Actually, this is the most vivid memory of all this. I suddenly realized that there was something or somebody next to me, like, right next to me, doing something to my leg. At which point I was terrified. The horror and the terror was beyond belief. My heart was beating out of my chest and I didn't know what to do. So I kind of, like, faked that I was asleep and then I ignored it briefly. But at the same time, I, like, cracked an eye. Like the left eye, which is where the tickling, because it's on my left. You ever have someone stand next to you and you can feel them moving? You can hear them moving? It's pretty obvious. And then I cracked an eye, and I could see there was actually something to go along with the movements and the sounds. So I closed my eyes and I was so scared. I could tell it wasn't human right away. Right off the rip, I could tell it wasn't human. I was moving. I'll have you know. I know you guys do a lot of sleep paralysis. I've never had that. And this, certainly I could move. I could have sat up if I wanted to. I know I could have. I just played dead. Basically, when I woke up in the morning and it was summertime, anytime there's incidents that happen, it was always summertime. I woke up and I was like, man, oh, thank God that was a dream. Because it went straight from that to like, boom, you're awake. And then. Anyway, let's skip to the next thing. So probably a year later, I had weird dreams, and then I woke up and I tried to get out of the bed and I fell down. The doctor told me I had flu in my legs, which I had no idea what that meant. My mom told me that I was faking it, but the doctor was like, he has flu in his legs. Because maybe I had a fever, but I got out of my bed, fell down, and couldn't walk for, like, two or three days properly. I could walk, but I couldn't walk, like, properly. But a previous caller of yours, he called in and said he thought he'd had, like, an abduction experience and they couldn't walk. I was like, what? That's the same thing I experienced. It's one of the motivators for me calling in. So let's move on to the next episode. So my parents used to party a lot it was the 80s. We grew up in the country. You know, it was hillbilly culture. Hate to say it, but that's what it was. My parents like to go out and party. They leave us home. But my brother was, like, four years older, and I'd be nine. He'd be 13. And this memory is weird. It's through a haze. The previous memories were very clear. This memory is through a haze. My parents woke me up, and there was a kind of like a fog. It felt like. And they're like, spencer, wake up. We want you to meet someone. We met. He's a doctor. He wants to meet you. And I'm like, why? I'm tired. I want to sleep. They're like, no, you got to meet him. So this little guy comes in. He's wearing brown glasses. He's got brown hair. He's got, like, a light brown shirt. He's got khakis, you know, like Dockers. They call him the brown man. And he sits down, he just kind of looks me over, and he's like, I just want to make sure you okay from last time. Are you okay? And I was like, fine. I didn't know what he was talking about. Literally had no idea what he was talking about. My parents just stood in the background. It was a very discombobulated memory. It was weird. Everyone seemed very short, especially the doctor. Like, he was my size, and I was like 7 or 8. Anyway, so throughout the years, I disregarded all this. You know, I never thought about any of. Wasn't until I was, like, 27, and I was at my nephew's first birthday party, and my older cousin showed up, and they're like 10, 12 years older than me, and they're like, do you remember the red ufo? Heather is my sister. And she's like, no, he wasn't there. He was at grandpa and grandma's, which I would go to grandpa and grandma's all the time because I felt safe there. I did not feel safe in my house. My house gave me, like, ptsd. I felt like somebody was constantly tormenting me at that place. And they're like, oh, my God, Spencer, you didn't know about this? And I'm like, heather, why didn't you tell me? She said, well, no one wanted to tell you because you said weird stuff all the time anyway about these things. And they went on to tell me this story that. So my cousin Jennifer was next door, which was my aunt and uncle's house. She was babysitting my cousin. And then my other older cousin Jolene girl was watching my brother and sister and a giant red light was hovering over her house. So Jolene, my brother and sister fled my house literally under a ufo, ran to the next door house and everyone hid in my aunt and uncle's house until this thing went away. Nobody told me until I was 27. And once they told me that, then I kind of started putting the pieces together and I was like, maybe all this was real. Anyway, love the show. That's my story.

So this happened in the fall of 2021 in Borrego Springs. My sister had invited me to go with her two children to go see the metal statues that they have over there of animals and dinosaurs. We drove around the town and took pictures and everything like that. And at dusk, we were at the dinosaur area on the outskirts of Borrego Springs, and we had to use the bathroom, and we were hungry, so we went to this restaurant, which I'm not going to say which one it is. My sister parked the car and she went ahead of me with my niece, and I was with my nephew, who walked really slow. And we walked through the outside eating area. It was packed. So while we were walking through this crowd of people that were eating, they all stared at us, all of them, at the same time. And this is the weird part, also, it was already dark. Like, the sun had already set. It was just a little bit of orange on the mountain range. And so all of them were wearing sunglasses. Derek, this is the weirdest thing I've ever seen. I'm like, why are they wearing sunglasses? It's dark. Yeah, there was lights outside in the patio, but I'm like, we're still dim. Okay, whatever. Like I said, I was agitated that they were all looking at us. I'm like, you guys have no shame. Okay, whatever. Like, the whole time we're walking through, and even in the restaurant, it was weird. I noticed that the employees were very nervous and kind of distracted. They didn't even acknowledge us. They didn't acknowledge anybody that went through. Even people that were picking up their takeout, they were not really paying attention to them. And I noticed that the servers were taking out the same dish, which was samosas, but it was just, like, one samosa, a plate, which I'm like, okay, well, that's weird. Like, that was the only thing that was being taken out. And I'm like, okay, whatever. We did use a restroom, luckily. So we were waiting for someone to give us, you know, a table, but no one did. And my sister did finally go up to the hostess, and the hostess basically snapped at my sister, which I thought was uncalled for. And I got mad and I didn't want to upset them any longer. They seemed upset already, so I didn't want to say anything about that. So we decided to leave. At least we got to use the restroom. But yeah, there these people out in the eating area, they were wearing sunglasses at night. They all look the same, actually, even though they were closed, they all looked the same. I thought it was really weird. And the employees inside the restaurant were also acting a little peculiar. So I'm like, okay, what's going on here? On the way back home, I was reliving this stuff and so I got this feeling that the people outside, they work together. And this weird, crazy thought came in my head. I'm like, oh, maybe they work underground. And underground bases in the mountain range and the Santa Rosa Mountains. That's between me, where I live now and Borrego Springs. So I would like to know what you think about that. Have a good day.

Small little town up there south of Kansas City. When I was in second grade, maybe six, seven and around there, I remember specifically, like, having a dream where I was on a cruise ship and it basically sunk sideways close enough to an island where it was, you know, half in the water, half out of the water. And I was living with my mother and my stepfather at the time. And I remember maybe a day or two later Waking up and going into the living room and seeing they had news on. And on the news, they were reporting that a cruise ship. I can't remember what the name was, but I think here recently, they just resurfaced it or something, and that it was basically almost exactly like, how my dream was, like, to a T, the cruise ship basically sunk sideways. And after it was out of the water, laptop was completely under. So I had a dream like that. And I also had, like, a bunch of instances where I'll say something like, without any knowledge of, like, it existing. When I was a kid, like, I remember thinking that it would be cool if, like, you know, some of the Avengers had kids and, like, they had their own custom superpowers and stuff. And then I remember seeing the movie with that exact concept, like, maybe a week later. And when I was a kid also, there's a behavioral health place here in Missouri called Heartland for, like, kids and stuff that are, like, misbehaving and stuff. And I was put in there a couple of times when I was a kid. And I remember they had a fire, and there's a cemetery, like, just outside of it, like, area. And it's, like, all for that facility. And it used to have, like, a bunch of nuns and stuff in it. And I remember when I was in there that we had a fire drill and they had these, like, bay padded rooms with a door that, like, locked electronically. And it was open because no one was using that, like, area we were in. And we were all talking with the staff, and it slammed shut by itself. And there was another time I was in that same one when it was being used when I was even younger. And we were looking out and you could see, like, up on this, like, little walkway balcony that had glass all over it, and there was no one else there. And me and, like, two other kids saw, like, this lady in white kind of staring out the window at us. And when we went to go get a staff member to see it, the staff member came over, she was gone. And all the doors there were, like, specifically locked so only staff members could get to and from out of them. Love your podcast. I'm on Patreon with you. Keep up what you're doing. Love it all.

I grew up near Buffalo, near Niagara Falls there. And so to give you a little background, I used to go to Canada with my father, fishing in the very remote northern Canadian forest, the largest uninterrupted forest on the planet. So if you leave Buffalo and you go up to Toronto, then we would go another 10 hours north of Toronto, and if anybody looks at a map, it's quite remote. And then we would get up to this place and we would take about 60 miles of dirt road back into this sort of chain of lakes. Not unusual to fish up there for a week and never see anybody if you want to look on a map and see where Timmins, Ontario is, we would be about an hour and a half or two hours from there. So I started going there when I was very young. My dad and I would go several times a year and have been going up there most of my life as I got older. And, you know, my dad would go certain times and I would go certain times. And one time my dad came back and he goes, you're not going to believe what I saw. I saw a black panther cross the dirt road in front of the car when we were driving in. And when you're on the dirt road, you know, you're only doing maybe 30, 35 miles an hour. And of course, being in that Canadian wilderness a lot and being very outdoorsy, my dad absolutely knew that it was a black cat, you know, like a mountain lion. And he said, yep, it was a black panther. He called it a panther and crossed the road right in front of us. I was like, wow. I was fascinated. So years later, this is kind of a dual story on Cryptids. A friend of mine and I were up there camping, and it was in sort of early October, and about 2 o' clock in the morning, we were camping in a tent and got woken out of a dead sleep to this horrible roar, like a human being roaring at a volume that a human could never yell at. We're sort of camped in this river valley that's about maybe a mile or two miles across the. And sort of goes for about 10 miles. And whatever it was that was roaring filled the entire valley with this roar. Unbelievable roar. We were terrified. It was, of course, two o' clock in the morning. We were terrified. It went on for about 20 or 30 minutes. My buddy and I were, you know, in this seemingly little tent that just. It lit up the entire river valley. When I got home, I listened to some Bigfoot or sasquatch videos on YouTube and actually was able to find that sound. Exactly. So I still go up there and I've never heard it again, but I'm pretty sure that I may have run across one of our Bigfoot friends. So, hey, thanks so much for your podcast.

Didn't know this, and here's the reason why. From 1994 to 2008, my parents and I lived on 10 acres in East Texas. And you know, it's very wilderness area. And we lived on a particular hunting land because my dad and I were avid hunters and we encountered a Black panther family. Essentially, go freak with me. That somewhere packed away is actually a picture of me with a panther's cub. And I remember trying to debunk what I saw the very first time I encountered it because my high school, their mascot was Black Panther. So I figured, you know, oh, it's just one of the teenagers, Joseph and mascot outfit playing a prank on us. But like I said, we're avid hunters. And my dad and I wound up shooting a deer across the creek bed from where we were at. We climbed down in there. It was like about, I want to say, since the sun was going down, it was probably around 8:30 at night at that time. And we climbed down the creek bed, start climbing up the other side. And my dad told me non verbally to stop where I was at because there was something moving. And we heard this really low grumble, kind of like a growl, but like a predatory stalking sound. And as we peek over the top of the ridge, all we see is this huge pure black cat. It's stalking our kills. And that's, you know, my very first encounter. And I'm like, okay, well, you know, that's just not a thing. There's no way that any cat gets vaccinated. But when my dad caught his rifle, it turned to him and just clear as day, you could see the whiskers and like the reflective iris of this cat was kind of like a glowing greenish yellow and it had lids for pupils. So obviously an animal, obviously cat in nature. And you know, we're just staring this thing down and it's staring us down. We're just trying to figure it all out. So my dad, you know, tells me to go back to the other side of the creek bed. We go back up to the truck and we start discussing this cat. And a couple of our neighbors said, you know, maybe it was a Bob's cat. Well, I know what a bobcat looks like. We killed one trying to protect ourselves in the hills of Arizona. So a couple years later, we're hunting again. And I'm laying in a brush trying to create kind of a homemade ghillie suit. And my dad is sitting in a tree stand and he like, nature calls to me and tells me, don't move. And I'm like, okay, why? You know, and I slowly roll over directly above me Laying on a branch is the same panther. And it, like, looked down at me and I could see his, I want to say fangs, but that seems kind of weird. They were large cat teeth with very, very pronounced fangs in the fry. And it just kind of gave off like a cat hisses at you when it letting you know that, hey, you're messing up. And then kind of like arched up a little bit and my dad fired a warning shot. My dad shot the branch underneath this thing and it jumped and just clean out of sight in no time, flash. Like, I didn't even have a chance to react to it. So going on to why I just thought this was a normal critter is because the following three summers in a row, we had come across kind of like a. A nesting area, so to speak. It was laid flat. We thought it was like a deer nesting until we came up, you know, preparing for the hunting season and heard the low grumble of like, the predatory, hey, you're getting too close. Hound again. And we paused, and staring at us from the edge of this nesting area was those bright, yellowish green eyes glaring at us. So my dad and I had this plan to kind of like a peace offering with this large cat. We went and got very thick cut steaks from our local butcher and we brought it out to the nesting area. You know, like I said, three summers in a row we did this, just kind of a peace offering to say, hey, we're gonna go hunting, but here's our peace offering. We won't mess with you if you don't mess with us. And took these stakes out, like, tossed it into the nesting area. And about August that year, this would have been 2007. I want to say it was weird. We threw out the stakes and three cubs, like the biggest kittens I've ever seen in my life, just come trotting out towards us and start gnawing on these raw steaks that we had just thrown out. And the essentially, I'm assuming, mother just comes out and kind of like stays back, but lets them eat while we stay on the other side of this nesting area. And I was always taught when it comes to unknown animals that, like, you're supposed to present yourself without harm, without attempt to harm. So I place my hand flat on the ground and I got down on my knees in front of them and like, laid out my hands for them to sniff, I guess. And one of the cubs come over and sniffs me, licks his paw, and then, like, licks my hand and I got to pet it and My dad, you know, early 2000s era, uses a wind up camera and snaps a picture of me and mama panther over there. Was not happening. Instantly like roared at us and pretty sure I peed myself. But we instantly backed away off another steak that we had and the following year or so later we moved to a larger property on the other side of the town and I hadn't seen it again but our neighbor called us and was like, hey man, what's up with that huge ass cat? So yeah, that's why I thought cancers were just normal. Thanks man, I appreciate the podcast and I hope things continue really well for you.

I'm calling from Northern California in the mountains. I am calling in response to your episode about Shadow People. I didn't realize that other People had experienced what I had until listening to this podcast. So I wanted to talk about something that happened to me about a year ago when I had moved in with my now husband last fall. He immediately had to go work out of town, about two hours away. And so we had started our relationship. We had started our newlywed ship, and I was staying in his house by myself. Let me just also preface by saying that I see and sense entities, spirits, just what have you. I have my whole life. And that's just to say why I show a lack of fear later on.\n\n[Speaker E] In this story that I'm telling you.\n\n[Speaker D] So a little less than a year ago, I was staying in this house by myself. It was snowing outside. I was pretty vigilant, you know, wanting to protect myself. Even though we live in a small mountain town, it's like less than 2,000 people. But I had this occasion where I woke up in the middle of the night, which honestly isn't rare for me at all. I woke up at around three in the morning, and I stood up in bed because there's this figure sitting at the edge of my bed. And I could tell it was a female figure. She was wearing a cloak. And it was a white cloak, but it wasn't regular white. It wasn't even quite opalescent. It was like the way the moon shines. It reminds me of a story recently that I listened to on this podcast about a person who had seen a cloaked figure on the subway whose cloak was the cosmos. This kind of reminded me of that. So anyways, I see this cloaked figure at the edge of my bed, and I sit up in the middle of the night and I feel a sense of calm, I feel a sense of peace. But I feel something else to my right side, which, by the way, the bed is set so that the head of the bed is in line with the doorway to go into the bedroom. And I feel a presence to my right. And it's like a man above the doorway who's crouched down on all fours and his bottom is backed up to the ceiling. His hands are clutched above the door frame like the top of the door frame. And he's wearing a bowler's cap and.\n\n[Speaker F] What looks like a suit.\n\n[Speaker D] And he's kind of like banging his head repetitively. And I'm sitting up in bed and I'm just kind of watching him for.\n\n[Speaker F] Like a couple seconds.\n\n[Speaker D] And like I said, I'm kind of used to seeing this sort of thing. And I just kind of knew because he was a silhouette. So Obviously, if I turn on the lights, he's going to go away. And mind you, you know, I'm very open minded. I like to look at myself as someone who's a believer but who wants to be a skeptic, which is kind of the opposite of what I hear from people who call in. A lot of people are skeptics but want to be believers.\n\n[Speaker F] I appreciate that.\n\n[Speaker D] I'm a little bit of the opposite though. So, you know, I'm open to the fact that maybe I sat in bed a little bit in the middle of the night. Maybe I was still dreaming, maybe I was still a bit in my dream state. Maybe I was hallucinating, you know, if anything, I'm more scared of real people than entities, you know. So I sit up in bed, I turn on the light, he goes away. But what strikes me as interesting is it took me a little bit to realize that a few years ago in my journal entries, I journal quite a bit that I have actually seen this figure before in a dream. I'm also someone who lucid dreams quite a bit. It's just something that I've always been able to do. And about six years ago I had this dream and it was a lucid dream and it was really pretty. I was in a house, but I knew that it was haunted. And I realized that I was dreaming. And as I'm ascending up the stairs of the house, gravity becomes less and less relevant. So I'm ascending up the stairs and I'm kind of flying. I realize that I could float at that point. And I go up to the rooftop of the house, and the rooftop of this house, there's like a sunset scape of pinks and oranges and all that sort of thing. But it also looks like a bunch of debris from something like a tornado. And I see this figure off in the distance. He looks like he's wearing some sort of a hat, maybe some sort of a suit. I don't even know, but I feel safe. So I'm on top of this roof fixture and he's kind of catching different pieces of debris in the sky to make his way towards me. I could tell he wanted to talk to me, and I felt like he wanted to impart some sort of wisdom. And I'm looking back in my journal on January 13th of 2018, and it says that I had an intense dream before I woke up where I was in a severely haunted house. Everything was haunted. There was a man, he was otherworldly. He had shades over his eyes. He managed to hop, skip and surf a shard of wood onto the rooftop with me with one other person. It was someone I know who was with me, but I can't remember who. The man peered through our eyes into our souls, and I can't fully describe because I felt at ease with him, but it felt like he was collecting souls, but like in a calm and peaceful way, almost like a grim reaper, where it was like he was just doing it when it was in their time, you know? And then he came up upon the rooftop with me, and he takes his shades off, and this is where it reminds me of the shadow people stories I've heard on your podcast, because other people have said that they're shadow people who have red eyes. I saw this person. He had a bowler's cap, he had a tie. He had, like, a blazer of some sort. And his eyes were like red swirls or vortexes, if you will. And it just felt like he had some sort of wisdom to impart to me. And he told me, and I'm reading from my journal, he says, ah, yes, you are aware of your mistake. You are happy now. Well done. Ah, yes, you were in denial, but you know this now, and you are moving on. And then he let out an accomplished sigh and he removed his shades, revealing those crazy swirling spirals atop the whites of his eyes. And he was grinning. And let me tell you that this dream stuck out to me so much that I took it to therapy and I told my therapist to be it. I drew pictures about it because I felt like the dream had something to tell me. Needless to say, I can't help but connect that weird sort of lucid dream that I had, however many years ago, to waking up in the middle of the night this last year, during last winter, where I felt like I encountered a spiritual presence. But what inspired me to call in was that other people have had this sort of experience, experience too. And I had no idea. I just thought, like, well, you know, maybe I'm hallucinating or dreaming or whatever. But, yeah, I don't know. I'm a believer, but I'm open to being a skeptic, so I would love to hear what other people's experiences are. Thank you so much for what you do. Thank you for your team. Thank you for your community. I appreciate you.

I don't know if it's connected but about a year before I stopped over the road driving, I lost my brother to a bad staph infection. He was living down in Dallas at the time and back home in Oklahoma now. We grew up in a house that I'm currently living in. And he had moved down to Dallas. Mom moved down there with him to be with him. He had had some surgery done, and he had died from a really bad staph infection that was caught too late. And then just later that summer, say about six months later, I lost my mom. And about that time is when I came home, you know, pretty much for good. I started to notice some things around the house. My wife had always told me she's sensitive, and she's noticed that we've had a little trickster spirit, I guess you could say, that's been playing around in the house some. But the thing that's really been spooking me is that about three months after my mom passed, and my mom's always. She's always hated dogs, you know, And I'm totally the opposite. Love dogs. They're like our fur kids. And I don't know if this is her stirring stuff up. I really don't want to say it is, but I sometimes Wonder. But about 2:30, and it's not all the time. It's like maybe once or twice a week, about 2:30 in the morning to about 3, I wake up because the dogs are going nuts, and they're always facing toward the living room. And I'll start walking around and making sure everything's okay. And every time I walk in to the living room, the TV is on and we've shut it off. It's smart TV that, you know, when it comes time to get ready to go to bed, we always set the timer so that way if we doze off, it'll shut off and, you know, we'll notice that and we'll drag our rear ends to bed. But it always seems like if there's a little too much stress going on, I don't know if that could be it or doing it. But, you know, the TV will come on, even the computer monitor will come on. And we've got that in the living room as well. And they're on two separate electrical circuit, so I know it's not a power surge doing it. And my oldest son, he lives with us still. We both work at the same place and he's noticed it as well. It's always when the dogs just go completely nuts, like somebody's wandering around. So don't know if it's mom still aggravating the dogs because she don't like them, it's always weird. It's just one of those weird things. And we've had two different TVs in living room since I've been home. And there's always something turning it on. So I don't know, sometimes it'll be on full volume. Other times it's just on and quiet, like it's muted. So I don't know if that's mom still doing that or if it's that little trickster. But we've got a little friend there. And sometimes we do catch the little ghost. It's a little girl. Sometimes I still see that little girl out of the corner of my eye in her little outfit. She's got like a little blue jumper on, a white blouse, kind of sandy blondish hair. And we've been in that house since 1980. So I don't know anything of the history prior anybody has lost a child there. But I do notice that since mom passed, she stays in the hallway. She won't come out of the hallway because she used to run. You know, we'd catch her different various places of the house. But since mom passed, she's not coming out. So I don't know. That's just one of those creepy things. I had been talking to a friend about it and he popped the question. Especially as you're dealing with my wife being sensitive. And if she's caught any of this. And I have asked her, and she has, but she's of that train of thought that you don't cleanse your own home. You have another sensitive come in to do it. It's some kind of belief that she has from growing up because apparently there's a line of this and her family. But she said she would do it if they ended up harming any of our animals or any of us. But there's nothing. It's just like playing tricks on us and such. So that's just kind of what's been going on. And I kind of wonder if anybody else has got something like this going. So really love the show. Appreciate everything you do for us out here. And it really makes the day or evening, whenever I'm working, to go by quicker. Keep up the great work.

I have experienced quite a few spooky things in my lifetime. However, I wanted to share some of the scariest things I've ever experienced revolving around the house I used to live in. So we moved into this house when my oldest daughter was 2 years old and didn't experience anything. It was a house that was built in the late 80s. There had been no deaths or anything there. Didn't feel anything weird, nothing. And that was in 2009. And then my second daughter was born three years after my first daughter and still nothing. Nothing. And then things started getting weird. When she was about a toddler, I would walk into her room and see her, you know, playing. And she was about 2 years old, and she'd be talking to somebody and I would say, oh, who are you talking to? Oh, I'm just playing with Nana. And Nana is my mother in law who passed away several years before she was even born. We hadn't really ever brought Nana up to her yet because she was so young. We didn't think she would understand that she had a grandmother who had passed away. So I was like, well, that's pretty weird. And she talked about Nana quite a bit. She didn't describe her, which I thought was odd. But then I thought, okay, well, hey, if she's hanging out with her deceased grandmother, I mean, there's nothing wrong with that. Actually pretty heartwarming. But then things kind of got weirder as she got older. She started talking about the bad man in her closet. And every single night she would scream and scream until we would come into her room. This was like after we had put her to bed, I come in and she would say, the bad man's in my closet. The bad man's in my closet. He's coming out. And I would look, obviously I would see nothing. I'm thinking, okay, this felt, you know, kind of an overactive imagination. But I started thinking in the back of my head, like, this is pretty creepy. This is really weird. You know, little, little kids talking about bad men in their closets. Every single night is scary. So we started doing this thing where I would spray this monster spray. You know, it was literally like body spray from Bath and Body Works. But she thought it was monster spray. And I would spray and say, there, the monster's all gone, whatever. But she would wake up in the middle of the night screaming about the bad man in her closet. And finally asked her to, like, can you please describe him to me? She said, he's a tall man, he's very dark, like everything. His clothes were all dark, all black, and he had a hat. I'm like, oh, God, the hat man. Like, I've had experience with that. That's a different story. So I'm thinking, well, this isn't very great. I didn't know what to do. And I just told her, you know, you can always just come in, run in with me in the middle of the night if you're scared. Which ended up being an every single night occurrence. Well, it got to the point when she was about five or six. And weird things started happening out in the rest of the house. One morning, my husband called me at work. I went to work really early, like 6:30 in the morning, right? He called me about 6:45, and he said, are you at home? I'm like, I'm at work. He said, well, I just heard this really loud noise. I thought you fell down the stairs. I jumped straight up out of bed, ran out there, couldn't find you. I had these, maybe we call them like file boxes up the side of the stairs, and I had magazines in them. And they were pushed clear up against the wall. They were pretty heavy. You know, they had a good, you know, 20 magazines in each of them. There's probably about seven of them up, you know, the stairs pushed straight up against the side of the wall. And what he saw was they were all at the bottom of the stairs. And I thought, well, that's weird. So I came home, you know, from work that day, and we tried to debunk it. Like, okay, you know, if we jump up and down on the landing, will they fall down the stairs? If we bang up against the wall, will they fall down the stairs? Nothing. These things were heavy, and every single one of them had shoved out from the wall at the same time and fallen down the stairs at, like, 6:45 in the morning when nobody else was up. My kids were still sleeping. My husband was still sleeping. We didn't have a pet. We thought, well, did a weird animal get in here? But all the doors were shut and locked. There was no, like, random squirrel or raccoon or something that ran in and ransacked our stairway and ran back out. So that was really weird. And then a couple days later, my husband yells out from the basement, and he's like, katie, did you pull everything down from the rafters? So I come downstairs. We used to store in the rafters in our storage laundry room. We'd put up, like, our camping equipment, like, our tents and things like that. It was pretty solid up there. Things weren't falling down just randomly. There was no way things could randomly fall down out of the rafters. But all of our camping equipment, everything that was in the rafters was on the floor. My husband was, like, legit panty. He thought that I had tried to reach something up there and just pulled everything down and left it all on the floor. Like, no, I haven't even been in this room in several days. So I don't know why all this stuff's on the floor. And again, we tried to debunk it. You know, we were, like, stomping down the stairs, banging on walls, doing whatever we could to try and get this stuff to fall on its own. Nothing. That's when we're starting to get pretty freaked out. And then things started ramping up with my daughter again. She was getting to the point where she wouldn't go in her room without the lights on, even if it was in the middle of the day, broad daylight. She was terrified. So the lights always have to be on in my room all day, all night. The bad man's coming out of my closet. The bad man will get me. So we started getting pretty scared. And then it was Mother's Day of that year, and my kids had gotten me a new sweatshirt that they knew I wanted, and so they wanted me to try it on right there. So I tried it on. All of a sudden, I feel this burning up my arm. I was like, what is that? So I kind of, like, pull the sweatshirt up on my arm, and there's these three long scratch marks, like, all the way up my right forearm. And I was like, that is weird. So I pulled the sweatshirt off, thinking, oh, there must be something inside of it that had, like, scratched me. Like, is there a tag in there or something? There was nothing. There was literally no reason. And it looked like claw marks. Like, it was three of them. And I took pictures. I still have the pictures. And I was kind of thinking, this seems a little demonic. And then that night, my oldest daughter started screaming. I ran into her room, and she said, mom, my face is burning. And there were three big claw marks down her cheek onto her neck. And again, I'm trying not to scare my kids, but I'm, like, done at this point. We started looking through her bed. You know, is there something in your bed that could have scratched your face? You know, sometimes she was a little kid, she would, like, sneak Doritos into her bed or something. You know, is there crumbs? Is there anything? There was literally nothing. And she was a kid who always, like, she really had short nails, so she didn't scratch herself, and she hadn't gone to sleep yet, so she didn't scratch herself in her sleep. Because I asked her that. Like, were you scratching your face? Did anything like that happen? She said, no, I was just literally laying here, and my face started burning, and it looked exactly the same as my arm. It was three deep red scratches on her face and her neck. And I took pictures of that, too. So after I got her calmed down, I went out into the hallway, and I kind of, like, talked out loud, being like, whatever you are, you don't mess with the wrong person. You can mess with my. My property. You can mess with me. Don't mess with my kids. You are not welcome here. You know, I just kind of went off. And then the next day, I actually called our pastor from our church, because I was like, I know this sounds crazy, but here's what's going on. What do we do? I mean, I'm not Catholic, so I can't call a priest or anything. But really soon, my preacher came over, and she was like, yeah, I believe you. Things like this are real. So she kind of, like, did a blessing on the house and holy water, and my youngest daughter was terrified to let her into her room. That's where things are happening, right? So she came in the Mustang house, and then we sold the house because I said, I'm not living here anymore with a potential demon or something that is, like, literally harming us now.\n\n[Speaker D] So we sold our house and moved.\n\n[Speaker F] Out a month later. And we have not had any issues since, except for my youngest daughter, who is now a teenager, still keeps things. She's kind of come to the realization that she's a bit of a medium or a bit of a conduit or something, because everything started when she could start, like, walking and talking. So we realized that all of this centered around her, so she's actually seen another person to try and figure out how to keep bad spirits away, how to deal with it. But anyways, that's my story revolving around our old house. I just want to say thank you for the podcast. You just thoroughly enjoy it.

I have a very, at least in my mind, credible black cat story that I wanted to share with you guys. Back in the fall of 2020, I was working a part time job reading water meters for Henry county in Alabama, more specifically the city of Abbeville. I had gotten up this one particular morning to go read the meters. I always kind of prepare myself. It was a once a month situation, so I would go to bed early the night before and usually get started right around the crack of dawn. At least get in my car and head that way. I live about 40 minutes from where I would do the work. So this particular morning it was a brisk fall morning, very clear out. I want to say it was maybe 7:15 ish in the morning, so sun had already come up. I had really good visibility. I had turned on the road that would carry me back that way just outside Eufaula, just crossing into the city limits of Abbeville. So the street that I was traveling down had really large corn. It was Grown up probably 5 or 6ft on both sides of the road. As I'm driving roughly 15 to 20 yards in front of me, I see some movement in the brush on the side of the road. Kind of catch it out the corner of my eye and out I see an animal that I can only describe as a large black cat. Take one leap from off the side of the median of the road, jump into the center line of the road and take one leap from the center line of the road into the brush on the other side of the street. So basically the cat was able to, because I guess it was running full speed at the time, able to clear the entire road in one leap. Just so you kind of have an idea why I feel so strongly that this was what it was. I'm an owner of a large Connie Corso. This dog's about 135 pounds. Whatever this cat was, I would guesstimate was at minimum size of my dog, a little larger if I had to say. And when it was outstretched in its full leaf, it had to be close from, you know, tail to front feet, roughly 8ft. It had a long tail, very muscular body. I know for certain. I saw what I saw, man.

I live right around the Myrtle beach area and we've had some bizarre things happen around here. One particular day, one of my neighbors called me over. He bought an extra lot right next to his house just to grow a nice garden. It's probably about a fifth of an acre. He called me over, says, hey, Donald, come on over here. I need you to check something out for me. He goes, I found these like strange prints out by my garden. And we walked over there and took a look at them. And they were large feline prints. They were huge. I mean, they were probably close to the size of my hand with my fingers laid out. And then there was another set of little ones. So I looked at him and said, hey, you got yourself a big cat. You know, cougar, mountain panther, whatever you want to call it, just a large cat. And he was pretty shocked about that. We kind of both had the feeling that something was watching us. It was probably around noon. It was in 2015. It was a clear day out, weather was great. It was just kind of one of those things. We were like, oh, this is kind of odd. So I just told him, I said, hey, listen, just, you know, we had a little bit of debris around where something could hide. You might want to clean that stuff up. Kind of don't make a place for this thing to hide out. And definitely don't go out by yourself at night. If you need, call me, I'll come over with you and we'll do whatever you need to do. And that was pretty much that. Well, the next day I went on Facebook on our neighborhood page, and I wanted to let everybody know, hey, just be careful, there's a large cat out here. And I don't want anybody's pets or anything else to get attacked. We got a couple responses. Some people like, ah, there's no big cat, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And then we had actually a bunch of people say that they had actually seen a large black cat cross the highway. It's called 707. It was pretty interesting. So several people had said they seen it. And then some doubters kept saying, oh, there's nothing there, there's nothing there. Well, my son was taking course lessons on an 80 acre farm, which is just right across from we live. They're building a highway called Highway 31. And I guess that displaced a lot of animals in there. A year before there was a bear. But now we're like, we asked the state and they said there's no such thing. They don't exist here. And. Okay, well, people are seeing it and there's definitely tracks there. So they refuse to even entertain the idea. And then where my son was taking his lessons, I was walking some of the trails and I found a lot of kill there. I found a lot. I found some dead coyotes that were taken down, dogs, cats, a couple of deer. It was pretty interesting, for sure. You know, I had the air in the back of my neck stand up. I personally didn't see anything. I just thought you might be interested in this because I noticed the big cat topic is something that you do talk about from time to time. Well, anyway, Derek, love the show. Keep up the good work and thank you very much for all that. You do have a great day.

My name is Gray and I am from East Central Ohio, and I wanted to tell you a story about what happened to me, me this summer. Me and my brother saw one of those alien black cats that no one can really explain. So we had been going down to check out My family's property. We rent a. I don't know, call it a campsite, probably next to a little river done by a creek. And so we had been going down to check it out, see if it had flooded in the rains that we had just had, or if it had had, like, needed to be mowed or anything. And so we were down there in the evening, I would say, and we had just finished up what we were doing there, and we were on our way back. Now, this is a little, tiny, less than a lane, really dirt road, middle of nowhere. Nearest house is probably over a mile away. A little bit of context. We live in a village, technically, and, like, population is about 400. So it's really, really secluded out there. And we are driving. Sun's not setting yet, but it's on its way. And we are just, you know, 30 miles an hour, just carefully picking our way along this really awful little gravel road. And all of a sudden, faster than fast. I'm telling you, this thing was the fastest thing we've ever seen. This massive black shape just, like, darts across the road and up the hill. And the hill on the other side of the road was dense brush, like very thick forest. It's the middle of the summer, so it's briars and it's undergrowth and everything. Nothing could have possibly gotten up that hill fast enough for us to not be able to see it whenever we tried to follow it with our eyes across the road. But as soon as it hit the other side of the road, bam, this thing is gone. So we didn't see it coming, and we didn't see it leaving. It just all of a sudden went across the road and was completely gone. Now, my family are generational, like, Appalachian granny magic kind of folks. So my brother and I immediately are like, what kind of apparition was this? And we look at each other and we're like, was that a cat? But the size of a deer. I'm telling you, it was massive. Just completely pitch black. Long black tail and moving so fast you couldn't even hardly see what it was. But we both said independently that that was a huge cat that was gone the second it crossed the road. So, like I said, my family's very into this spiritual and the paranormal and things. So I've got lots of other things that I can call and tell you. But I had just listened to an episode where several alien black cat stories were shared, so I thought I might add mine.

So I moved into the place that I'm in now 12 years ago and I had my great aunt Zona's bed frame and I had had it before this house, but I always liked it when I go to my grandmother's house. I grew up sleeping in it. It was in her guest bedroom. And then when they downsized, I got that bed frame. And I never met my great Aunt Zona. She had passed before I was born. So anyways, I moved into this new place. I got my bed all situated, I got my bedroom all situated and began living from here. It was a hard time in my life. I was a newer single mom. Stressful time, stressful divorce. And I needed to go back to school to figure out my life. And my kid at that time was a toddler or, you know, whatever three or four is. At one point during my college career, I had to commute pretty good distance. So get the kid, take myself to school, bring myself back, get the kid, make dinner, have some quality time with said kid, and, you know, do homework, make sure I have enough sleep, because I'm crazy if I don't have sleep. You know, that sort of thing. It's just hard. And so when I would lay down to bed, I would almost, almost pass right out. But before I did, I noticed, I don't know, that there was one time that I noticed it was more like kind of fading into my memory, that there was a feeling that there was something standing beside my bed, kind of at my head, just beside my side, looking down at me. And while that sounds completely horrific, terrifyingly awful, it didn't feel that way. It felt almost concerned and supportive. And although it didn't ever move or express or gesture anything, it did feel like I said. It did feel like it was listening, concerned, interested. And so right before bed, I would talk to it out loud. I'd whisper if I had my kid in the house with me. And I would just tell it what was happening for me that day. And. I don't know, everything, you know, good, bad, hard, beautiful, all the things. And at some point over the years, I mean, this went on not every single night. I may not engage with it every single night, but, you know, if I wanted to, bam, it was there. And sometimes it was there before I thought about it. I started expressing gratitude for it, even towards it, you know, I'd say, you know, thank you so much for being here. Interestingly enough, I can't explain this. I have no understanding or reference, nor have I heard about anything like this. But while it was standing beside me, it also seemed like it multiplied itself around all three sides of the bed. And each one of itself was a little more faded than the one before. So the one beside me was pretty strongly there. It was kind of like a shape or a hooded, cloaked. Not a lot of definition there and then the one beside it was a little bit lighter, a little bit faded, and then so on all the way around, until, like, you know, if there was somebody sleeping beside me, which there wasn't, but then it would hardly be over there. It didn't seem like more than one, energetically. I don't know how to explain that. It all seemed like the same being, just kind of spreading itself out, sin around the bed. I don't know if that related to my Great Aunt Zona or if it had to do with the house. I'm thinking that it might have to do with the house. So, over time, I graduated college, got a job, things got a little bit easier. At least I didn't have to do homework all the time. Just things were a little lifted, less stressful. And I've always kind of connected with my Great Aunt Zona and her sister, who was my Great Aunt Bess. And they both had passed before I was born. And I know that Great Aunt Bess wanted to meet me. She passed, actually, like, I was a month late, and Great Aunt Zona died during that time. So I just missed her, you know? So I have pictures of them in the house, and I talk to them a lot. I wouldn't say that I see them, but I just feel like they're here. I don't know. I say that because this just didn't feel like that. I guess the entity around my bed felt like it was interacting with me. Whereas when I call on my Great Aunt Bess and my Great Aunt Zona, it's more like a prayer. It's more like a feeling of prayer with them. So one day, it occurred to me that I had been kind of interacting with this entity around the house. I would start talking to it. I don't even know if it was the same entity or not, honestly. But it wasn't really around my bed so much anymore. I didn't need it to be around my bed. But one day I thought, you know, I wonder if they're stuck here in this house. Here I am, spilling my guts, and they're nice enough to listen and be supportive and compassionate, but what if they're actually stuck here? You know, what about them? So I just felt really deeply about this. All of the sudden, one day, and I sat on my bed, I pushed my door closed because my kid doesn't want to hear anything about this. It freaks him out. I started to kind of whisper, you know, in a way that my kid wouldn't hear. I'd say, if you're there, would you please come in to my bedroom. I just want to talk to you about something. And lo and behold, my bedroom door opens and I was so expecting something to happen that it didn't freak me out at all. And I just said to it, you know, everything I just said, you know, I realized that I just feel you wandering around the house. And, you know, if you happen to be locked in here in some way, I want you to know that I free you. I want you to feel free to leave this house whenever you want to. And because you seem kind, compassionate, respectful, you can come back if you want to. But just know I right now break all binds, you know, all promises, all anything that has kept you here, if indeed you are kept here so that you may leave. And when you leave, I hope that you find the most beautiful next chapter that you can possibly experience. I never felt it again. And there was a part of me that really wanted to be like, oh, wait, I miss you. But I make sure not to try to talk to that I never do, actually. And I'm actually standing right outside my front door right now because I don't want to pull back in something that I have given a choice to. If it wanted to leave, then it should go. And it did. And it was such a beautiful experience. I didn't know if it was something that you all would be interested in.

My name is James from Sydney, Australia. So my story is, well, one among many. This one goes back to November of 2011, so some 13 years ago almost. I was 16 years old at the time. And also interestingly enough, this was a week before I was going to go on a school trip overseas to Cambodia and Vietnam, interestingly enough, for two weeks. So literally a few days before I was going to fly out with my other students. It would have been about between say 9 o' clock and 9:30 at night on a weekend evening. So possibly I'd say a Saturday where I live in Sydney. To give you a bit of context, if you look at map of Sydney, it's quite a large expansive city. So for a bit of context, I live in the southeast. What's important is that where I live it's quite close to the bush, your equivalent of the forest. And we live on a ridge that overlooks a small valley that overlooks another neighboring suburb. And in between that it's all just bushland or forest, you know, it's all a valley and ridges as well. And our house is two stories with our kitchen and lounge room upstairs, not downstairs. So we have a massive panoramic view of an incredible amount of Sydney metropolitan and beyond that and of course bushland. And the other thing is to where we live, at nighttime it's very quiet and also we get to see a lot of stars. So essentially I was upstairs in the kitchen at the time, outside our kitchen window, lounge room and of course the dining area, we have a massive veranda, so like a balcony. And I was standing there just looking out the window, as I do almost any night, looking into the distance, looking up at the night sky, looking at the lights in the distance. The neighbouring suburb, whatever, looking directly from the kitchen window straight ahead, there is still currently a ridge, but also now it's residential area. This is where it gets interesting because 13 years ago, from 2010 to 2011, the entirety of the area that is now residential, connecting to the rest of our area as well. So there used to be a main road that was at one point in time an earthly road, and because of development it's gone further. And that area 13 years ago was complete dense bushland. There was no roads, there was no streets, there were no street lights. And there was no houses of course either, not even foundations for ones to be built. It was all landlords being surveyed for building residential areas. Now, one Thing I can say also because we have down in the valley tracks that are used by the rural fire brigade during the summertime of year. As you can imagine, we get bushfires in Australia just like you get forest fires in the US or in Canada or even over in Europe. There are fire trails that fire trucks use to conduct their training and their preparation for bushfire season in the summer. So, anyway, importantly to note where this ridge is back then and now, there were never any fire trails around them. And also, it's incredibly rocky, so no vehicles can drive through it so easily without falling off. So I'm standing there and I'm watching what to me was the most bizarre thing I've seen really, since forever. Pulsating blue, red and white lights belonging to something that was clearly physical. It almost opened up, is the best way I can describe. Appeared out of nowhere, and it lasted for a good maybe five minutes or so. And the best way I can describe it is it was swimming. It was meandering through the tree line in such a way that it didn't have any effect on the trees themselves. They didn't move, they didn't bend, no sound, but a very intense, bright light that would pulsate back and forth, back and forth. And at this point in time, I am utterly transfixed in what I'm seeing. So much so that I can't scream and say, hey, guys or whoever, come up and see this. Can you see what I'm seeing? And even now, 13 years later, it is still a rather bizarre thing that I saw. I don't know if it was necessarily a ufo. It certainly wasn't a drone, because drones were a thing back then. It was not a helicopter. Frankly, I would even call this thing a high aerial craft because it was so low. And it was basically, as I can, as I would say, it was meandering its way through the tree lines. So as soon as it was there, as it appeared, it quickly ended. It didn't disappear like going up into the sky, shooting up at incredible speeds. It almost like it just turned off and it was gone, never to be seen again. I don't know what you would call this. I mean, certainly by today's standards, it's a uap, Unknown Aerial Phenomena. Because this thing was not so much flying as it was more hovering. And like I said, I can distinguish between a fire truck with its lights on. And importantly, there were no tracks, no roads, no footpaths or nothing at the time in that location. Now, if you were to see it with your own eyes, you Would see houses and street lights and it's a lot more open and less trees. At this point in time, it was densely filled with trees, eucalyptus trees, like we have in Australia anyway. And of course, no tracks. That's the important part. So this thing wasn't driving, because you can clearly tell when it's on the road or on the ground and it's moving. This thing was in midair, so it was flying or hovering, but it was almost like snaking its way through. It lasted all between maybe five minutes. I have never experienced a phenomenon like that again. In 13 years, I've seen nothing of the sort. It certainly wasn't a plane, it wasn't a drone, it was on a helicopter. It absolutely was not a fire truck. It wasn't an object that was being driven as opposed to hovering and, you know, fluidly moving through the air. That's my story, and I hope it can be of use to other people who might have seen something similar to that. Any case, thank you very much.

I called about seeing two alien big cats with my mother driving down the road. Well, I'm calling back because I was talking with some co workers about seeing these cats because I was wearing a Bigfoot jacket and they asked me about it and they asked if I've ever seen anything. Well, when I mentioned the two big cats I saw, one of my co workers said he's seen them too. And he's like, my dad even has a video of it. And I was like, really? And he's like, yeah, I'll show you. And he showed me and he told me his dad was sitting on the back porch. He noticed a something moving across the lake. It was right off of Lake Murray. So he had to zoom in a little bit. And because of that, the video is a little grainy, but I'm definitely gonna send that over to you. Before seeing these big cats, I didn't even know that people had seen them in South Carolina. And then when I saw them, all of a sudden people were like, yeah, no, they exist here. It baffles me because from the research I've done, DNR had to put out a statement that said there are no big cats. The only big cats in South Carolina are bobcats. It's just like DNR says, we don't have them, but quite a few people have seen them here. It's very weird. Well, I hope you can use this. Thank you so much.

I live in Connersville, Indiana. So I've had many experiences in my 44 years, and one in particular kind of bothers me a little bit because this happened when I was 18 and I have three boys now, but at the time I only had one and he was two. He was very smart, could walk and talk in full sentences that you could understand, and was potty trained by the time he was one. And it was me, his dad, and him. We lived in a duplex. It had been an old garage that was converted into two apartments that were side by side. And we lived in the left side. It was a street on the left hand side, and then directly behind us was an alley. And then on the right side was the other apartment. And over there there was just a man and woman who lived there. They were younger, about 6, same age as us, and they worked all the time, so they were hardly ever home. So my ex's cousin had passed away under some suspicious circumstances and, you know, everybody was missing him. We'd been talking about him and a couple of weeks had went by, you know, and nobody's really saying anything. And this one day we had went through a normal routine of going to work, coming home, cooking dinner. I gave my son a bath. We stayed up for probably another hour or so and then had laid down and went to sleep. So in the middle of the night, I would say it was around two or three o' clock in the morning. I was jarred awake by a loud sound. And as soon as I opened my eyes and my brain had time to catch up, I had realized it was a cup that had fell into the bathtub downstairs. So when you walked into, this apartment was really small. It had a door in the front and A door in the back. So the door in the front off of the alley, you'd walk into, and it was the living room. And then straight across from there was a bathroom. And then to the right there was stairs that would take you upstairs. It was kind of like a loft. It was just one big room. And that's where we slept. And my son slept with us. He had his own bed, but it was big enough that it was split up. And then if you were to come in the other door, that would walk into the kitchen. And then when you walked out of the kitchen, you were in the living room. It was really small. It's, you know, half size of a garage, so it wasn't huge. So when I was jarred awake by this sound in the middle of the night, I knew that that was the sound of a cup falling in the bathtub. So when my kids were little, I would use a cup to wash their hair, you know, rinse their hair out with soap and all that so it wouldn't get in their eyes. And then I would just set that cup on the side of the tub and it would just sit there. So I had given him his bath around 7:30, 8:00 clock at night. And that cup had sat there the rest of the night until two or three in the morning when I heard it fall in the bathtub. So it had woke him up, also my ex. So we're both sitting there like, okay, that was just the cup that fell in the bathtub probably had water underneath it, and it probably slid into the tub. Not a big deal. So we go to fall back asleep and we hear all kinds of banging sounds. And my brain is telling me that it's the toilet seat lid falling down. And then another sound that I can't quite make out what it is. So we go downstairs thinking somebody has broken in. So he's walking down the steps with his nunchucks and I'm right behind him with a baseball bat. And my son's asleep in the bed upstairs. And it takes us less than a minute to clear the house to know that nobody's in there. Both doors had deadbolts on them, which were dead bolted. And the two windows that were in the living room and then the one that was in the kitchen were sliding windows, kind of like a sliding door, but when you slid it shut, there was that empty space right there. And we would just put like an equivalent of like a pull stick down in there, but not near as long, so nobody could slide the window open. So there's Absolutely no way anybody could have gotten into that. So nobody's in there. The cup's in the bathtub, the toilet seat and lid are shut, which we left up because I was the only girl in the house and my 2 year old was potty trained. But every time he went to the restroom, we wanted to make sure that that was left up so he didn't make a mess. So that was left up and had been up all day. Those both were down. And then we get into the kitchen and every single cabinet door in the kitchen is standing wide open. So we kind of just look at each other and kind of nervously laugh. And we're like, okay, we're awake. We really don't do much about it. We kind of just make a comment that his cousin who had passed a couple weeks before, his name was Scott and we called him Scotty. My son called him Uncle Cottie because he had problem with S's back then. So he would say Uncle Cotty. So we kind of just made a joke to each other that he was stopping by to say hi and trying to scare us. So we go back to bed. So then it's probably about three nights later, my ex is at work. It's the middle of the day. This is like July of 98. I don't know if I said that before, but it's a hot summer day. We're inside trying to keep cool. I'm six months pregnant with my second son. It's my day off and we're watching cartoons and my 2 year old decides he wants to go play with his dump truck and his race truck. So he goes upstairs to play with his toys and I just turn the TV down real low so I can hear him and keep an eye on him, but, you know, give him his own space. I'm sitting on my couch and it is middle of the day, but all the windows are closed and the fans going. Just keep it cool in there. And I can hear him upstairs laughing and giggling. And then I can hear him talking, but I can't make out what he's saying. So I'm just smiling because I'm happy that he's happy and he's having a good time and he can play by himself and everything's okay. And then the conversation he's having just sounds like it's more than just him. So I kind of get up and sneak up the steps, you know, one by one, going real slow, trying to listen to him. And when I kind of get up high enough to poke my head up over the floor where I can see into the bedroom. He's standing on the opposite wall, like, against the wall, and he's got his dump truck in front of him, and he has his race truck next to him, and he's bent down with his hands on his dump truck, and he's looking to his right at his other truck, and he's saying, get on your mark, get set. And then he stands up and he looks straight towards me, and he goes, oh, hi, Mommy. I'm just playing with Uncle Cotty. And I'm like, what? And he's like, yeah. We was jumping on the bed, and I jumped way, way high, and I jumped higher than he did, and we were getting ready to race, but he said he can't race because you're here now. So I have to wait till you go back downstairs. So I'm like, okay, well, let me go back downstairs. I didn't mean to bother you. So I go back to the bottom of the steps, and he ends up coming back down, and he said Uncle Cottie had to go somewhere. So he was just going to watch cartoons with me again and is telling me the whole time that he jumped on the bed with Uncle Cotti and he was racing his cars and he won. And, you know, we just have a talk, and I tell his dad when he comes home, and, you know, that's pretty much the end of that. So about two weeks later, inside of our bathroom, there's a closet, and inside that closet was the water heater. We'd come home one day, and there was water all over the floor. The water heater had busted and leaked all over the floor. And it was indoor outdoor carpet, so it wasn't really hard to clean it up. We went and got a shampooer, and we shampooed the carpet, and we cleaned it all up. And we'd end up getting it all up except for one spot. We went over it three different times, and no matter what we did, we could not get that stain to come up that was by the wall, and it was the shape of an S for Scotty is what I'm assuming. So I don't know if he just came by to play with my oldest son one more time or just to let us know he was okay. I wish I would have had the mindset to have my son ask more questions, but that's not something you think about in the moment. You're just. You kind of. You want to believe it's happening, but you can't believe it's happening. And you really don't think about anything else. So that was one of my stories. We moved probably six months later and we had other things happen, but not with Uncle Scotty anymore.

So I've had many experiences in my 44 years, and one in particular kind of bothers me a little bit because this happened when I was 18 and I have three boys now, but at the time I only had one and he was two. He was very smart, could walk and talk in full sentences that you could understand, and was potty trained by the time he was one and it was me, his dad, and him. We lived in a duplex. It had been an old garage that was converted into two apartments that were side by side. And we lived in the left side. It was a street on the left hand side, and then directly behind us was an alley. And then on the right side was the other apartment. And over there there was just a man and woman who lived there. They were younger, about same age as us, and they worked all the time, so they were hardly ever home. So my ex's cousin had passed away under some suspicious circumstances, and, you know, everybody was missing him. We'd been talking about him and a couple of weeks had went by, you know, and nobody's really saying anything. And this one day we had went through a normal routine of going to work, coming home, cooking dinner. I gave my son a bath. We stayed up for probably another hour or so and then had laid down and went to sleep. So in the middle of the night, I would say it was around two or three o' clock in the morning, I was jarred awake by a loud sound. And as soon as I opened my eyes and my brain had time to catch up, I had realized it was a cup that had fell into the bathtub downstairs. So when you walked into this apartment was really small. It had a door in the front and a door in the back. So the door in the front off of the alley you'd walk into, and it was the living room. And then straight across from there was a bathroom. And then to the right there was stairs that would take you upstairs. It was kind of like a loft. It was just one big room. And that's where we slept. And my son slept with us. He had his own bed, but it was big enough that it was split up. And then if you were to come in the other door, that would walk into the kitchen. And then when you walked out of the kitchen, you were in the living room. It was really small. It's, you know, half size of a garage, so it wasn't huge. So when I was jarred awake by this sound in the middle of the night, I knew that that was the sound of a cup falling in the bathtub. So when my kids were little, I would use a cup to wash their hair, you know, rinse their hair out with soap and all that so it wouldn't get in their eyes. And then I would just set that cup on the side of the tub and it would just sit there. So I had given him his bath around 7:30, 8:00 clock at night. And that cup had sat there the rest of the night until two or three in the morning when I heard it fall in the bathtub. So it had woke him up, also my ex. So we're both sitting there like, okay, that was just the cup that fell in the bathtub. Probably had water underneath it, and it probably slid into the tub. Not a big deal. So we go to fall back asleep and we hear all kinds of banging sounds. And my brain is telling me that it's the toilet seat lid falling down. And then another sound that I can't quite make out what it is. So we go downstairs thinking somebody has broken in. So he's walking down the steps with his nunchucks and I'm right behind him with the baseball bat. And my son's asleep in the bed upstairs. And it takes us less than a minute to clear the house to know that nobody's in there. Both doors had deadbolts on them which were dead bolted. And the two windows that were in the living room and then the one that was in the kitchen were sliding windows, kind of like a sliding door. But when you slid it shut, there was that empty space right there. And we would just put like an equivalent of like a pull stick down in there, but not near as long. So nobody could slide the window open. So there's absolutely no way anybody could have gotten into that. So nobody's in there. The cup's in the bathtub, the toilet seat and lid are shut, which we left up because I was the only girl in the house and my 2 year old was potty trained. But every time he went to the restroom, we wanted to make sure that that was left up so he didn't make a mess. So that was left up and had been up all day. Those both were down. And then we get into the kitchen and every single cabinet door in the kitchen is standing wide open. So we kind of just look at each other and kind of nervously laugh and we're like, okay, we're awake. We really don't do much about it. We kind of just make a comment that his cousin who had passed a couple weeks before, his name was Scott and we called him Scotty. My son called him Uncle Cottie because he had problem with S's back then.\n\n[Speaker F] So he would say Uncle Cotty.\n\n[Speaker E] So we kind of just made a joke to each other that he was stopping by to say hi and trying to scare us. So we go back to bed. So then it's probably about three nights later, my ex is at work. It's the middle of the day. This is like July of 98. I don't know if I said that before, but it's a hot summer day. We're inside trying to keep cool. I'm six months pregnant with my second son. It's my day off and we're watching cartoons and my 2 year old decides he wants to go play with his dump truck and his race truck. So he goes upstairs to play with his toys and I just turn the TV down real low so I can hear him and keep an eye on him, but, you know, give him his own space. I'm sitting on my couch and it is middle of the day, but all the windows are closed and the fans going just to get keep it cool in there. And I can hear him upstairs Laughing and giggling. And then I can hear him talking, but I can't make out what he's saying. So I'm just smiling because I'm happy that he's happy and he's having a good time and he can play by himself and everything's okay. And then the conversation he's having just sounds like it's more than just him. So I kind of get up and sneak up the steps, you know, one by one, going real slow, trying to listen to him. And when I kind of get up high enough to poke my head up over the floor where I can see into the bedroom, he's standing on the opposite wall, like, against the wall, and he's got his dump truck in front of him, and he has his race truck next to him, and he's bent down with his hands on his dump truck, and he's looking to his right at his other truck, and he's saying, get on your mark, get set. And then he stands up and he looks straight towards me, and he goes, oh, hi, Mommy. I'm just playing with Uncle Cotty. And I'm like, what? And he's like, yeah. We was jumping on the bed, and I jumped way, way high, and I jumped higher than he did, and we were getting ready to race, but he said he can't race because you're here now, so I have to wait till you go back downstairs. So I'm like, okay, well, let me go back downstairs. I didn't mean to bother you. So I go back to the bottom of the steps, and he ends up coming back down, and he said Uncle Cottie had to go somewhere, so he was just gonna watch cartoons with me again and is telling me the whole time that he jumped on the bed with Uncle Cottie and he was racing his cars and he won. And, you know, we just have a talk, and I tell his dad when he comes home, and, you know, that's pretty much the end of that. So about two weeks later, inside of our bathroom, there's a closet, and inside that closet was the water heater. We'd come home one day, and there was water all over the floor. The water heater had busted and leaked all over the floor. And it was indoor, outdoor carpet, so it wasn't really hard to clean it up. We went and got a shampooer, and we shampooed the carpet, and we cleaned it all up. And we'd end up getting it all up except for one spot. We went over it three different times, and no matter what we did, we could not get that stain to come up. That was by the wall and it was the shape of an S for Scotty is what I'm assuming. So I don't know if he just came by to play with my oldest son one more time or just to let us know he was okay. I wish I would have had the mindset to have my son ask more questions, but that's not something you think about in the moment. You're just. You kinda. You wanna believe it's happening, but you can't believe it's happening and you really don't think about anything else. So that was one of my stories. We moved probably six months later and we had other things happen, but not with Uncle Scotty anymore.

I have experienced quite a few spooky things in my lifetime. However, I wanted to share some of the scariest things I've ever experienced revolving around the house I used to live in. So we moved into this house when my oldest daughter was 2 years old and didn't experience anything. It was a house that was, you know, built in the late 80s. You know, there have been no deaths or anything. There didn't feel anything weird, nothing. And that was in 2009. And then my second daughter was born three years after my first daughter, and still nothing, nothing. And then things started getting weird. When she was about a toddler, I would walk into her room and see her, you know, playing. And she was about 2 years old and she'd be talking to somebody and I would say, oh, who are you talking to? Oh, I'm just playing with Nana. And Nana is my mother in law who passed away several years before she was even born. We hadn't really ever brought Nana up to her yet because she was so young. We didn't think she would understand that she had a grandmother who had passed away. So I was like, well, that's pretty weird. And she talked about Nana quite a bit. She didn't describe her, which I thought was odd. But then I thought, okay, well, hey, if she's hanging out with her deceased grandmother, I mean, there's nothing wrong with that. Actually pretty heartwarming. But then things kind of got weirder as she got older. She started talking about the bad man in her closet. And every single night she would scream and scream until we would come into her room. This was like after we had put her to bed, I come in and she would say, the bad man's in my closet, the bad man's in my closet. He's coming out. And I would look, obviously I would see nothing. I'm thinking, okay, this felt, you know, kind of an overactive imagination. But I started thinking in the back of my head, like, this is pretty creepy.\n\n[Speaker D] This is really weird.\n\n[Speaker F] You know, little, little kids talking about bad men in their closets every single night is scary. So we started doing this thing where I would spray this monster spray. You know, it was literally like body spray from Bath and Body Works. But she thought it was monster spray. Oh, they would spray and say, there, the monster's all gone, whatever. But she would wake up in the middle of the night screaming about the bad man in her closet and finally asked her to, like, can you please describe him to me. She said, he's a tall man. He's very dark, like everything. His clothes were all dark, all black, and he had a hat. I'm like, oh, God, the hat man. Like, I've had experience with that. That's a different story. So I'm thinking, well, this isn't very great. I didn't know what to do. And I just told her, you know, you can always just come in, run in with me in the middle of the night if you're scared. Which ended up being in every single night occurrence. Well, it got to the point when she was about five or six, and weird things started happening out in the rest of the house. One morning, my husband called me at work. I went to work really early, like 6:30 in the morning, right? He called me about 6:45, and he said, are you at home? I'm like, I'm at work. He said, well, I just heard this really loud noise. I thought you fell down the stairs. I jumped straight up out of bed, ran out there, couldn't find you. I had these, we call them, like, file boxes up the side of the stairs, and I had magazines in them. And they were pushed clear up against the wall. They were pretty heavy. You know, they had a good, you know, 20 magazines in each of them. There's probably about seven of them up, you know, the stairs, pushed straight up against the side of the wall. And what he saw was they were all at the bottom of the stairs. I thought, well, that's weird. So I came home, you know, from work that day, and we tried to debunk it. Like, okay, you know, if we jump up and down on the landing, will they fall down the stairs? If we bang up against the wall, will they fall down the stairs? Nothing. These things were heavy, and every single one of them had shoved out from the wall at the same time and fallen down the stairs at, like, 6:45 in the morning when nobody else was up. My kids were still sleeping. My husband was still sleeping. We didn't have a pet. We thought, well, did a weird animal get in here? But all the doors were shut and locked. There was no, like, random squirrel or raccoon or something that ran in and ransacked our stairway and ran back out. So that was really weird. And then a couple days later, my husband yelled out from the basement and was like, katie, did you pull everything down from the rafters? So I come downstairs. We used to store in the rafters in our storage laundry room. We'd put up, like, our camping Equipment, like our tents and things like that. It was pretty solid up there. Things weren't falling down just randomly. There was no way things could randomly fall down out of the rafters. But all of our camping equipment, everything that was in the rafters was on the floor. My husband was, like, legit happy. He thought that I had tried to reach something up there and just pulled everything down and left it all on the floor. Like, no, I haven't even been in this room in several days. So I don't know why all this stuff's on the floor. And again, we tried to debunk it. You know, we were, like, stomping down the stairs, banging on walls, doing whatever we could to try and get this stuff to fall on its own. Nothing. That's when we're starting to get pretty freaked out. And then things started ramping up with my daughter again. She was getting to the point where she wouldn't go in her room without the lights on, even if it was in the middle of the day, broad daylight. She was terrified. So the lights always have to be on in my room all day, all night. The bad man's coming out of my closet. The bad man will get me. So we started getting pretty scared. And then it was Mother's Day of that year, and my kids had gotten me a new sweatshirt that they knew I wanted, and so they wanted me to try it on right there. So I tried it on. All of a sudden, I feel this burning up my arm. I was like, what is that? So I kind of, like, pull the sweatshirt up on my arm, and there's these three long scratch marks, like, all the way up my right forearm. And I was like, that is weird. So I pulled the sweatshirt off, thinking, oh, there must be something inside of it that had, like, scratched me. Like, is there a tag in there or something? There was nothing. There was literally no reason. And it looked like claw marks, like, and it was three of them. And I took pictures. I still have the pictures. And I was kind of thinking, this seems a little demonic. And then that night, my oldest daughter started screaming. I ran into her room, and she said, mom, my face is burning. And there were three big claw marks down her cheek onto her neck. And again, I'm trying not to scare my kids, but I'm, like, done at this point. We started looking through her bed. You know, is there something in your bed that could have scratched your face? Now, sometimes she was a little kid, she would, like, sneak Doritos into her bed or something. You know, is there crumbs Is there anything? There was literally nothing. And she was a kid who always, like, she really had short nails, so she didn't scratch herself, and she hadn't gone to sleep yet, so she didn't scratch herself in her sleep. Because I asked her that, like, were you scratching your face? Did anything like that happen? She said, no. I was just literally laying here, and my face started burning, and it looked exactly the same as my arm. It was three deep red scratches on her face and her neck. And I took pictures of that, too. So after I got her calmed down, I went out into the hallway and I kind of, like, talked out loud, being like, whatever you are, you don't mess with the wrong person. You can mess with my. My property. You can mess with me. Don't mess with my kids. You are not welcome here. You know, I just kind of went off. And then the next day, I actually called our pastor from our church because I was like, I know this sounds crazy, but here's what's going on. What do we do? I mean, I'm not Catholic, so I can call a priest or anything, but really soon, my preacher came over, and she was like, yeah, I believe you. Things like this are real. So she kind of, like, did a blessing on the house and holy water, and my youngest daughter was terrified to let her into her room. That's where things are happening, right? So she came in the Mustang house, and then we sold the house because I said, I'm not living here anymore with a potential demon or something that is, like, literally harming us now.\n\n[Speaker D] So we sold our house and moved.\n\n[Speaker F] On a month later, and we have not had any issues since, except for my youngest daughter, who is now a teenager, still teaching. She's kind of come to the realization that she's a bit of a medium or a bit of a conduit or something, because everything started when she started, like, walking and talking. So you realize that all of this centered around her, so she's actually seen another person to try and figure out how to keep bad spirits away, how to deal with it. But anyways, that's my story revolving around our old house. I just want to say thank you for the podcast. You just thoroughly enjoy it.

I'm calling from Northern California in the mountains. I am calling in response to to your episode about Shadow people. I didn't realize that other people had experienced what I had until listening to this podcast. So I wanted to talk about something that happened to me about a year ago when I had moved in with my now husband last fall. He immediately had to go work out of town about two hours away. And so we had started our relationship, we had started our newlywed ship, and I was staying in his house by myself. Let me just also preface by saying that I see and sense entities, spirits, just what have you. I have my whole life. And that's just to say why I show a lack of fear later on.\n\n[Speaker E] In this story that I'm telling you.\n\n[Speaker D] So a little less than a year ago, I was staying in this house by myself. It was snowing outside. I was pretty vigilant, you know, wanting to protect myself. Even though we live in a small mountain town, it's like less than 2,000 people. But I had this occasion where I woke up in the middle of the night, which honestly isn't rare for me at all. I woke up at around three in the morning and I sit up in bed because there's this figure sitting at the edge of my bed. And I could tell it's a female figure. She was wearing a cloak. And it was a white cloak, but it wasn't regular white. It wasn't even quite opalescent. It was like the way the moon shines. It reminds me of story recently that I listened to on this podcast about a person who had seen a cloaked figure on the subway whose cloak was the cosmos. This kind of reminded me of that. So anyways, I see this cloaked figure at the edge of my bed. And I sit up in the middle of the night and I feel a sense of calm, I feel a sense of peace. But I feel something else to my right side, which by the way, the bed is set so that the head of the bed is in line with the doorway to go into the bedroom. And I feel a presence to my right. And it's like a man above the doorway who's crouched down on all fours and his bottom is backed up to the ceiling. His hands are clutched above the door frame like the top of the door frame. And he's wearing a bowler's cap and.\n\n[Speaker F] What looks like a suit.\n\n[Speaker D] And he's kind of like banging his head repetitively. And I'm sitting up in bed and I'm just kind of watching him for.\n\n[Speaker F] Like a couple seconds.\n\n[Speaker D] And like I said, I'm kind of used to seeing this sort of thing. And I just kind of knew because he was a silhouette. So obviously if I turn on the lights, he's going to go away. And mind you, you know, I'm very open minded. I like to look at myself as someone who's a believer but who wants to be a skeptic, which is kind of the opposite of what I hear from people who call in. A lot of people are skeptics but want to be believers. I appreciate that. I'm a little bit of the opposite though. So, you know, I'm open to the fact that maybe I sat in bed a little bit in the middle of the night. Maybe I was still dreaming. Maybe I was still a bit in my dream state. Maybe I was hallucinating, you know, if anything, I'm more scared of real people than entities, you know. So I sit up in bed, I turn on the light, he goes away. But what strikes me as interesting is it took me a little bit to realize that a few years ago in my journal entries, I journal quite a bit that I have actually seen this figure before in a dream. I'm also someone who lucid dreams quite a bit. It's just something that I've always been able to do. And about six years ago I had this dream and it was a lucid dream and it was really pretty. I was in a house, but I knew that it was haunted. And I realized that I was dreaming. And as I'm ascending up the stairs of the house, gravity becomes less and less relevant. So I'm ascending up the stairs and I'm kind of flying. I realize that I could float at that point. And I go up to the rooftop of the house, and the rooftop of this house, there's like a sunset scape of pinks and oranges and all that sort of thing. But it also looks like a bunch of debris from something like a tornado. And I see this figure off in the distance. He looks like he's wearing some sort of a hat, maybe some sort of a suit. I don't even know. But I feel safe. So I'm on top of this roof fixture, and he's kind of catching different pieces of debris in the sky to make his way towards me. I could tell he wanted to talk to me, and I felt like he wanted to impart some sort of wisdom. And I'm looking back in my journal on January 13th of 2018, and it says that I had an intense dream before I woke up where I was in a severely haunted house. Everything was haunted. There was a man. He was otherworldly. He had shades over his eyes. He managed to hop, skip, and surf a shard of wood onto the rooftop with me with one other person. It was someone I know who was with me, but I can't remember who. The man peered through our eyes into our souls, and I can't fully describe because I felt at ease with him, but it felt like he was collecting souls, but like in a calm and peaceful way, almost like a grim reaper, where it was like he was just doing it when it was in their time, you know? And then he came up upon the rooftop with me, and he takes his shades off. And this is where it reminds me of the shadow people stories I've heard on your podcast, because other people have said that they're shadow people who have red eyes. I saw this person. He had a bowler's cap, he had a tie. He had, like, a blazer of some sort. And his eyes were like red swirls or vortexes, if you will. And it just felt like he had some sort of wisdom to impart to me. And he told me, and I'm reading from my journal. He says, ah, yes, you are aware of your mistake. You are happy now. Well done. Ah, yes, you were in denial, but you know this now, and you are moving on. And then he let out an accomplished sigh, and he removed his shades, revealing those crazy swirling spirals atop the whites of his eyes. And he was grinning. And let me tell you that this dream stuck out to me so much that I took it to therapy and I told my therapist to be about it. I drew pictures about it because I felt like the dream had something to tell me. Needless to say, I can't help but connect that weird sort of lucid dream that I had, however many years ago, to waking up in the middle of the night this last year, during last winter, where I felt like I encountered a spiritual presence. But what inspired me to call in was that other people have had this sort of experience, experience too. And I had no idea. I just thought, like, well, you know, maybe I'm hallucinating or dreaming or whatever. But yeah, I don't know. I'm a believer. But I'm open to being a skeptic, so I would love to hear what other people's experiences are. Thank you so much for what you do. Thank you for your team. Thank you for your community. I appreciate you.

So my story is, well, one among many. This one goes back to November of 2011, so some 13 years ago almost. I was 16 years old at the time. And also interestingly enough, this was a week before I was going to go on a school trip overseas to Cambodia and Vietnam, interestingly enough for two weeks. So literally a few days before I was going to fly out with my other students. It would have been about between say 9 o' clock and 9:30 at night on a weekend evening. So possibly I'd say a Saturday. Where I live in Sydney. To give you a bit of context, if you look at map of Sydney, it's quite a large, expansive city. So for a bit of context, I live in the southeast. What's important is that where I live it's quite close to the bush, your equivalent of the forest. And we live on a ridge that overlooks a small valley that overlooks another neighboring suburb. And in between that it's all just bushland, it's all forest, you know, it's all a valley and ridges as well. And our house is two stories with our kitchen and lounge room upstairs, not downstairs. So we have a massive panoramic view of an incredible amount of Sydney metropolitan and beyond that and of course bushland. And the other thing is too, where we live at nighttime it's very quiet and also we get to see a lot of stars. So essentially I was upstairs in the kitchen at the time, outside our kitchen window, lounge room and of course the dining area, we have a massive veranda, so like a balcony. And I was standing there just looking out the window as I do almost any night, looking into the distance, looking up at the night sky, looking at the lights in the distance, the neighbouring suburb, whatever, looking directly from the kitchen window. Straight ahead there is still currently a ridge, but also now it's residential area. This is where it gets interesting, because 13 years ago, from 2010 to 2011, the entirety of the area that is now residential, connecting to the rest of our area as well. So there used to be a main road that was at one point in time an Earthri road. And because of development, it's gone further. And that area 13 years ago was complete dense bushland. There was no roads, there was no streets, there were no street lights. And there was no houses, of course, either, not even foundations for ones to be built. It was all landlords being surveyed for building residential areas. Now, one thing I can say also because we have down in the valley tracks that are used by the rural fire brigade during the summertime of year. As you can imagine, we get bushfires in Australia, just like you get forest fires in the US or in Canada or even over in Europe. There are fire trails that fire trucks use to conduct their training and their preparation for bushfire season in the summer. So anyway, importantly to note where this ridge is back then and now, there were never any fire trails around them. And also, it's incredibly rocky, so no vehicles can drive through it so easily without falling off. So I'm standing there and I'm watching what to me was the most bizarre thing I've seen really since forever. Pulsating blue, red and white lights belonging to something that was clearly physical. It almost opened up is the best way I can describe. Appeared out of nowhere. And it lasted for a good maybe five minutes or so. And the best way I can describe it is it was swimming, it was meandering through the tree line in such a way that it didn't have any effect on the trees themselves. They didn't move, they didn't bend, no sound, but a very intense, bright light that would pulsate back and forth, back and forth. And at this point in time, I am utterly transfixed in what I'm seeing. So much so that I can't scream and say, hey, guys, or whoever, come up and see this. Can you see what I'm seeing? And even now, 13 years later, it is still a rather bizarre thing that I saw. I don't know if it was necessarily a ufo. It certainly wasn't a drone, because drones were a thing back then. It was not a helicopter, frankly, I would even call this thing a high aerial craft because it was so low. And it was basically, as I can, as I would say, it was meandering its way through the tree lines. So as soon as it was there, as it appeared, it quickly ended. It didn't disappear. Like going up into the sky, shooting up at incredible speeds. It almost like it just turned off and it was gone, never to be seen again. I don't know what you would call this. I mean, certainly by today's standards, it's a uap, Unknown Aerial Phenomena. Because this thing was not so much flying as it was more hovering. And like I said, I can distinguish between a fire truck with its lights on. And importantly, there were no tracks, no roads, no footpaths, or nothing at the time in that location. Now, if you were to see it with your own eyes, you would see houses and street lights, and it's a lot more open and less trees. At this point in time, it was densely filled with trees, eucalyptus trees, like we have in Australia anyway. And of course, no tracks. That's the important part. So this thing was not driving because you can clearly tell when it's on the road or on the ground and it's moving. This thing was in midair, so it was flying or hovering, but it was almost like snaking its way through. It lasted all between maybe five minutes. I've never experienced a phenomenon like that again. In 13 years, I've seen nothing of the sort. It certainly wasn't a plane, it wasn't a drone, it was on a helicopter. It absolutely was not a fire truck. It wasn't an object that was being driven as opposed to hovering and, you know, fluidly moving through the air. That's my story, and I hope it can be of use to other people who might have seen something similar to that. Any case, thank you very much. Thanks for your time.\n\n[Speaker A] Thank you, James. Now, here's my thought. It was low to the ground, it meandered back and forth, and it seemed to shut off suddenly. So I wonder if James wasn't watching some sort of kite that was all lit up. And when the kite's lights were cut, James lost the craft in the darkness. I've seen these things around. People put LEDs or pyrotechnics on kites and fly them back and forth, typically on a beach. Now, I link to a video example over in the description of this episode, but that's just my guess here, based on my interpretation of the description James gave. Of course, this could have been almost anything. But I appreciate the entry, James. It's always fun to get insight on another country's paranormal activity. Now, folks, we're down to one last call here this evening, and this one packs a double punch.

And they are based around my bed. So I moved into the place that I'm in now 12 years ago, and I had my great aunt Zona's bed frame. And I had had it before this house, but I always liked it when I go to my grandmother's house. I grew up sleeping in it. It was in her guest bedroom. And then when they downsized, I got that bed frame. And I never met my great Aunt Zona. She had passed before I was born. So anyways, I moved into this new place. I got my bed all situated, I got my bedroom all situated and began living from here. It was a hard time in my life. I was a newer single mom. Stressful time, stressful divorce. And I needed to go back to school to figure out my life. And my kid at that time was a toddler or, you know, whatever three or four is. At one point during my college career, I had to commute a pretty good distance. So get the kid, take myself to school, bring myself back, get the kid, make dinner, have some quality time with said kid, and, you know, do homework, make sure I have enough sleep, because I'm crazy if I don't have sleep. You know, that sort of thing just hard. And so when I would lay down to bed, I would almost, almost pass right out. But before I did, I noticed, I don't know, that there was one time that I noticed it was more like kind of fading into my memory, that there was a feeling that there was something standing beside my bed, kind of at my head, just beside my side, looking down at me. And while that sounds completely horrific, terrifyingly awful, it didn't feel that way. It felt almost concerned and supportive. And although it didn't ever move or express or gesture anything, it did feel like I said. It did feel like it was listening, concerned, interested. And so right before bed, I would talk to it out loud. I'd whisper, if I had my kid in the house with me. And I would just tell it what was happening for me that day. And, I don't know, everything, you know, good, bad, hard, beautiful, all the things. And at some point over the years, I mean, this went on not every single night. I may not engage with it every single night, but, you know, if I wanted to, bam, it was there. And sometimes it was there before I thought about it. I started expressing gratitude for it, even towards it, you know, I'd say, you know, thank you so much for being here. Interestingly enough, I can't explain this. I have no understanding or reference, nor have I heard about anything like this. But while it was standing beside me, it also seemed like it multiplied itself around all three sides of the bed. And each one of itself was a little more faded than the one before. So the one beside me was pretty strongly there. It was kind of like a shape or a hooded, cloaked. Not a lot of definition there. And then the one beside it was a little bit lighter, a little bit faded, and then so on all the way around until, like, you know, if there was somebody sleeping beside me, which it wasn't, but then it would hardly be over there. It didn't seem like more than one, energetically. I don't know how to explain that. It all seemed like the same being, just kind of spreading itself out thin around the bed. I don't know if that related to my Great Aunt Zona or if it had to do with the house. I'm thinking that it might have to do with the house. So over time, I graduated college, got a job, things got a little bit easier. At least I didn't have to do homework all the time. Just things were a little lifted, less stressful. And I've always kind of connected with my Great Aunt Zona and her sister, who was my Great Aunt Bess. And they both had passed before I was born. And I know that Great Aunt Bess wanted to meet me. She passed, actually, like, I was a month late. And Grant, Aunt Zona died during that time. So I just missed her, you know. So I have pictures of them in the house, and I talk to them a lot. I wouldn't say that I see them, but I just feel like they're here. I don't know. I say that because this just didn't feel like that. I guess the entity around my bed felt like it was interacting with me. Whereas when I call on my Great Aunt Bess and my Great Aunt Zona, it's more like a prayer. It's more like a feeling of prayer with them. So one day, it occurred to me that I had been kind of interacting with this entity around the house. I would start talking to it. I don't even know if it was the same entity or not, honestly. But it wasn't really around my bed so much anymore. I didn't need it to be around my bed. But one day I thought, you know, I wonder if they're stuck here in this house. Here I am spilling my guts, and they're nice enough to listen and be supportive and compassionate. But what if they're actually stuck here? You know, what about them? So I just felt really deeply about this. All of a sudden one day, and I sat on my bed, I pushed my door closed because my kid doesn't want to hear anything about this. It freaks him out. I started to kind of whisper, you know, in a way that my kid wouldn't hear. I'd say, if you're there, would you please come in to my bedroom? I just want to talk to you about something. And lo and behold, my bedroom door opens, and I was so expecting something to happen that it didn't freak me out. And I just said to it, you know, everything I just said, you know, I realized that I just feel you wandering around the house. And, you know, if you happen to be locked in here in some way, I want you to know that I free you. I want you to feel free to leave this house whenever you want to. And because you seem kind, compassionate, respectful, you can come back if you want to. But just know I right now break all binds, you know, all promises, all anything that has kept you here, if indeed you are kept here so that you may leave. And when you leave, I hope that you find the most beautiful next chapter that you can possibly experience. I never felt it again. And there was a part of me that really wanted to be like, oh, wait, I miss you. But I make sure not to try to talk to that. I never do, actually. And I'm actually standing right outside my front door right now because I don't want to pull back in something that I have given a choice to. If it wanted to leave, then it should go. And it did. And it was such a beautiful experience. I didn't know if it was something that you all would be interested in.

I don't know if it's connected, but about a year before I stopped over the road driving, I lost my brother to a bad staph infection. He was living down in Dallas at the time and back home in Oklahoma. Now. We grew up in the house that I'm currently living in, and he had moved down to Dallas. Mom moved down there with him to be with him. He had had some surgery done and he had died from a really bad staph infection that was caught too late. And then just later that summer, say about six months later, I lost my mom. And about that time is when I came home, you know, pretty much for good. I started to notice some things around the house. My wife had always told me she's sensitive, and she's noticed that we've had a little trickster spirit, I guess you could say that's been playing around in the house some. But the thing that's really been spooking me is that about three months after my mom passed, and my mom's always. She's always hated dogs, you know, and I'm totally the opposite. Love dogs. They're like our fur kids. And I don't know if this is her stirring stuff up. I really don't want to say it is, but I sometimes Wonder. But about 2:30, and it's not all the time. It's like maybe once or twice a week, about 2:30 in the morning to about 3, I wake up because the dogs are going nuts and they're always facing toward the living room. And I'll start walking around and making sure everything's okay. And every time I walk in to the living room, the TV is on and we've shut it off. It's smart TV that, you know, when it comes time to get ready to go to bed, we always set the timer so that way if we doze off, it'll shut off and, you know, notice that we'll drag our rear ends to bed. But it always seems like if there's a little too much stress going on. I don't know if that could be it or doing it. But, you know, the TV will come on, even the computer monitor will come on. And we've got that in the living room as well. And they're on two separate electrical circuit. So I know it's not a power surge doing it. And my oldest son, he lives with us still. We both work at the same place and he's noticed it as well. It's always when the dogs just go completely nuts, like somebody's wandering around. So don't know if it's mom still aggravating the dogs because she don't like them. It's always weird. It's just one of those weird things. And we've had two different TVs in the living room since I've been home. And there's always something turning it on. So I don't know, sometimes it'll be on full volume. Other times it's just on and quiet, like it's muted. So I don't know if that's mom still doing that or if it's that little trickster. But we've got a little friend there. And sometimes we do catch the little ghost. It's a little girl. Sometimes I still see that little girl out of the corner of my eye in her little outfit. She's got like a little blue jumper on, a white blouse, kind of sandy blondish hair. And we've been in that house since 1984. So I don't know anything of the history prior if anybody has lost a child there. But I do notice that since mom passed, she stays in the hallway. She won't come out of the hallway because she used to run. You know, we catch her different various places of the house. But since mom passed, she's not coming out. So I don't know. That's just one of those creepy things. I'd been talking to a friend about it and he popped the question. Especially as you're dealing with my wife being sensitive. And if she's caught any of this, and I have asked her, and she has, but she's of that train of thought that you don't cleanse your own home. You have another sensitive come in to do it. It's some kind of belief that she has from growing up, because that's. Apparently there's a line of this in her family. But she said she would do it if they ended up harming any of our animals or any of us. But there's nothing. It's just like playing tricks on us and such. So that's just kind of what's been going on, and I kind of wonder if anybody else has got something like this going. So really love the show. Appreciate everything you do for us out here. It really makes the day or evening, whenever I'm working, to go by quicker. Keep up the great work.

I'm actually from Houston, and the reason I'm bringing it up is because I heard Jude's story on the June 16 episode, which is Volume 3 Shadow People Files. It's not exactly related to Shadow People, but the fact that he talks about his family uncovering bones on the property reminds me Neo story that my mother told me a couple of years ago in Mexico. My father owns a home that my grandmother his mother lived in and the home is actually neighboring two of his brother's homes, so he has two brothers that have property in Mexico as well. Her house was next to one of my uncle's homes. And the reason I bring this up is because a couple of my cousins grew up in that house that neighbored My grandmother's house. And they always talked about having weird experiences in the house that my grandmother lived in. My grandmother would even talk about seeing or sensing some kind of weird shadow. I guess it is a shadow person. She's unfortunately passed away. So I can't really get a lot of information. But I do remember her bringing that up a couple of times. And then my cousins would tell me that they never liked going to my grandmother's house at night. Because the lighting wasn't very good. And it was just my grandmother, she only slept in the bedroom. They never really used any of the other rooms. Because she would just go to my uncle's home to eat and hang out with the family. But they would talk about how they always got a weird sensation. And a couple the time they thought they would see some kind of dark, shadowy thing in the corner of her bedroom. And my grandmother just kind of got used to it, actually. She really didn't think it was that weird. She just thought it was odd that my cousins refused to go to her home at night. And then about 10 years ago, they were expanding that home. And they had to escalate, excavate around it. And in, I think, either the new additional bedroom they were adding. Or this bathroom of that bedroom. Those contractors found bones because they were excavating for the new foundation, and they found bones there. They basically mentioned it, I think, to my uncle at some point, but no one really brought up. So they just. When they dug them up, they just bury them back again. And my mother found out a couple of years ago that that's what happened. And at this point, they don't really want to dig up the bones anymore. So they're just staying under the foundation of the house. So I'm wondering if it was related to that uneasy feeling. My cousins would get along with seeing things in that home. And then a couple of years ago, since my parents don't really use that property for anything, they had my uncle take care of it. And one of the things they do is they rent it out. Well, when they rented that house out, One of the tenants they had at one point was a single mom. And no one really knew a lot about her. They just knew she was not from my parents hometown, she was from another town. And she had moved there because apparently she was escaping an abusive relationship. And somebody murdered her in that house near the same vicinity of the area of where the bones were found. The weird part is people claim they didn't hear anything because she was killed in the middle of the day. So I always wondered if it was maybe just bad luck for a person who was killed or that property just had some negative energy attached to it because of the bones that were found. But I just thought it was strange that all those things happened in one property. I do know that my parents will eventually have the house excavated again within the next year because they're going to actually find those bones and give that person a proper burial, whoever that is. It's really sad to think about all the negative things that happened in that home, but I just wanted to share the story. Thanks for what you do.

Just wanted to tell you a story about what happened to me last summer. We were on vacation in Cancun. Flew from Cancun to our friends of ours hometown. It's called Nonuva, Chihuahua, Mexico. So it's an old little town, been around for a long time. So what happened to me was we pulled up to our friends aunt's house, which is old house, you know, and we unloaded everything they sent us to go get drinks. It was broad daylight. We went to the store, got drinks, whatever. We came back, we pulled over, whatever. We were getting stuff out. I was in the passenger seat. I got out and I was starting to get the drinks out, and I heard somebody call my name. They were like, hey, wait. And I thought it was my friend that was driving. I thought he was the one calling me. Well, I thought it was weird, right? So I grabbed the drink and then he walks around, gets out of the driver's seat, and I'm like, hey, dude, like, did you call my name? And he just looks at me like, no, I'm. Are you sure? You go, yeah. Why? I was like, because I just heard somebody call my name. Okay, whatever. We walked inside. So, you know, I just kind of just sitting there thinking about it. I told his mother in law the hell. Just the weirdest thing that's happened to me. She's like, what happened? I just heard somebody call my name, like outside. And she's like, go, show me where. So I went and showed her where it happened and she just like got kind of like, hey. She's like, they said that there's a lady that is seen walking through here at night, like a ghost lady, you know? And I'm like, for real? She's like, yeah, that's crazy. So I had a ghost call my name. And that was kind of freaky. One side of that house is, you know, I guess haunted because they hear things.

This happened around 1996. I was a kid at the time. Me, my family, and some family friends we had took a trip down to Monterrey, Mexico. There's street vendors, downtown marketplaces, and a lot of people that make, you know, things that are handmade where we were at. Again, I was a kid and I saw, like, a little handmade puppet very similar to Pinocchio. You can move it with, you know, strings and things like that. And I really wanted it. We got it. Well, later that night, when my family and I went back to our hotel, it was not late in the evening. And out of the blue, the lights went out in our hotel room. And when the lights went out, there was something that looked like a literal lightning bolt flash. It just kind of appeared nearly in the middle of the room. I mean, as quick as lightning. It looked like lightning. It did not look like when a light bulb blows, you know, I'm 35 now. I can look back at that memory and look at, you know, when a light bulb blows today, and I'm like, yeah, that's not what I saw when I was little. And what's crazy is, you know, when my dad, he got up out of his bed and he went to turn the bathroom light on, my doll that my family had purchased for me, the Pinocchio, like, doll, it had moved to the center of the room. That was one of the freakiest things that has ever happened in my life. You know, I know there have been tales of haunted dolls all throughout, you know, the world. You got Robert the doll, you got Annabelle the dollar. But whatever this was, you know, the power going out, the lightning bolt flash, and that doll apparently moving from my little nightstand dresser to the center of the room on its own.

So I had to have been like about nine or ten by this time. My parents were already divorced. My mom moved us out to a country house right on the outskirts of town. It wasn't so far away from town. I used to walk into town. The town was kind of expanding at that time, so they had some new houses built up back to the left hand side of our house. And if you go right, should take you out into the country. So one day my mom said she's going out with some friends, left me in charge of the kids. One of her friends came over, left her kids there with us. Mind you, I'm have to be better 9 or 10. Back then it wasn't too uncommon for the parents to leave their kids by themselves. You know, it wasn't the first time, but it was the first time in his new house. They take off, I have to say, about 7:30pm and it's me, my three brothers and two of our friends. So we're just, you know, sitting there watching Team Woo. My brother's playing the PS2 in the room and eventually about 9:30, everybody's pretty much asleep. Me and one of the other boys, that my mom's friend Hittinghama was awake and we were watching tv. That I recall was music videos, actually, back on mtv. And I just get this uneasy feeling in my stomach. You think you have to go to the bathroom, but you don't. And something kept drawing me to my window. Mind you, in this house, we had a big, maybe four foot by eight foot window. Nothing in the middle, just one big panel of glass. I looked out the window and from my house to the street, it's about a football field length trees in between the middle of fields, plum trees, actually. I remember seeing this white glowing fog. Not sure what it was at first. Kind of stuck on it, you know. And it's walking along with the row, mind you, behind my house, about another football field. Back behind us is a river. And I see this fog walking towards the river, kind of, you know what I mean? Catches my attention. I'm stuck on it. I wake up the boy that was next to me because he had fallen asleep. And he's looking, he says he doesn't see nothing. I look back, the white figure was gone, whatever it was. And I closed the window and I'm just like, what the heck was that? So he goes to the bathroom. As he goes to the bathroom, I look back out the window. There's this lady standing in front of the house, I must say, about 100ft from my house, just looking at the house. And I keep hearing this cry, like a whimper, like she's whining about something. And I close the window again and I'm just like, look back out. And this time she's walking back away, back towards the river. And I can still hear the crying. My friend comes back out and I'm like, look at this. And he looks, he goes, there's nothing there. I look back out behind him. There's nothing there. My mom came and I told her what it was, you know what I mean, what I saw and everything. And she kind of brushed it off. But I talked to my tia, my aunt. And she explained to me that what I saw was a lady called the Llorona, or the Crier, something like that. And the story is, I guess she was gonna get married to this guy. But in order for her to get married to this guy, she had to get rid of the children she had. I think it was two, if I'm not mistaken. And she took him to the edge of a cliff, sat him down, gave him ice cream, and I guess pushed him. She went back to go tell the guy what she had done, but she ended up coming back and the guy was with another girl. She ran to that same cliff and I guess jumped off and killed herself. And I guess it says that she's on the Rome looking for her kids. I don't know if it was her. Can't really explain what it was, But I do know I saw a lady, all white. The only thing that was really dark on her were like the outlines of her face. I. You could definitely see her face, but she had kind of like a veil on, but not covering her face, just like kind of draping down to the side. She's about the same size as my mom. I'm going to say five, eight, around that height. She was an adult woman. And that's what I saw. And that one right there really left like a eerie feeling in my body. Never went outside my house again in the night. Mind you, in the country, I mean, you hear a lot of stuff, coyotes and stuff, and as a kid, you get scared. But this right here was just something different. I had never seen something so defying, something so. So real, like, but yet white and misty. But that's what I saw.

I'm from Chicago, Illinois, and I want to tell you the time where I think I saw the Llorona. I was in Mexico. This happened around 22,002, 2001, I believe, for me and my parents and my sister, who went to a vacation in Mexico to visit one of my uncles. And this one night I had, like, this very intense dream where I was walking on a beach by myself, and this lady came up to me and she aggressively just grabbed me. And she grabbed me and she asked me, do you know where my daughter is? In Spanish? And I said, no. And when I said no, she let out like this very, like, intense scream. Like it was this in my face. And it was so lifelike that I woke up from my dream. And when I woke up from my dream, it was clearly a lady standing right on the edge of the bed. So I woke up this lady standing there, she's see through, she's wearing a white nightgown. And I could see her hair. It was, like covering her shoulders. Her head was tilted sideways. She had her mouth open, but I couldn't make out the features in her face. And I could clearly see her standing there. So I thought it was my mom. So I started going, mom, Mom. And my sister, who's sleeping next to me, she woke up and she's like, who are you talking to? And I was like, there's somebody standing right there. And I don't know what. My sister saw it too, but she was like, turn the light on. Turn the light on. And the light switch was, like, arm's distance away from Me. So I got the courage and I got up and I turned the light on. And as soon as I turned the light on, the person that was standing there was gone. But I clearly remember her. I clearly saw somebody standing there. Like she was wearing a white nightgown. I could see right through her. I could see her hair, I could see her head. I could see her mouth wide open.

I was actually just listening to the show season 8, episode 11 and you mentioned the forest fires and if someone could summon some rain and it reminded me of something that happened to me and my sister some years ago. Probably been at least 10 years if not more. We were in Mexico visiting family in the state of Durango. And at the time, they had been.\n\n[Speaker C] Going through a drought.\n\n[Speaker D] I think had been like a year.\n\n[Speaker C] Maybe over a year.\n\n[Speaker D] And growing up, we would always drive down there and stay a while. And it seems like every time we.\n\n[Speaker C] Went, we would bring the rain with us.\n\n[Speaker D] It would be a drought. You know, we'd get there, and within a couple days of us arriving, it would rain for a week or something. And, like, we always just brought the rain.\n\n[Speaker C] On this occasion, you know, there was.\n\n[Speaker D] A drought, and me and my sister.\n\n[Speaker C] Were like, well, there's no rain to bring. Because here, back home at the time.\n\n[Speaker D] Actually, it had been fairly dry. So we were, I guess, just being silly and remembered a. I guess a chance that was in a movie, the Secret garden, in the 90s. In the movie, this little boy is trying to summon his father. He's away, and he wants his father to return home.\n\n[Speaker C] So these kids go out on this.\n\n[Speaker D] Beach or whatever and say some little chant, and his dad ends up coming home anyways. This little chant, for whatever reason, kind of always stuck with us. We watched that movie a lot, but we remembered, and we were like, oh, let's try it. We just changed, you know, a couple of words. Instead of, you know, it being the dad, you know, we make it the rain.\n\n[Speaker C] And we did this.\n\n[Speaker D] We're walking down some little street, I.\n\n[Speaker C] Think we were walking to, like, one.\n\n[Speaker D] Of my aunt's houses or something. And we're just doing this chance, and that was that. Later that day, or maybe even the next day, my sister and I decided.\n\n[Speaker C] To go take a nap.\n\n[Speaker D] So we went to lay down, and we were sharing a bedroom, and there was two beds next to each other with a little nightstand in between.\n\n[Speaker C] And we take our nap.\n\n[Speaker D] And I've always had these weird experiences growing up. But I was sleeping, and my sister woke me up because I was crying in my sleep. And I had been dreaming, I guess, that there was some old woman that.\n\n[Speaker C] I somehow knew really wasn't an old woman, but it looked like an old.\n\n[Speaker D] Woman was trying to hurt my sister. We were somewhere, and I just see this old witch lady, whatever, trying to attack my sister.\n\n[Speaker C] And I'm trying to help her, and I can't.\n\n[Speaker D] And that's what makes me start crying in the dream. And my sister hears me, and she.\n\n[Speaker C] Wakes me up, and I'm like, I'm.\n\n[Speaker D] So glad that was just a dream.\n\n[Speaker C] I'm so glad you're okay.\n\n[Speaker D] And, you know, since I was crying.\n\n[Speaker C] She knows that I'VE always had these weird dreams. Growing up, she asked me what it was and I told her that, you know, some old woman was trying to hurt her and she just got really wide eyed and said that she had just been having a nightmare about some old witch who was standing over the bed trying to hurt her.\n\n[Speaker D] I've never experienced anything like that, where.\n\n[Speaker C] Someone sees what I saw, what I.\n\n[Speaker D] Dreamt, whatever you want to call it.\n\n[Speaker C] I've often wondered if maybe they're out of body experiences. And I don't know it. I don't know how to control it. I don't know how to. It just happened.\n\n[Speaker D] So it really weirded me out, you.\n\n[Speaker C] Know, both of us. It weirded us both out that we both saw the same thing. It was really trippy. Within a couple of days of this experience that we had, it started raining and it actually rained the rest of the time that we were there. I mean, it was just a movie. Sure.\n\n[Speaker D] It wasn't a real chant, but I guess when you believe in something or.\n\n[Speaker C] If you give it enough belief, maybe that gives it power. I don't know.\n\n[Speaker D] I was raised Catholic.\n\n[Speaker C] I don't practice it.\n\n[Speaker D] I consider myself to be more spiritual.\n\n[Speaker C] Than religious, whatever that means.\n\n[Speaker D] But I do believe in like the power of prayer. Because essentially prayers are like, chan.\n\n[Speaker C] Maybe we did that. I don't know. Maybe we tapped into something that we weren't supposed to that this witch showed up. I don't know. It was trippy.\n\n[Speaker D] It was a weird experience.\n\n[Speaker C] Did we summon the rain? Did we really summon rain? Like that's just. I don't know.\n\n[Speaker D] It was weird.

The town was the big city, but if you traveled like maybe 15, 20 minutes outside of that bigger city, there's a small village named La Jarita close to when I started going over there in the summer, I would hear these stories about this shadow man that would show up at night because his village is out there surrounded by cornfield, so they didn't even have indoor bathrooms back then. And it was the one time that when my mom's neighbor had to go to the restroom at an alcohol behind her house, she screamed really loud. Everybody came running and she said she saw a shadow person staring at her while she was using the outhouse out there, all the neighbors gathered up, went to the cornfield, searched around, they couldn't find anybody. Then my cousins, once again time, were asleep in their room. It felt like somebody was staring at them through the windows because they didn't have any AC units either. So they would sleep with the windows open. And my boss cousin screamed really loud. My uncle woke up, my aunt woke up, and they said that there was a shadow person staring through the window. So my uncle ended up putting bars on the windows. And they actually bought an AC unit because they didn't want to sleep with the windows open anymore. And so this shadow person would appear on one side of the town, the other side of town, because all the whole town was surrounded by cornfield. And in the town, there was a old lady that was the witch of the village. And she would pay us to bring her owl legs for her witchcraft. And so whenever we would find an owl, we would kill it by throwing either rocks or the slingshot. And they would die, and they were huge. And we would cut the legs off and we would send them to her, and she would use it for her witchcraft. And so one day, a bunch of friends of mine from the ages between 8, all the way up to 16, 17, we were playing a game of touch. In Spanish, it's called conjelao. And across the street from where we were playing touch at, there was an abandoned ranch. We stare across the cornfield to that abandoned barn over there, and there's like at least three or four huge white owls flying around in circles. And we all point at him. Oh, look, there's some owls flying around over there. Let's go kill them and take the legs off to sell them to the witch of the village. So we stopped playing touch. We started walking through the cornfield that night. It's pretty dark, but the moon is a full moon that day, so it's pretty bright. As we're walking towards the barn, we get pretty close to it. We're talking over there. We're walking, like in a group, but we're kind of like marching, like side by side. At least seven of us. As we get close to the barn, we start feeling a bunch of rocks falling from the sky. But they're not stone rocks, they're rocks of dirt, like mud rocks. So they started hitting us on the back and on the head. And they're breaking apart as they're falling down, a lot of them like it was raining rocks. And so we start like, what the heck? Who's throwing rocks at us, thinking there's somebody throwing rocks from the abandoned barn towards where we're at. So we start grabbing rocks, start throwing them back at this barn where these owls are flying over. And so we throwing rocks. We're throwing rocks. We're throwing rocks. We're throwing me. I'm at the very right side of this group. Like, we're in a line side by side. I'm on the very far right. The corn is pretty tall, at least over our head for sure. And in the corner of my eye to the right side, I see, like, a black figure. Looks like the shape of a person, but squatting down on the corner very clearly. I see it. I can only see their eyes kind of bright white. And I'm looking at it, and I'm throwing rocks towards the barn. But I'm also kind of, like, looking at this thing on the corner of my eye. And I stop throwing rocks, and I look at it, and I start staring at it. And I'm like, who's that? I told my friends in Spanish, you know, I say, hey, guys, stop throwing rocks. Who's this person squatting down right next to us? And everybody stops throwing rocks. And when we stop throwing rocks and focus on this person or what we think is the person, the rocks stop falling. Like, nobody's throwing rocks at us anymore. We're looking at it, but we can't see, like, any shape. It looks like a human, but there's no nose. No, it's like a shadow. But we can definitely see the eyes. And me and my friends are like, hey, who are you? And we're talking at it, all of us. There's like, seven of us. One of my friends that's like, the tough guy of the group had a baseball bat, and he comes pretty close to her, and he says, if you don't tell me who you are, I'm gonna hit you with my bat. And when he says that, that person thing pops up in the air. Like, jumps up and stands up and is pretty tall. My friend throws the bat at it and runs in the opposite direction. And we all just run. But I was so scared that I couldn't run fast. I remember trying to run, but I couldn't. I'm running really slow. And we start running towards the village. And I look back to see it, and it's running behind me, but in such a weird way. It's such a creepy way. It's kind of like skipping with its arms, running up and down. Very weird. I got even more scared watching it Run behind me. That creepy that I almost froze. But my friend grabbed me and pulled me. I was like, come on, let's go, let's go. Get to the edge of the cornfield. And the first house out of the cornfield into the village is my uncle's house. And by the time I get there, they already had knocked on my uncle's door. And they said, hey, that shadow thing is in the cornfield chasing us. My uncle. Whistle screams. The whole village, nobody even asked any questions. Everybody brought the shotguns out, their guns, everything. The whole village gathered up with a flashlight. And they're like, let's go for it. And us, the kids, we stayed there. The adults went in the cornfield to the back of the village. There was also at the small forest. They went to the forest with cars, trucks, guns, searched for the thing all night, couldn't find it. But they didn't even ask us any questions because they already knew what it was. And so me and my friends were like, oh, my God, that was crazy. What was that? And so nothing happened for a while. And then one day, we end up going to a quinceanera, which is like a sweet 16, but for 15 years old in Mexico. And so I go with my uncle, my aunt and my cousin. It ends up finishing, like around 12 o' clock at midnight. They come back at midnight, back to the village, to my uncle's home where I'm staying at for the summer. And my uncle and my aunt have this weird thing. I don't know, they're the only ones that do this. But when my uncle go uses the restroom at the outhouse, which is behind the house, my aunt would always accompany him, take toilet paper and the flashlight that she would wait outside while he used the restroom. And so we get back from the quinceanera, they put the kids to bed and everything in the room. On the other room, the AT had broke down, so the kids were gonna all sleep in one room with my uncle. And I'm in there while they're laying down, going to sleep, and my aunt, my uncle go to the restroom. And all of a sudden my aunt comes running in by herself, really scared, goes inside the room where I'm at and the kids are asleep. And she just doesn't even say anything. She'll go straight to the closet. And I'm like, what is she doing? She's going through the closet looking for something. All of a sudden she turns around with a handgun and some bullets. Handgun on one side, bullets on the other side of it. And she looks at me and she says, here, go help your uncle. He's chasing that thing again. And I was so scared that I said one of the most weakest things I could say. I said, no, I'll stay here with the kids. You go with my uncle. And she said, heck no. I'm not saying you're the kid, you're the man. You go help your uncle find that thing. So I'm like, damn. So I get the gun and I get the bullets. I have the bullets on my right hand and the gun on my left, and I start walking to the back. She locks the door, make sure nobody comes in. And I'm out there looking for my uncle in the cornfield, trying to help him find this creature. And I keep whispering in Spanish and I say, uncle, where are you? It's me, uncle, where are you? I didn't even put the bullets in the gun. The gun had no bullets because that's how scared I was. I kept the bullets in my right hand and I keep on whispering, uncle, where are you? Where are you? And I, I hear him say, hey, don't shoot me. I'm walking up towards you. And he does. I see him and I'm like, oh, I feel so relieved. I said, here, I give him the bullets, I give him the gun. He said, you need to put the bullets inside the gun. I'm like, I'm shaking. I'm so scared. I don't know what to do. And so he ends up waking up the neighbors again. They all grabbed their rifles and their flashlights and we again started looking for it through the woods, through the cornfield. We could not find it. We never found out what that thing was. We never found it. And that's the last time I remember hearing about that shadow person, that creature in the cornfield. But it didn't happen once. It happened multiple times, and it happened to different people. And that is my story.

I'm on the Baja Peninsula in lovely Mexico. I'm from San Francisco Francisco area. Lived here three years. Best decision I've ever made. Anyways, I remember you talking about the Ano Triangle. So back in 2008, I went camping in that beautiful part of the world with my sister and her husband. It was between Christmas and New Year's. We were on the way to San Felipe in Mexico. You know, we had a campfire and just hanging out, nothing fancy. I saw what I thought was a plane, like one that's coming towards you. Very, very bright light. I know this has been reported by other people many times. It, like, turned into, like, 20 little lights and they started zipping and zapping every which way. And then they'd go back to the center and make that one big light. And then they made a formation of, like, a line. And then they'd separate and go all different ways. But it was like, zip, zip, zip, zip, like, super fast. This was like before drones. And it was far enough away, it was looking west. It was my first time in that park. So I thought it was maybe the Air Force Base San Diego or something like that, but I've never heard of Technology like that. But I looked on the interwebs and actually saw some videos of the same phenomena. I don't remember where. I think it was other locations. But then I heard your podcast about the Anza Borrego Triangle or something.\n\n[Speaker C] Yeah, I don't know.\n\n[Speaker D] It was just very peculiar. Okay, be well.

I'm from the Finger Lakes region of western New York, where spiritualism, the Fox sisters, and all sorts of fun religions and cults have started enough. So we call it the Burned Over District. So I'm used to being in an area that has otherworldly and paranormal sort of vibes. I am actually calling because I listened to episode 43 in season 18. One of the guys was talking about seeing something kind of moving on rails down a hallway in a kind of repetitive fashion. And I have a story that I've been meaning to call and after listening to this, it really kind of made me realize I should. So this starts with me being a little kid, one of my best friends. We were three days apart and we lived only a couple Miles apart from each other out in the country. So we have pictures of us being newborns together. That's how long we were friends. And I would go over to his house and hang out. And just as kids do, long story relatively short. Unfortunately, he lost his father. He was an electrician and died at work. His mom remarried and they moved away. And in that time, my cousin and her husband bought their house and lived there. They still have that house. Now, I had been in that house from time I was a child. So it was kind of interesting to be in that house as an adult. Then they were traveling for a week. They were taking a family trip or something else. And they needed someone to house sit as well as watch their dog. Now, during this whole time, they actually would chuckle that the house was haunted and things would, like, move and fall. And I actually witness a couple times things weirdly moving that didn't just fall off a table, they kind of flung off a table. So there's always was kind of a joke about the house being haunted. And one of the things that they would say was that if you're sitting on the couch, there's a mirror on the one wall of the living room watching television. And in the mirror you can see down the hallway towards kind of the back door. And routinely they would see someone would walk in the back door any time of night, and they would go and check, and, you know, even a dog would run over there, check. There would be no one there. So I was told this by my cousin multiple times to keep an eye out for something that way. So as I'm sitting there kind of late at night, probably after midnight, dogs at my feet were watching television. And sure enough, down in that mirror, I catch something. Walk in the back door. The back door is locked. This isn't a country home. There is no one around. There's miles of empty farmland around this house. But clearly someone walked in the door. And I actually sent the dog over to check out, and dog walked over and no one was there. So I sat back down and probably 30 minutes maybe or so goes by, and I think I see something again move in the door. It goes in the door, quickly turns right. I feel like something's walking in. So I sat and watched and waited and nothing again. I kind of said hello, I think. And as I'm sitting there, I kind of just go back to watching the television straight ahead. And the back door immediately to the right, which the thing had walked into, was a bathroom. And that bathroom has a second door, which is in the Hallway, which is now my peripheral vision, my right eye. Imagine going 90 degrees. The hallway goes out. So the back of the couch is right against that wall. That would be the hallway down that way. So in my peripheral vision, as I'm watching television, I see what looks like something go out of the bathroom, down the hallway, into the master bedroom on that same side, as fast as I can turn my head. Something moved through there. But the crazy thing was, I wasn't scared by it. I wasn't like. But the feeling that hit me instantly, what hit me was a feeling of familiarity to it. And that's what caught me off guard more than anything else, that something moving down that hallway, this quick motion, this whole thing I'm seeing felt way more familiar than any sort of ominous, scary possible, you know, shadowy figure running down a hallway. And it wasn't like it was a human form. It was just something moving. I felt like the person that walked in the door kind of was the same sort of vibe of a person walking in with a person, of moving down that hallway. And I sat there for a second, and I couldn't quite understand why I was having a feeling of familiarity until it fully hit me, like a bolt out of the blue, that I'd seen this before. I'd seen this a lot before, is that when my friend's father would come home from work, he was an electrician. He was always covered with dust and dirt. His wife would make him go in the back door and then go right into the bathroom, get unchanged, take a shower, get himself all cleaned up. And then I would see him being a little kid, just. He would run down the hallway as quick as he could to go get changed, to come back and hang out with us and play with us. And I realized this thing I had seen move repetitively in the same sort of, like, action, like moving down a rail system, just a repetitive action, was something that was familiar to me. And it was exactly the actions I would see from my friend's father when I was a kid. And it makes me feel good. He just couldn't get home and wants to come out and hang out with us again, I feel like. But thanks so much for all you do. I really dig this show.

When I was a little boy, we used to go up to Oklahoma, visit my half brother and my half sister and all that. And one night we're over there going to like a fairground. It's like in winter of, I would say 80 or 81, five or six years old, very young. But this is such a vivid memory. And we're walking across the field. Yes. At night to a severe ground. You can see all their Ferris wheels, all that stuff. And as I'm walking with my family across the field, after we get out of the truck, I looked to the left and into the sky because something got my notice. There was a giant, for lack of a better word, it was a giant egg. It was like an egg shaped craft just hovering there. It was very luminous. It didn't have lights around it, but it looked like more like the lights were coming from within it. But there's no windows, no windows at all. Just an egg. A damn egg. It wasn't the moon and it was no blimp, no, nothing like that. I remember looking at the thing and what's weird is that I remember looking at it, but I don't remember looking away from it to continue walking with my family. Because one second I'm looking at it, next second I'm still welcoming my family to the fairgrounds and there's like a little blank space of time right in between me looking at it and that the memory didn't come back to me until like a few days later. And all of the memory just flashed back to me like. And even at that young age I remember, oh my God, what did I see, you know, that night? And the memory still stuck with me. But I, for life of me, for life of me, can I remember what happened in that gap when I looked at it? And then I continued to walk with my family, you know, to the fairground. I had no memory of the missing space. And I asked my mom, my dad and all that if they had seen it, you know, over the years. I asked them periodically and no, my ancestry didn't see it either. And so it was just one of those weird occurrences that as I got older I started studying more about UFOs. I found out that it's called a missing time effect. And what I had, I don't know. Even the egg shaped craft back then I thought I was the only one that seen something like that, but it's actually quite common, especially nowadays. I hear a lot of sightings of HC craft. There's even a CNA who works at Exploration My Mat, when she was 16, she saw an AC craft out in the country here in Texas. And it looked the same thing. That might look like it was a luminous egg shaped craft, but she didn't have the mission time effect that I did. But yeah, you do a great job. Great, great, awesome job. I love the podcast.

My daughter is a big fan of your show and she turned me onto it and wants me to tell my story. This happened July 29, 1981, during the wedding of Prince Charles and Princess Diana. My mother and I were in the front room watching tv. My back was facing the kitchen the where my mom was sitting. If she looked to her left, she could see the kitchen. All of a sudden it sounded like someone was in the kitchen, opening and slamming the cupboard doors and the drawers and throwing silverware all over the place.\n\n[Speaker C] And very loud, very scary.\n\n[Speaker E] I looked at my mom and she turned her head and looked into the kitchen for about two or three seconds. Then she looked back at me and her eyes were like really big. And she shook her head no, as if to say, don't turn around. Just sit there and wait. So about 20, 25 seconds later, it stopped. We then both got up, went into the kitchen. There was silverware everywhere on the floor, on the counters. The cupboard doors were still open, the drawers were still open. And we were just looking at each other like, what the heck happened? So we just cleaned up the kitchen and went back down and sat down and watched TV as if nothing happened. We never talked about it after that. I'm from California, born and raised, 43 years. I know what an earthquake feels like. It definitely was not an earthquake. I have researched earthquakes on July 29, 1981, in or around the Bay Area and could not find anything. So to this day we don't know what it was, but it was very, very scary. And she never did tell me what she saw that day that she looked into the kitchen. So I don't know what she saw. And well, thank you for letting me share my story.

I'm from Virginia, and I wanted to call in and share my story regarding mimics. I never really knew what mimics were, but when I grew up and started listening to stories and things like that, I realized that I may have had my own encounter with a mimic as a child. And this mimic would be something mimicking my mother. And the first experience I had with this was I was about four or five years old and I had woken up and I looked in my doorway and I saw my mom standing there, what looks like my mom, but she had a very bizarre, like, evil looking smile on her face. And she was holding a butcher knife. And I was really confused as a kid because I didn't really understand because I'm like, this is my mom. So I kind of just like looked away. And then when I looked back, it wasn't there. And then I just went back to sleep. And I asked her about it the next morning and she had no clue what I was talking about. And she just told me it was a nightmare. And, you know, I chalked it up to it being a nightmare. So When I was 16, I was dating this guy at the time and he lived with us. And he went into the kitchen to get something to eat. And he came all of a sudden, like, rushing down the hallway, like, back into my room. And like, he looked truly petrified. And when I asked him what was wrong, he's like, I don't want to talk about it. And like, that guy definitely did not get easily scared. And finally when he told me, he said that he was making a bowl of cereal. And when he turned and looked, there was my mom standing there, but she was like hunched over and she just looked like really like evil. And then he like turned away and turned back and it was gone. And then we asked my mom about it. She had again, no clue what we were talking about. And then the last encounter that I experienced was when I got home one night. I walked through the door. We had like this little foyer area. And then there was a set of stairs that went up and then down. And when you looked up, you saw our kitchen. And I remember clear as day seeing my mom standing in the kitchen, putting silverware away. So I turn, take off my shoes, start walking upstairs, and all of a sudden I see her sitting all the way in the back dining room. And they're like a pretty good room apart. Like, there's literally no way that she could have made her way from the kitchen all the way to the back dining room. By the time I walked up a few steps, I asked her, I was so confused. I was like, how did you get in there so fast? And she's like, what are you talking about? And I was like, you were just standing here putting silverware away. And she's like, no, I've been sitting here the whole time. And that was the last kind of encounter that I had with it. But anytime I think about this, I get instant chills and it really freaks me out just to have like multiple experiences and it all being like my mom in the same kind of like creepy version of her has definitely always kind of freaked me out. But that was in our old house and I've never experienced anything since moving out of that house. So I don't know, just weird coincidences or not. But it's definitely something that has freaked me out and I. I don't know if it could be a possible mimic, but hopefully I never have to encounter seeing my mother's so called mimic again because it was scary. But thanks for everything you do.

Today that's a four lane highway, but who knows what it may have been in years past in pioneer days. Because you know, I live near actually the Cumberland Gap, supposedly where Daniel Boone led the people westward. Anyway, I'm on my way to work really early. I'm a nurse at that time heading to work in my 7am shift. It was dark at that time. I had probably about an hour, a little over an hour drive. So I'm driving along doing around 55 mile an hour, careful not to speed or get a ticket or anything. I'm traveling northbound US 25E and on the other side there is a southbound 25E so you get the picture from and there's a grassy median in between these two highways. And suddenly in my headlights I notice someone up ahead on the highway and I see this woman, she's crossing from the passenger side over towards, I guess the driver's side that way. And she wasn't lit up or anything. But I want to tell you right now that I have thought about this many times since those years past and it doesn't make sense that I saw all the detail that I did, but I did, I did see it. I don't know if she wanted me to see, but here's what I saw. There was a lady, never did turn around to look at me, but she had on a bonnet, she had on a long flowing skirt. I did not see any feet. She had on like a long sleeve jacket that ended at her waist. If you could picture a Laura Ingalls Little House on the Prairie type person, except she was a lady, a grown woman, you know, probably my height, 5 6, 5 7. As I'm traveling towards her, you know, I'm just mesmerized because it's 1990, it's in August and it's around 6 o' clock in the morning. And plus I'm barreling towards her at 55 mile an hour and I saw all this detail. I'll never forget it. I don't know what it was, was, it looked human. I did not see any feet. And I know what you're thinking, well, how did you see this? I've asked myself that many times before. I don't know, it's almost as if time slowed down. Does that make sense? I don't know. It's like there she was and she crossed and she made it across the road before I reached her. And I looked back and it's like when I passed her, she was just like a. I don't know, you could see through her. But like I said, I was passing her, you know, really fast. But when I looked in my rearview mirror, I couldn't see anything that I've never forgotten that I've only told a couple of people. I know it sounds crazy. How could I have seen this lady? I mean, how could I have? But I did. I don't know if that kind of, you know how I've heard of Resurrection Mary, like she glows. This lady didn't glow, but she wanted me to see her and I saw her. I saw all that detail. I don't know if maybe the area we live in, you know, at one time maybe she may have been a pioneer, I don't know. I've always wanted to research that area to see if there was any record of anything happening when times passed. But you know, this area, there's always probably Something happening. I'm not sure who she was or what she was, but I saw her and I love the podcast. I listen every week. Keep up the good work. Anyway, bye.

I am calling from the Show Me State. I live in Independence, Missouri. I was on my way home back from work around 5:53pm on Friday, September 26th. I was wearing sunglasses and I was looking up at the sky through them. My windshield. There's no tint on my windshield. And I saw a silvery thing in the air, like flying. And I thought it might be a helicopter or some kind of airplane because there's a lot of airplanes around here. And then I took my sunglasses off to look at it again and it was still there. And then I sat back and was thinking, huh, wouldn't that be cool if it just disappeared or took off? And then I looked back up and it was gone. That was less than 2 seconds or so. And if it was a helicopter or airplane, it wouldn't have gone too far from the area. So maybe it was one of those things where the plane turned away and the sun would stop shining on it. I'm not sure, but it just happened to me. I was so excited to call, but I decided to wait and pull over. But that's my story.

I started on this trail because the Yellow Astor Butte splits off onto Tommy Hoy Peak Trail. So I was still on the Yellow Astor Butte and it was kind of a rainy, overcast day and on my way into the trail I saw one man on his way out. We said hi and I kept on going and there was nobody out there. I've been on this trail one time before, but it was even more cloudy and overcast and foggy the first time, so it felt like a new trail. And about a mile, a mile and a half in, it's not above tree line, but the trees clear out a little bit and it's kind of like this counterclockwise C shape that you end up hiking around this valley and you get a clear shot right across the valley and it's so beautiful. But I'd gotten above treeline and as I was hiking I was kind of having this Bit of a fantasy as a solo hiker, not listening to music, I just let my imagination run. And I was thinking about how neat it would be if my sister were out here with me. Because my sister and I, we don't talk anymore, and I was just kind of missing her. And then I was thinking about how neat it would be if we were walking along and all of a sudden an alien appeared in front of us. And the alien tells us, you know, you're one of us and you get to come home with me. And I was thinking about how much of a relief that would be of, like, okay, all right. Like, something had to be up. So I was just kind of enjoying that fantasy a little bit. And then all of a sudden, to my left in the air, and if I look to the left, I can see across the valley to the other side where the trail meets. I heard a turkey gobble. Like the most classic silly turkey gobble up in the air. And I look up into the sky and I see two turkey vultures. And in the moment, I didn't put it together that that is a ridiculous thing to happen. That's normal.

I live in Indiana, so this is kind of like a two part story. What happened was that me and my wife were taking a ghost tour in Indiana near the Culberson mansion. And one of the stories is that a local police officer got a call about the alarm inside the Culberson mansion that I kept going off. So he went inside, checked it out and he saw a woman in black just walking. He was thinking it was one of the actors from the Culberson mansion, like doing like the history tour or something like that. Then he Talked to the manager and he asked, hey, is one of your workers still here? And the manager goes, what worker? Woman was dressed up in black. And he goes, oh, you seen the Woman in black? Mrs. Culberson herself. The other part of the story is that I was out with some friends around that area, and I was like, you know what? I'm gonna drive past the Culberson mansion just to see if I, you know, see anything. Well, I drove past, parked it for about not even to, like a minute. All the lights were out except for one. And there was a black silhouette just staring down. I couldn't even see it. The blinds were in front. But I just have this eerie feeling that it was her. It was a very scary moment. Heck, I have goosebumps just by talking about it as well. And.

This story comes from when I was living up Pennsylvania. I'd say it was 2017 and it was hunting season, late November, early December. I was hunting at a farm that my father in law and I used to go to. And this morning I was just going by myself. I was off of work in the middle of the week, but I decided to go hunting out there. So I went out to the Grego farm out in Pennsylvania and I went down to a tree stand spot that I'd picked out earlier in the season. I say I roughly got there about 5:00 in the morning, got up into my tree stand and I was just sitting there facing the open cornfield. And behind me was a very large sinkhole they used to refer to as the quarry. And there was a small stream that used to run back behind there. But while I was sitting there, I used to know the pretty normal sounds that went on around that farm. I've been there a couple times, so it was just like any other normal morning. And then for some reason I was up in my stand and all of a sudden I got a sense that something else was there. I didn't know exactly what it was and everything seemed to get dead quiet. Then I got hit in the face with this odor and it kind of smelled like a wet animal, wet dog, something of that nature. And the hairs on the back of my neck stood up and I was, for the first time in a long time, I was really scared and I felt that something was looking at me. I didn't look to see what it was. I didn't want to. In the back of my mind it was saying, you don't want to see it, you don't want it to see you see it. I sat there in the stand for a few minutes and then finally seemed a sense of whatever was there went away. I don't know what it was, I didn't see it. But that's my story. What was it? I don't know. But it was so real to me that as soon as day broke I got down out of the stand. I didn't even sit around to wait to go hunting. And I just got back in my truck and I went home. Thank you.

Allstate Anonymous My story has to do with the passing of my mom. She passed away in our home. She had cancer and she fought bravely for many months. But eventually she passed away on a hospital bed that we had downstairs in our living room. The night that she passed, they ended up taking her to a type of morgue. But she had passed away and she stayed in the house for a little while. We had family come and pay their respects. And so that night I ended up sleeping upstairs in her. I just wanted to, I guess, feel close to her. So I went to sleep in her bed. Sometime there during the night, I got up and I went to the kitchen. And so to get to my kitchen, you had to go down some stairs and then to the left. When you finally got to the main floor, if you looked to the left, that was the living room. Straight ahead was the kitchen. And as I was passing the living room, I glanced over to the left and I saw what. I don't know how to describe it, but it was like a black mat. It was blacker than black. And it was just like this kind of a blob just there in the living room, right where she had passed, this dark, dark mass. And I remember looking at it and being like, okay, that's weird. And there were no lights on, but there was lights from the outside. And, you know, you could kind of see the furniture and that. But that particular area was very dark. And I just kind of went to the kitchen, got something, I can't remember what. And I went back upstairs and actually just kind of went back to bed. At some point during the night, my brother wakes me up. Now, my brother slept in the basement. Wakes me up, scares the bejesus out of me. He's standing in the doorway. At this point, we're grown adults. And he says to me, I can't sleep. I can't sleep downstairs. I said, why? And he says to me, well, I can see like a black mass seeping down into my room, coming from above. And above his room, and that he lived in the basement, was the living room. So he was seeing whatever I was seeing from below. Until very recently, I didn't know this, but we talked about it again. My mom passed about 11 years ago, and he told me when he saw that seeping down, he went upstairs and he went to the living room and looked the same area that I was looking at. He told me that he not only saw a dark mass, but he could see like a sparkling, like a stardust swirling within that dark mass. He said that the feeling he got from wasn't good. He always felt like it could have been maybe some kind of opening of some kind of portal or something, but just mind boggling because I saw it and he saw it. Anyways, love your show.

I was recently listening to the season 7 episode 19, grab bag episode fairly far behind, but it describes a disembodied hand and it kind of brought up a memory that I had pushed away for a while because it pretty much Fs with my reality, if that makes sense. So I was in the car with two of my siblings, my younger brother and my younger sister, and I was driving them home from youth group. So this would have been probably eight or nine at night, pretty dark. And we were just driving down the highway and we were about to get on the exit ramp and I saw something in my headlights just in the middle of the exit ramp, very low to the ground. I couldn't quite make it out until we got up close to it. But as we got up close to it, I could see that it was a disembodied hand. And I had zero idea what I was looking at. I was completely dumbfounded. And I slow down and we literally have to wait for this thing to cross as it just walks in front of us across the exit ramp and into the ditch. And I mean, as you can imagine, my siblings and I just completely freaked out. We were just like, what in the hell was that? Was that a hand? We were just completely freaked out. We had no idea what was going on and we just drove away as if nothing happened.

So I was just listening to episode 17 of season 17 and the disembodied voices calling a name brought up an old memory I'd completely forgot. So this had been 2003. I was working the late shift in an all night gas station, and it was just me by myself. And I'm kind of milling about the store, just facing stock, dusting, you know, just regular stuff. And I'm bent down dusting a shelf. And then out of nowhere, it sounds like somebody came up to the left side of me and goes, seven right in my ear. Now this is so loud, I actually jumped up. I was kneeling down at the shelf and I jumped straight up, stood, looked around, thought, okay, somebody just snuck up on me. And it's a fairly small all night gas station, so there wasn't a lot of room to hide. So walked all around the store, didn't see anybody. None of the door chimes had gone off to let me know that anybody had come in or gone out. It was just very strange. That's the only time in my life that's ever happened that I've heard a disembodied voice call my name. And like I said, it was so loud, it actually made me physically jump up. Now, I will say to this, I do suffer from audio pareidola. For those of you that don't know, my brain will tune into white noise and tries to make it sound coherent sound. So sometimes it'll sound like music where you just can't quite catch the lyrics. Sometimes it'll sound like muffled conversation, but never has it ever been clearly audible and sounded just like my name. Now, I will say that at the time I was working in this gas station, there was no piped in music. There is nothing particularly loud. Just me in the quiet. Anyways, Derek, just thought I would share.

I've been a long time listener of the show, like literally since season one. But I have been recently catching back up. So I'm in season 19 and there's been a couple of stories about faceless entities and I wanted to call in my own story. So I'm from Michigan and I live downriver. The house that I lived in had I could not even count how many odd happenings, ghost sightings of everyone who visited. But the one that I'm going to talk about today is the faceless woman I would see both in dreams and when I was awake. It was always a very benign kind of experience, but it was very odd. The most notable time that I ever had anything happen, I woke up at night and I slept in the basement of my parents house. So it was always very dark and pretty cold. As it was. But I woke up from a dead sleep for whatever reason, and sat up and looked around, trying to see if maybe the dog was making a sound or somebody had done something in the house and they didn't see anything. But when I turned to the other side of my bed, there was a woman sitting there. She had long black hair, like a red dress with a white apron. And even in the moment, I thought it was very odd that I could make out all these details because it was so dark. But when she turned to me, she had no face, like, no facial features at all. It was just like a blank slate of where a face should be. And her whole appearance, all of it seems to glow. Like I could make out all these details despite it being very dark. And she just kind of turned and looked at me and then patted the end of the bed as if like to tell me, go back to sleep. Like, you know, you would do for a kid. Like, you just pat the pillow. For whatever reason I did, I just laid back down and went back to sleep. And I would have never thought to tell this story, except for a couple years later at a sleepover, all of us were telling scary stories. You know, we were watching the horror movies and telling scary stories that we had experienced or whatever. And one of my friends told the exact same story. They said they woke up one night and there was just a woman sitting on the bed. Explained her the exact same way. Long, long black hair, red dress, with a white apron and no face. And I thought that was so weird. So I had to tell them that. And then hearing these stories be told Both in season 18, I think, episode 47 and season 19, I don't remember what episode. I just thought it was very interesting that this was something that occurred to a lot of people. So I just wanted to go ahead and share my story. Keep up the awesome work.

I want to call this in anonymously from Arizona, but this story actually happened in Idaho about five years ago. So I was near Ketchum, which is close to Sun Valley, hunting black bears and wolves with my dad, and both of us saw just a really strange animal. The best way that I can describe it is was they had the body of like a Himalayan tar, which if you look up what a Himalayan tar looks like, they're like a goat almost. They got very furry body, like a muskox. They had the body of that, but it had like the head of almost a moose. Like, I've seen basically every animal that could be found in that area. I've seen mountain goats, I've seen bighorn sheep. I've seen wolves, black bears, moose, elk. This was none of those. This was something I had never seen. And initially, since we first saw it in the early morning, I thought this was just a mountain goat that looked weird because of the lighting. But as the day drove on and we continued to watch this thing, we realized this is not a mountain goat. This is something entirely different. Now, if this had happened in like, say, New Mexico, I could have just thought, oh, that's just the Himalayan tar, because they do have a feral population of tar there. But this happened in the mountains of Idaho in fall. We don't have tar here, and mountain goats, to my knowledge, aren't normally brown. So I just thought I'd call that in. If anybody else from Idaho has experienced something like that and know what that could have been, I would appreciate knowing. It's confused me for years.

This story comes from when I was living up Pennsylvania. I'd say it was 2017 and it was hunting season, late November, early December. I was hunting at a farm that my father in law and I used to go to. And this morning I was just going by myself. I was off of work in the middle of the week, but I decided to go hunting out there. So I went out to the Grego farm out in Pennsylvania and I went down to a tree stand spot that I'd picked out earlier in the season. I'd say I roughly got there about 5:00 in the morning, got up into my tree stand and I was just sitting there facing the open cornfield. And behind me was a very large sinkhole they used to refer to as the quarry, and there was a small stream that used to run back behind there. But while I was sitting there, I used to know the pretty normal sounds that went on around that farm. I've been there a couple times, so it was just like any other normal morning. And then for some reason I was up in my stand and all of a sudden I got a sense that something else was there. I didn't know exactly what it was and everything seemed to get dead quiet. Then I got hit in the face with this odor and it kind of smelled like a wet animal, wet dog, something of that nature. And the hairs on the back of my neck stood up and I was, for the first time in a long time I was really scared and I felt that something was looking at me. I didn't look to see what it was. I didn't want to, in the back of my mind was saying, you don't want to see it, you don't want it to see you see it. I sat there in the stand for a few minutes and then finally it seemed a sense of whatever was there went away. I don't know what it was, I didn't see it. But that's my story. What was it? I don't know. But it was so real to me that as soon as day broke I got down out of the stand. I didn't even sit around to wait to go hunting. And I just got back in my truck and I went home.

I'll state anonymous My story has to do with the passing of my mom. She passed away in our home. She had cancer and she fought bravely for many months. But eventually she passed away on a hospital bed that we had downstairs in our living room. The night that she passed they ended up taking her to a type of morgue, but she had passed away and she stayed in the house for a little while. We had family come and pay their respects and so that night I ended up sleeping upstairs in her bed. I Just wanted to, I guess, feel close to her. So I went to sleep in her bed. Sometime there during the night, I got up and I went to the kitchen. And so to get to my kitchen, you had to go down some stairs and then to the left. When you finally got to the main floor, if you looked to the left, that was the living room. Straight ahead was the kitchen. And as I was passing the living room, I glanced over to the left and I saw what. I don't know how to describe it, but it was like a black mass. It was blacker than black. And it was just like this kind of a blob just there in the living room, right where she had passed, this dark, dark mass. And I remember looking at it and being like, okay, that's weird. And there were no lights on, but there was lights from the outside. And you know, you could kind of see the furniture and that. But that particular area was very dark. And I just kind of went to the kitchen, got something, I can't remember what. And I went back upstairs and actually just kind of went back to bed. At some point during the night, my brother wakes me up. Now, my brother slept in the basement. Wakes me up, scares the bejesus out of me. He's standing in the doorway. At this point, we're grown adults. And he says to me, I can't sleep, I can't sleep downstairs. I said, why? And he says to me, well, I can see like a black mass seeping down into my room, coming from above. And above his room and that he lived in the basement, was the living room. So he was seeing whatever I was seeing from below. Until very recently, I didn't know this, but we talked about it again. My mom passed about 11 years ago. And he told me when he saw that seeping down, he went upstairs and he went to the living room and looked same area that I was looking at. He told me that he not only saw darkness mass, but he could see like a sparkling, like a stardust swirling within that dark mass. He said that the feeling he got from wasn't good. He always felt like it could have been maybe some kind of opening of some kind of portal or something, but just mind boggling because I saw it and he saw it. Anyways. Love your show.

I was recently listening to the season 7 episode 19, grab bag episode fairly far behind, but it describes A disembodied hand. And it kind of brought up a memory that I had pushed away for a while because it pretty much Fs with my reality, if that makes sense. So I was in the car with two of my siblings, my younger brother and my younger sister, and I was driving them home from youth group. So this would have been probably eight or nine at night, pretty dark. And we were just driving down the highway and we were about to get on the exit ramp and I saw something in my headlights just in the middle of the exit ramp, very low to the ground. I couldn't quite make it out until we got up close to it. But as we got up close to it, I could see that it was a disembodied hand. And I had zero idea what I was looking at. I was completely dumbfounded. And I slow down and we literally have to wait for this thing to cross as it just walks in front of us across the exit ramp and into the ditch. And I mean, as you can imagine, my siblings and I just completely freaked out. We were just like, what in the hell was that? Was that a hand? We were just completely freaked out. We had no idea what was going on and we just drove away as if nothing happened.

So I was just listening to episode 17 of season 17 and the disembodied voices calling a name brought up an old memory I'd completely forgot. So this had been 2003. I was working the late shift in an all night gas station and it was just me by Myself, and I'm kind of milling about the store, just facing stock dusting, you know, just regular stuff. And I'm bent down dusting a shelf. And then out of nowhere, it sounds like somebody came up to the left side of me and goes, seven right in my ear. Now this is so loud, I actually jumped up. I was kneeling down at the shelf and I jumped straight up, stood, looked around, thought, okay, somebody just snuck up on me. And it was a fairly small all night gas station, so there wasn't a lot of room to hide. So walked all around the store, didn't see anybody. None of the door chimes had gone off to let me know that anybody had come in or gone out. It was just very strange. That's the only time in my life that's ever happened that I've heard a disembodied voice call my name. And like I said, it was so loud, it actually made me physically jump up. Now, I will say to this, I do suffer from audio pareidola. For those of you that don't know, my brain will tune into white noise and tries to make it sound coherent sound. Though sometimes it'll sound like music, music where you just can't quite catch the lyrics. Sometimes it'll sound like muffled conversation, but never has it ever been clearly audible and sounded just like my name. Now, I will say that at the time I was working in this gas station, there was no piped in music. There was nothing particularly loud. Just me in the quiet. Anyways, Derek, just thought I would share.

I've been a long time listener of the show, like literally since season one, but I have been recently catching back up. So I'm in season 19 and there's been a couple of stories about faceless entities and I wanted to call in my own story. So I'm from Michigan and I live downriver. The house that I lived in had I could not even count how many odd happenings, ghost sightings of everyone who visited. But the one that I'm going to talk about today is the faceless woman I would see both in dreams and when I was awake. It was always a very benign kind of experience, but it was very odd. The most notable time that I ever had anything happen, I woke up at night and I slept in the basement of my parents house. So it was always very dark and pretty cold as it was. But I woke up from a dead sleep for whatever reason and sat up and looked around trying to see if maybe the dog was making a sound or somebody had done something in the house and they didn't see anything. But when I turned to the other side of my bed, there was a woman sitting there. She had long black hair like a red dress with a white apron. And even in the moment I thought it was very odd that I could make out all these details because it was so dark. But when she turned to me, she had no face, like no facial features at all. It was just like a blank slate of where a face should be. And her whole appearance, all of it seems to glow. Like I could make out all these details despite it being very dark. And she just kind of turned and looked at me and then patted the end of the bed as if, like to tell me to go back to sleep. Like you know you would do for a kid. Like you just pat the pillow. For whatever reason I did, I just laid back down and went back to sleep and. And I would have never thought to tell this story except for a couple years later at a sleepover. All of us were telling scary stories. You know, we were watching the horror movies and telling scary stories that we had experienced or whatever. And one of my friends told the exact same story. They said they woke up one night and there was just a woman sitting on the bed. Explained her the exact same way. Long black hair, red dress, with a white apron and no face. And I thought that was so weird. So I had to tell them that. And then hearing these stories be told Both in season 18, I think, episode 47 and season 19, I don't remember what episode. I just thought it was very interesting that this was something that occurred to a lot of people. So I just wanted to go ahead and share my story. Keep up the awesome work.

However, even though I'm calling from Virginia, my story actually takes place in Massachusetts. The South Shore. That's the area between Boston and the Cape. And this took place in the 90s. I was a teenager at the time, like an older teenager. I was in a car with my dad and my stepmother. And it was about dusk, and we were driving to my mom's place where my dad was gonna drop me off. Suddenly my dad's like, what's that? I see something in the sky. I look out the window and I think it's like a low flying aircraft. At first, however, my dad's kind of spooked. And the thing is, my dad is not an easy to spook type of guy. He has, like, a background in science, so he is very skeptical about these things. But it scared him enough that he pulled over, he got out of the car, and my stepmother can see it because she's, like, sitting next to him. And I'm in the back. I can't quite see it. She's like, tommy, please don't go. Don't go out there and look. My dad was just like, I want to know what that is. So he got out of the car and he starts staring up at the sky. I can't get a really good look at it. So I get out. My stepmother is protesting, but I want to see what my dad's looking at. As I get out, I see. At first, like I said, I thought it was an aircraft, but it was not a plane. It couldn't have been a plane. It was hexagon shaped and it was very big. And I could see kind of some lights blinking, which is why I thought it was a plane at first. But I knew it definitely wasn't a plane because of how low it was flying and how big it was. And also, there was this, like, vent on the back of it that had this pulsing glow that was coming from it, like it was magma or something like that. Something just slowly glowing, like switching from glowing red to glowing orange and back again. That really frightened me. But I couldn't stop staring at it because I really wanted to figure out what it was. And my dad was just kind of frozen in disbelief himself. And we just watched it, and it kind of hovered over us for a little bit before it headed on. We couldn't hear anything. Then we saw it just kind of disappear below the tree line. So we got in and my dad didn't mention it. He didn't talk about it. He never mentioned it again. And my stepmother started to, but my dad cut her off and we just kind of drove on. I always still think about that UFO to this day. I could never tell you what it is, and I still think about it. My dad never mentioned it. My dad passed in 2016 and I kind of wish I asked him about it if he ever figured out what it was. But I think since he couldn't explain it and figure it out, he preferred just to kind of ignore it. But I'm kind of the opposite. I kind of wanted to know more about it. There is a redux to this story. Like a part two. I was just visiting with my brother over the weekend and I was telling him about this because I'd never told him about this UFO story before. And he grew white when I told it to him. And he said, that's very strange that you tell this story. And I was like, why? And he's like a friend of mine, this older guy, he owned like an independently owned store down the harbor. And apparently this older guy said that he believed in UFOs. He had seen three UFOs in the same area from the time he was a child until he was an adult. And he saw it three times and it was always near the beach. Where we were was kind of near the beach. It wasn't quite on the beach, but it was near the beach. And he had said that it was hexagon shaped and that kind of, you know, it leans credence to my story. It kind of made me feel like, oh, so what I saw was maybe not that unusual after all. I'd be curious to hear if there's anybody else that had UFO sightings, especially hexagon shaped UFOs in the South Shore area of Massachusetts. I did look in Project Blue Book, the stuff that was released, and I saw reference to a UFO in my hometown where I saw this UFO in the 60s. I can't remember if I recalled it being hexagon shaped or not, but it was at the beach. And I always, when my brother mentioned it, I was wondering if that was the same one that this older gentleman shopkeeper had mentioned. Anyways, love the podcast.

My name is Bird and I'm from Los Angeles, California. The Silver Lake area, to be very specific. My husband is a location manager and we were on location in Santa Paula, California around 2007. We were staying at the Glen Tavern Inn, which has a historical participation in a horrible tragedy. A dam burst close by a long.\n\n[Speaker C] Time ago in the early 1900s and a lot of people died.\n\n[Speaker B] And the Glen Tavern Inn became a refuge for survivors. It wasn't as if situation.\n\n[Speaker C] Plus there were two murders in the hotel.\n\n[Speaker B] I believe one was a prostitute and that was in 307. That's a very, very known haunted room.\n\n[Speaker C] And then one was a gambler Lost his life.\n\n[Speaker B] Oh, and by the way, I knew.\n\n[Speaker C] All about this place historically and paranormally.\n\n[Speaker B] Prior before walking in. So we had to stay three nights and the first two were sent in.\n\n[Speaker C] The renovated suite where there was no activity whatsoever.\n\n[Speaker B] I actually walked the halls at midnight.\n\n[Speaker C] Using my phone looking for paranormal trouble and I found none.\n\n[Speaker B] Anyway, so on the last night of our stay, we were in the room.\n\n[Speaker C] Directly below where the murder of the.\n\n[Speaker B] Prostitute occurred, which was 207. I heard some talk about her head.\n\n[Speaker C] Being removed, her body, but I don't know.\n\n[Speaker B] I was a smoker at the time and an insomniac. I awoke about 5 o' clock to go downstairs outside to smoke and sit in the lobby afterwards. Is grand, all dark hardwood everywhere.\n\n[Speaker C] It was really beautiful hotel.\n\n[Speaker B] I lounged about the lobby because it was busy with people and activities as well as being pretty. Even though I was not participating in the activities, it was fun to watch. The first people were early birds running to catch their hot air balloons, which is an annual activity. Then the second thing that happened was this big travel bus that said Antelope Valley Paranormal Investigators or something like that. I talked to a few of the participants people on the bus for a long time, about an hour and a half. And we had a lot in common. Especially when I mentioned a fairly famous local English medium named Brian. I forgot his last name. And he was just so fabulous.\n\n[Speaker C] And we all confirmed our love for him.\n\n[Speaker B] So now I return to my husband and I've been gone for two good hours. Smoking and talking and talking and smoking. When I came back, I was met with adoration and just like anxiety as well. He pulled me into the bed. He wanted to spoon. Now this was not the kind of man who showed his affection that way. He was affectionate. He would know, hold me and kiss me.\n\n[Speaker C] But he never wanted to really cuddle in bed. That was not his thing at all.\n\n[Speaker B] Anyway, so then he tells me what happened while I was gone. He had been somewhat of a skeptic. He claims he woke up with something and what he believed was my arm sticking straight up in the air under the covers. And he swatted it down only to find it was my king size pillow propped up perfectly straight under the COVID stiff and kept a blanket up like a tent. He was kind of freaked out. He was like what's this? Doesn't even know what to make of it. And he goes into nail quickly. So he shakes it off and goes to the bathroom. And when he comes back it's back up straight again under the covers. It completely freaked him out and he just didn't know what to do. And it was this old pillow on top of it. It was old and soft, so it's hard to be stiff. It's kind of impossible for it to be stiff.\n\n[Speaker C] Death under there.\n\n[Speaker B] So anyway, I'm so glad to share the story. Thank you for your hard work.

So I was near Ketchum, which is close to Sun Valley, hunting black bears and wolves with my dad, and both of us saw just a really strange animal. The best way that I can describe it was it had the body of like a Himalayan tar, which if you look up what a Himalayan tar looks like, they're like a goat almost. They got very furry body, like a muskox. They had the body of that, but it had like the head of almost a moose. Like, I've seen basically every animal that could be found in that area. I've seen mountain goats, I've seen bighorn sheep, I've seen wolves, black bears, moose, elk. This was none of those. This was something I had never seen. And initially, since we first saw it in the early morning, I thought this was just a mountain goat that looked weird because of the lighting. But as the day drove on and we continued to watch this thing, we realized this is not a mountain goat. This is something entirely different. Now, if this had happened in like say, New Mexico, I could have just thought, oh, that's just the Himalayan tar, because they do have a feral population of tar there. But this happened in the mountains of Idaho in fall. We don't have tar here. And mountain goats, to my knowledge, aren't normally brown. So I just thought I'd call that in. If anybody else from Idaho has experienced something like that and know what that could have been, I would appreciate knowing. It's confused me for years.

I live in Canada, in Quebec, kind of in a rural area in the Gatineau park area of Quebec. I'm calling today because I heard a story where someone had reported seeing something like a translucent bat, and it was the first time I Was kind of excited about what me and my husband had seen four or five years ago. So I thought I would tell my story and see if it was at all close to the same sighting. So my husband and I were visiting my parents in Ottawa, Ontario and they live in a, you know, not a suburban area. It's like quite city esque and an older neighborhood. And we were both smokers at the time. So we went outside after dinner with our drinks and we went out in the backyard, a tiny backyard, you know, close to all the other backyards. We sat out and had a cigarette and chatted. It was around probably 10:30pm, really nice night, not cloudy, fairly clear. I didn't notice it was windy or anything, although it's been a while now, so I can't remember too many details. And as we were chatting about God knows what, I look up to my left above the horizon like beside my parents neighbor's house and I see this, what looks like a V shaped big pair of wings moving in this like kind of mechanical way, like they're flapping but they're like illuminated. I couldn't see really a body, just the wings, like the way you would like draw arches for a seagull. And I saw them and I told my husband, hey, do you see that? Like what is that? Is it a drone? And we look and he's dumbfounded and so am I. And we're just kind of looking at it. It's kind of shaky, flapping, mechanical, very high up in the sky, but not high enough where it would be like plane height, I can't gauge, maybe you know, 100ft, 150ft, I don't know. And it was moving away from us and then all of a sudden another one appeared right beside it, kind of in tandem and they were both flapping and moving away from us and we just watched them in total awe, having zero clue what it could be. It didn't look like a drone, it didn't look fully mechanical. It looked like it was, I don't know, almost like it was an animal. But also this illuminated, mechanical jerking motion. I've never seen anything like it. I've never seen anything like it again. And we both looked at each other and thought this is definitely a UFO of some kind. So I did tons of research to try and find any like Google description that might be the same. And I couldn't find anything at all that looked UFO wise like anything we had seen. And it was only when I heard that story about the kind of translucent bat sighting that I thought, oh, that's kind of really similar to, at least visually what we saw. I don't know if the motions were the same, but certainly visually sounded really similar. And when I saw the picture, I thought, okay, from far away, that's probably really similar to what we were looking at. So that's my story. I hope it's useful. Thanks again for everything. Have a great day.

When I was listening to the season 15 episode 4, actually the beyond portion for Patreon members, Caleb tells a story about out of body experiences when he was a child. And I couldn't believe it. I just had to call this story in because I completely can relate to his story. So this story I'm five or six years old and sleeping in my bed one night in my house and I woke up in the middle of the night. What woke me up was that I was tangled up in my sheets and my blanket and I was thrashing around in my bed trying to untangle myself from the sheets and the blanket. And I wasn't yelling out, I wasn't calling out for my mom yet, but I was just getting frustrated and awake and that I could not untangle myself. And so all of a sudden, the next thing I experience is that I'm no longer thrashing in the sheets. I'm up in the corner of my room, across the room, up in the corner, crunched up against the ceiling, and I'm looking down at my body, myself laying in the bed, thrashing around, trying to untangle from the sheets. So I'm up here floating. I remember that very specific feeling of floating in that corner, looking at myself on the bed and just watching and watching. I don't know how long I was floating there watching. And after a certain amount of time I recall that there is a being there with me. I knew there was someone there with me up in that corner. And I perceived this being just as like light or energy, whatever. And of course I was a spirit body. I probably didn't have any definition either. This being was communicating to me, you have to go back into your body. And and I did not want to. And being six years old and probably stubborn, I said no. And then they communicated to me again, you have to go back into your body. You have to go now. And I said, no, I don't want to. And the next thing I experience is that I'm right over my body, looking down at my head and my face. I've gotten my head and my face out of the blankets and my legs and my arms are starting to get untangled from the sheets and so I'm looking down at my head and thinking, how do I get back into my body? And I felt sort of a little bit scared. But I felt this being behind me and sort of my spirit body was pushing me from my shoulders into my physical body. I was fully aware at that time. So I could feel this sort of weird sensation of going from spirit body back into my physical body. And then that really creepy feeling. I mean, when I was six, I felt it was really creepy where you feel your fingers and your toes and your hands and your feet, they're so rubbery. And even my face, my skin, my tongue, my teeth, everything just felt so heavy and rubbery. It was just gave me the creeps. And at that point I was then fully back in my body and fully awake at that time. Then I was just really disappointed. I was scared and frustrated and I started calling for my mom and my mom came. Of course I did not tell her what had happened. I told her that I got tangled up in the sheets, but I didn't tell her exactly what had happened to me until I was about 55 years old. And I told her the story and it scared her, of course. But after that time, somehow I knew that I was not allowed to leave my body, have out of body experiences and leave my room. So after that time I would have my out of body experience. But I would only go to the either, you know, the ceiling of my room or I'd walk to the doorway, look out to the living room. But I never went further. I always knew that I was not allowed to leave my bedroom in an out of body experience. How did I know that? I really don't know. But I'd like to hear more people call in their stories of out of body

This story takes place in the early fall of 2016. I used to live a good bit west of town, on the southwestern border of the Saguaro National Monument, down a road called San Joaquin, off a street called Kai Anasasi. One night around one or two in the morning, I got up to use the restroom. And while standing there, I heard five knocks on the bathroom door, very loud and very distinct. Assuming it was the girlfriend I was living with at the time, needing to get into the bathroom. And being a half asleep myself, I said come in if you need to. And after no response, I said are you there? And after a second moment of no response, I went to the door, opened it and my girlfriend was waking up on the bed asking what that knocking sound was. Never found an explanation for that. It was just one of the weirdest things that have ever happened to me. A few days later I was sitting at a table alone in the house and a tupperware bowl slipped off the table as if someone hit the lip of the bowl going off the table. No explanation, but anyways, figured I'd call my wife and I love the show and spend many date nights out in the desert listening to MAU Keep up to go to work man.

Again, I'm giving you a call to tell you about the paranormal activity that has happened in the assisted living facility I used to work at. So this is in downtown Mesa, kind of where Mesa used to begin in Arizona and before it was an Assisted living facility. It was low income housing and basically it went out of business and assisted living company bought it. But a lot of crazy stuff happened there. And obviously assisted living facilities, a lot of people died. And so there'd always be so many paranormal activities that happened. Ghost sighting orbs on these security cameras. People would see a lady dressed in a white gown turn around a corner and when you turn to see which resident it was, there'd be nobody there. I've heard doors open and close. I've had my security screens just go, you know, off static and then just completely go black on me. I used to work through the reception desk. So I would be there from 4pm to midnight and we'd have alert bells going off like crazy. But the one that kind of got me was I had a resident come down around 11, 11:30, and at this time all the doors are locked to the building. Nobody's there except for the workers and myself. And she comes down and she goes, there's a little boy in my closet. You know, she's got dementia. So I'm thinking she's not seeing anything. But to make her feel better, I go up there to check. She was super freaked out and she's never had a issue where she's seen things or said she's seen things or anything like that. So I go up there and I go into her room. I'm looking around, we turn on all the lights. I'm like, I don't see anything. Huh. Like, I look in her closet. They're not very big closets, but I move all the clothes boxes, anything like that. Like, I don't see anybody in here. And it's not like they have like a space, you know, for an attic in the closet. Like some houses do nothing like that. So I turn off the lights, I help her into bed, and she's like, can you leave the bathroom light on for me? Because I'm scared. I'm like, absolutely. If you need anything, hit the buzzer and we'll come help. She says, okay. I turn on the bathroom light and I shut the door, you know, to her bedroom. And all of a sudden I hear a giggle, a little boy giggle. I open the door and I was like, are you laughing? She says, no, that was the little boy. He's back in the closet. I turn on all the lights again, don't see anything. And I'm like, do you want to come sit downstairs for a little bit and watch TV in the lounge? She says, no, I'm just going to try to sleep he just, he wants to play. And I'm like, okay. I shut the door again and again I hear the giggle like a little kid playing hide and seek. That, like, you walk into the room and they think you don't see them and they just start doing that giggle. And I hear it again and just. I had to leave the room. I was completely blown away. And one of the workers there that worked since the building had opened as an assisted living facility, I asked him about it. He goes, you know where our pond is, right? We have pretty cool looking little koi pond. And I said, yes, that used to be a pool. They cemented it up, covered it. A little boy had drowned there. And I'm like, you're making this up. There's no way that happened. There's no way. And he goes, why else would we have a little boy ghost? But I did some research on it and it actually turns out that a little boy had drowned in that pool. And that's why they cemented it up and made it into a koi pond. And that's why there's now little boy ghost that likes to play hide and seek in the resident's room. Love the podcast. Amazing.

It's one of the schools on the reservation. It's actually a private Catholic school, but I won't be saying the name of the school for privacy reasons. I attended there through my freshman. Through my senior year. And while I was there, there's actually stories about the school. So the school was built in 1902, and it used to be a boarding school for native children. And where the kids used to stay, it's, like, very on the top floor. It's now, like a sister's chapel. But like I said, it used to be, like, where the native kids used to stay. We get, like, tourists all the time to, like, come toward the school and all that stuff. And there was one story where they were staying there, and they said that they heard children laughing and, like, there was nobody there. And they said that one time a ball, like, just bounced out one of the room, and there was no kids up there because it's just, like, a tourist group of adults. So they don't know what it was. But I'm pretty sure it was one of the spirits of the children there that used to stay there. But this school is kind of built weird, too. It's on the side of, like, the elementary, and then there's a separate building for high schoolers. And that was in that building. And my science teacher, she said that one time her and her daughter were there. She was working after hours. She said nobody was there. And she said that she heard children laughing, like, running up and down the hall. And so she said that she went out and they look, and there was, like, nobody there at all. And so, like, maybe not too soon after that, like, she said she heard one of the lockers slam, like, so loud, and she heard kids laughing. After that, she said that her and her daughter, like, got up and ran and just didn't, like, go back. And she actually got in trouble because, you know, she was the only one in the building. She's supposed to lock up the school, but I guess it scared her that bad that she didn't lock up the building and she doesn't know what it was. So that's my story. Keep up the good work.

My story takes place in Tombstone, Arizona, probably, I'd say maybe about six years ago at the Birdcage Theater. So it was in December, around the time of my birthday, which is in the first part of December, and I decided to take a ghost tour of the Birdcage Theater because I figured, you know, it's been around for a while. It's got to be haunted. So, you know, the guide tells you different stories, and towards the end of the tour, they turn out all the lights, all the air conditioning. There's nothing on, no heater, no nothing. And you sit around a table. There's different equipment. And so she tells the story about where there was an act with a dog, and one of the patrons ends up shooting and killing the dog. And she says that the dog still haunts the Birdcage Theater, and she had little squeaky toys for the dog, and they weren't near me. And so I was just being funny and silly. And so I was like, here, boy, come here. Here, boy, come here. And the next thing I know, I'm bending forward. My lower back gets ice cold. And then I'm sitting down, so it's kind of like in the crook by my hip. I feel this pressure. My mom's sitting next to me, so I go to her, I go, mom, did you just touch me? And she goes, no, I didn't touch you. And so I just, you know, wrote it off as nothing. And then all of a sudden, I feel it again, and I get a little angry because I'm thinking, you know.\n\n[Speaker B] What'S going on here?\n\n[Speaker C] And so I go, mom, did you touch me? And she goes, no, I didn't touch you. And so I didn't think it was a ghost dog. Didn't think anything of it. So I went home and sat down, and then my dog came over to me and put his head right there in the exact same spot. And light bulb came on, and I went, oh, my God. It was the ghost dog that put its head on my lap. So that's my story. Thank you.

This was probably back in like 2008. I grew up in this spooky haunted house growing up, and we were super obsessed with the show called Tap and this like predated ghost Adventures. I think they had some overlap, but it was a really good show and they had an episode on Tombstone, Arizona, which is, you know, a really old ghost town Kind of pioneered the wild west here. So we were kind of inspired as a family to go visit this town and kind of get a feel. Because, you know, the show just was like really spooky. Anyway, so we go and if you don't know, Tombstone, there's this really old saloon building, I believe, or it's a theater building or whatever. It was definitely entertainment for sure. But it's this massive building and they turned it into a museum of sorts so that you could kind of get a feel of what life was like. And so we're walking into the lobby of this building and there's this kind of banister on the second floor with, you know, red velvet curtains in the back. And it was for, you know, the Aristocrats or whatever they're called, to kind of look down at us, which is kind of cool. So we go through the museum and it's like families going in one after another. Like you're taking the tour together, but not like as a group together. It's just kind of like you're walking behind a family, a family's walking behind you, whatever. So we're going in. There's this family behind us and, you know, we're all really excited. They also had two little kids and, you know, it was me and my little brother. So we're all just like ecstatic. Like, what if we see ghosts? Like, that would be so cool. This place is so spooky. Like, we're chatting. We get to the end of the tour and it has you exit back out of the lobby where the banister is, and me and my family are like so excited. We're going to go see the rest of the town. Like, that was the spooky. Blah, blah, blah. And the family behind us decides to take a picture with a digital camera. That's like when this was. And so they take the digital picture of themselves and all we hear behind us is a no way. And we turn around, we're like, what? Like, it was pretty loud. And they look at us and they're like, look. And we go to look at their picture. And sure, as in the banister above us, there was like an old timey woman ghost in the picture behind us. We were so jealous. We wanted that to be us so bad. We were just so excited to see a ghost. And the fact that it wasn't us that got the picture, we were so annoyed. But yeah, it was super cool to go see. And if you guys ever get a chance to hit up Tombstone, Arizona, please do. It's like totally awesome. Maybe you'll catch a ghost sighting. Pretty sick. So, thanks.

It's in East Mesa, Arizona. We've lived here about four months. Our first house, and the house seems to crack and pop when you're not in the front room all by itself. There is no plumbing in the area. It seems to happen when my husband is not here. It happens morning, it happens night. If you walk into the room, it stops. You can hear it from the bedroom. The dogs woke me up this morning, barking and growling at nothing again. I just wondered if anybody had had similar like somebody fussing around in their house when they're not in the room or teasing them. I know the house was built in 97 and the people that lived here before. I know her husband passed away. I don't know if in the house or not. I do refer to the popping as Walter playing around, but I don't know what else it could possibly be. It literally stops the minute you walk into the room. So kind of weird, kind of spooky. Definitely gets my heart rate going when the dog starts freaking out. So I thought I would drop it here and see what everybody thought about it. Thank you.

The story that I actually have here, it takes place in Glendale, Arizona. So the way that my family is, we're the kind of family that we always intentionally get on each other's nerves. Like, it's just what we do. We'll play pranks on each other, will, you know, push some buttons every now and then. But that's just our way of showing you that we love you. We may be picking on one another, but when it comes time to, you know, stand up and have each other's backs, that's always something you can rely on 100%. But we did have boundaries. Like, for instance, my younger brother, he was really, really self conscious about a stutter that he had when he was younger. So everything was fair game to pick on him with, except that. But everyone had a boundary, and that's going to be really, really important here. This house that we lived in actually was built in about 1963. We moved in at about 2007. So it already had its fair share of, you know, people come and go. Anyway, it's about 2007, Halo 3 literally just came out and we were ready for it. Like, my mom, she had actually bought five or six boxes of pizza that night. We had like some Code Red Mountain Dew. It was going to be an all night thing. So with that, I had just gotten home because I was playing basketball at the park and I was really starting to get into my faith in Christianity. I'm a Baptist Christian now. I was really, really getting into my faith at the time. Anyway, I noticed that as I'm walking through my room, everybody's ready. You know, my older brother, my younger brother and my sister, we all play cable together all the time. So when the third one came out, you know, we were ecstatic about that. But anyway, I get into the room and I immediately, I notice like this really strong putrid smell. I couldn't put my finger on it precisely, but it was one of those smells that just jammed your nostrils, you know. So I was like, oh my God. I'm like, what is that? Now to my left, I had my bed. And then I had like this little shelving unit right at the head of my bed where I usually kept all my things. And I also had like a cross, not a crucifix, a cross that I actually bought not too long before that. And I looked at and I'm instantly just livid. What I see when I look, it's like something out of a horror movie. The cross that I had was upside down. It's sitting on my shelving unit upside down, leaning, like against the wall. I'm livid. I come back into the living room where everybody's getting set up, hooking up the Xbox. I'm furious. I'm like, who was in my room? Everybody still straight face, looking at the game or looking at the TV screen. And I'm, who was in my room? And my older brother Francis, he's like, what are you talking about? Now, I didn't want to tell them because I didn't want anybody to be quick to claim credit for this prank. Now, the thing is, they knew this was my boundary. I kind of expressed that it's not something that I want to have made fun of and prodded with me, which is why I was so furious. And I'm just, who was in my bedroom? My young brother Pablo goes, dude, nobody was in your room. And I'm just not believing it. Again, Francis, like, what happened then? My mom obviously is here and she comes out, she goes, son, what's going on? You know, why are you yelling? I'm like, somebody was messing with myself in my room. Now, of course there was a possibility somebody was going to get in trouble, right? So everybody gets more defensive thoughts. Nobody was in your effing room, dude. Nobody was in your room. And it got to the point to where I'm just like, maybe no one was. Like, I'm just thinking to myself, maybe nobody actually was because the way that they also are, too. One telltale sign of theirs is somebody will start laughing or, you know, start getting really sarcastic about it. No one did. I'm like, oh, my God. And then I noticed when I look back on it, I'm like, there was a really strong smell. So obviously me being in my faith, I kind of figured what that was, started praying on it. Thank you so much for the show.

I have experienced spiritual stuff since I was really little. I'm gonna say about four or five. This particular one is pretty creepy. When I want to say about six years old, I woke up in the middle of the night just feeling like somebody was watching me. And it wasn't a lie, it was true. Because I look up and I'm staring straight at this lady just staring down at me, looking at me, like, very menacingly. She doesn't look familiar to me. I have no idea who she is. And it just, like, scared the crap out of me to the point where, you know, when you're little and you're scared, you cover your head with your blanket until you're, like, so hot, but you don't want to, like, breathe, basically. So you just pretty much fall back to sleep even though you're, like, hot and sweaty. So the next day I told my mom about it, and she tried to say, like, oh, it was me. I want to go check on you in your room. And I was like, no, this didn't look anything like you, mom. Like, you did not look scary at all. Definitely did not look like my mom, basically. And so I kind of brushed it aside. I would have that heavy feeling happen every now and then as I grew up. Fast forward to. I want to say I was like, in my teens. I would still get that presence every now and then, somebody sitting on my bed, have that lady appear peering over me again. Even as a teenager, I would still hide under my covers. I feel like she followed me around even after I moved out. So fast forward again until I want to say I was 22 or 23 years old. And this was around the time my great grandmother died. But by this time, I was no longer living in Tucson. I was living in San Diego. And this lady would visit me in my dreams. And this particular time, around the time when my great grandmother died, I felt like I had a dream of my great grandma. But it just didn't seem like it was her. It just seemed so off. And even in my dream, because it felt so realistic, because I was, like, laying down in my room. She was sitting on my bed, you know, sheep. Sheep. Like my great grandmother. But the only thing that looked different was her eyes. Like, her eyes were still Menacing and piercing. I even mentioned in my dream that her eyes were super piercing and her face went from kind to menacing, bearing teeth, grinning, almost evil. And she got a nail and stabbed it through my hand. And this is in my dream. And I woke up, sheer panic. And I am freaking out because my hand is in pain and this is from a dream. So how can you explain that? I cannot. And I luckily have never seen this lady again in my dreams. But when I got divorced and I moved back to Tucson, I felt her heavy presence in my childhood bedroom again, because that's where I was staying at the time. And something in me was just like, put a salt lamp in your room. So I put my salt lamp in my room. I turned my salt lamp on, and her presence just left. Like, quickly just left. And by this time I was working more on my spiritual practices of the metaphysics and whatnot. Like with crystals and salt lamps and sage and salt and whatnot. And I have not since felt her presence. I keep a felt lamp with me at all times. I have at least three in my home. Even my mom's ex boyfriend told me that her presence would come back if I even tried to not have a felt lamp. So I don't know. I can't explain where this lady has come from, why she chose to haunt me as a child and even follow me as an adult from one date to another. It's just very strange. But I want to thank you for your podcast. I want to thank my friend Ty for telling me about your podcast. Have a great night.

So 17 years ago, I lived in Phoenix, Arizona. I rented a modest home with a friend and there was spirit. I never saw anything, but I could feel it. And at that time I was about 19 years old and I had been through other situations where I knew that the prickly feelings on the back of my neck weren't just nerves. Something was there present with me. I never felt in danger. It felt weird knowing that it was there. But it was like we had made peace with each other. I felt like I was respectful of the space. And that's why that being or entity was okay with me being there. So I had dated a gentleman, and we were having dinner and a movie, movie at the house. And I had fallen asleep on the couch. In fact, I had taken a Benadryl and it completely knocked me out. Well, in the middle of the night, this guy was trying to wake me up. He had went to the bedroom to go to bed. And this guy was like 6 foot, ex, Navy, big, strong, tough guy. And he was trying really hard to wake me up. And I was so groggy because the Benadryl. And he said, you need to come to bed. And I'm like, what's going on? He says, there's something in your room, and I don't feel comfortable there. And I had known that something, you know, had been there for a while. And so I thought, oh, that's weird that he could feel it, but it doesn't sit well with him. So anyway, that guy and I broke up. And a couple of months later, I started dating the man that I would end up marrying. My husband. And we would get ready to go to bed, and he liked to have the TV on during the nighttime, and I didn't like doing that. And I had asked him time and time again, hey, I can't sleep with the TV on. And he had pain, and so he was like, no, I'm gonna. With the TV on. You'll be fine. Go to sleep. Well, my routine prior to him was to turn on the radio, but only turn it on as low as I could hear the music. And it'd be completely dark and peaceful, except for that small sound of the radio. Well, I'd argued with him for about 15 minutes. Pretty soon, TV went off, radio went on to the lowest setting possible, and we were in the dark. And Brian, my future husband, goes, well, I guess we're going to sleep with her radio on. The ghost was sticking up for me, obviously, and I thought that was pretty cool. One more thing that had happened while in that house, that was a pretty pivotal time in my life. I was really trying to figure out who I was. And I was dabbling in some really hardcore drug use. And in between those two scenarios that I just mentioned, I had had some drugs stashed in the house. And originally I had stashed them in my bedroom. And for one reason or another, I didn't feel comfortable keeping them there. So I had moved them. I believe I had moved them to the kitchen somewhere where it was kind of close to the garage, but not near where I was sleeping. One day I went to go to bed, and I could not go to sleep. And something was bothering me so deeply. And every time I close my eyes, I imagine these drugs. And I finally said, okay, I've got to do something about this. And I got up. It was middle of the night, and the darkness and the fear that was gripping me was very intense. And I went to where I had stashed these drugs and I destroyed them and I got rid of them. And I really felt like it was that spirit urging me to do the right thing. And what was really peculiar about it, in all these instances, I never felt like I was in harm's way, even though some of the things that happened were weird and a little freaky. But I always felt safe. So, anyway, I just thought I would share that. I've been thinking about that for a while. I just really appreciate you and what you do.

I was actually just hearing the podcast girl Ash called regarding the lights in the sky. Well, I have seen that too. I live around the area where she had described that she was driving. I was sitting outside one evening, this must have been maybe about eight, nine years ago. My cousin and I were sitting on a porch and while she was talking to me, I had seen some lights in the sky and they were appearing, fading out. I didn't see anything that they were coming up from the ground. It was definitely in the sky. Now, where it was coming from, there's a huge telescope. So I don't know if that has anything to do with it. I told my cousin, look, there's going to be some lights that appear there. So she looked really quick and she saw them. They appeared and all of a sudden they bursted into maybe eight to 10 different lights and just disappeared altogether. So I did want to validate that I've seen what she's seen before. Thank you so much. I love this podcast so much. I've listened to it for years and I've gotten my sisters all on this podcast.

I don't know if it counts as a paranormal story or supernatural. It's more of a light hearted and warming thing. It happened just a second ago, so I'm wanting to recall it as I felt it. But on my way to work I got into the parking lot and I sat in my car for a second just to breathe and get ready to go in and everything. And the sun is obviously right in front of me. I'm facing the east and it's coming up and it's just, I close my eyes and it hits me in such a way that I don't think I've ever felt the sun before. And this really warm and bright white light came onto me and I started to feel myself almost like ascending. And I honestly thought, is this what it feels like to die? And that kind of pulled me back in because obviously I wasn't dying and I'm not in any shape or position to be. But it was just so peaceful and heartwarming and I felt loved ones on the other side and I kind of wanted it to be the way I go. So anyway, thanks so much for the podcast.

Just wanted to share something that happened, oh, I guess a couple weeks ago now. It's currently the middle of July. I live in Northern Arizona, not far from the Navajo reservation. Whether or not that comes into play here, I don't know. But it was the middle of the night and I had woken up. And during the summer, the room that I have, I have a balcony. So I usually leave that door open. And then the screen door closed to let in the cooler air. And I woke up and something just didn't feel right. I don't know, something told me to just close the door, Just, you know, shut it and, you know, maybe not use a blanket. But I shut the door. And I remember being very still and calm outside. It was silent, which was kind of weird because I live very close to Interstate 40. And I can hear, you know, cars coming and going, and it's pretty much going at all hours of the night. But it was just. It was dead silent. And I was just thinking, well, that's weird. I shut the door and I figured, well, I'll forget about this and go back to sleep. Just kind of laid in bed, kind of tossing and turning. Maybe 30 minutes went by and I went up to get a glass of water. Maybe just kind of calm my nerves a little. As I stood up again, I heard this really loud sort of whooshing sound. Not really a strong wind gust, just this really loud whoosh. And I looked out the window, didn't see anything, and thought, well, that was strange. Just didn't really think anything of it until I heard this. Sort of. The best way I can describe it is kind of like a slopping noise, I guess, like a dog would make, you know, if it sees something that it wants to eat and it kind of like licks its chops, you know. And I thought that was strange, but my roommate has a pretty big dog, so I just figured it was him, you know, outside the door or something. But anyway, I decided to walk into my bathroom to fill up a cup from the sink. And there's another window on the way to the bathroom. And as I walked past it, I noticed these two kind of neon yellow colored eyes just kind of peering in. And at first I thought it was just my mind playing tricks on me. You know, my nerves are all amped up. And so I just was like, yeah, don't worry about it. It wasn't there. So I go and I give him a drink of water, and I come back around and it was still there. It was rather unsettling. Not just because there was something peering into my window, but I also live on the third floor. So, yeah, I shut the curtains and just said a quick prayer and just kind of told it to get out. But that's my story. Thanks for everything you do with the show. Really appreciate it.

And this story takes place in Coshocton County, Ohio, close to New Bedford, actually. My family owns property down there. I'm 43. My whole life, I've been going down there till about 2011. Little disagreement happened and I haven't been there since, except for a couple times. But that's where I used to deer hunt. Spent a lot of times in the woods as a kid. My Friend, me and him from high school. We still hunt together. And it's a December night. If anyone hunts, knows gun season after Thanksgiving. And this particular winter, maybe.09 or 10. I don't really remember the way the family's property is set up on some acreage. There was a house and barn built in the late 1800s, and they were owned by Amish. And then my grandfather bought it in 1962, I believe. And then there was a new addition put on in 81. And as it was, me and my friend were sitting in the basement. Simple ceramic stone foundation basement. We had free gas, so the gas was always on. It was always warm in there. You know, it was a lower level. You could walk right in downstairs. And as it got darker there, no water, no electricity, it would just get dark. And it was snowing very hard. And you know, me and him were always big on going out to deer hunt and no issues there. And we decided that day we weren't going to do it. We were going to have our beers downstairs before we went to get something to eat. We were just downstairs and I remember thinking in my head, I'm hearing this music coming from upstairs. It's like the 1920s music. I don't know how to describe it, just that. Not really a twang, just that 1920s kind of music. And I'm hearing this upstairs, and I don't say anything to him. I just think it's our radio upstairs. We always had a radio that would run off batteries and we would turn it on. You get some of the local stations, and we go to leave and, you know, it's pitch black. We got our flashlights as we're going upstairs. I said, dude, you leave the radio on? And he says, no, I didn't leave the radio on. I said, you didn't leave the radio on? He's like, no. I was like, I've been hearing this music, this old music, like as long as we've been down here just hanging out. And he's like, I didn't leave the radio on. And we both go upstairs and I walk right over to the radio, and the radio is completely off. And I look at him. I was like, I was really hearing some strange music, like old music. And he looks at me, goes, I heard the same thing. But neither one of us had said anything about it, like, to each other until that moment. And it was just very strange. And I've always remembered that to this day, we still talk about how we heard that music and we never knew what it was. And we just simply walked out the door, went to the bar and didn't say nothing else about it and then came back, went to bed and went deer hunting in the morning. Thanks Derek. Great show.

I live in Washington State now, but this story takes place in Central Coast California and it takes place in the early 2000s when I was about 15 years old. I lived with my dad and his fiance at the time. They got engaged very quickly and I really disliked her and we lived in this pretty amazing house. We didn't live there for very long, but I started to experience strange things in that house. And the first one was I lived in this room in the back of the house and it had French doors out onto a back patio. And one time I was in the bathroom that was just outside of my bedroom. And when I left my bedroom, I know that the doors were closed. I almost never opened those French doors. And I was in the bathroom and my bedroom door was open and my dad came home with our two rambunctious dogs and they went running through the house and into my room and then they didn't come back out of my room and my dad came running after them and was sort of shouting at me for leaving my French doors open. And I said I didn't. And that happened a few times. And then one night I was reading in bed and I just got this sense that someone was standing next to my bed pretty close to me. Not like intimidatingly close to me, but fairly close. And I just felt this presence and I didn't see anything. I looked up, I didn't see a figure, but I just felt this presence. And I noted that I didn't feel scared. Like I knew someone was standing there looking at me, but I didn't feel scared. And I somehow also knew that it was a man and that he was in his mid-30s. It was very strange to just Know this. And sometime later, I was at dinner with my dad and his fiance and we heard a door close in the house. It could have been the wind, who knows? But it prompted my dad's fiance to say, welcome, join us. She was very eccentric. And she turned to me and she said, oh, did you know we have a ghost? And I almost never talked to her, but I couldn't help myself because I was really excited. And I said, yeah, I do know that. But I didn't want to say anything about it. I wanted to hear what she had to say to see if we had a similar impression of this ghost. And she was telling me she had spent a few nights on the couch downstairs because she had a cough and she didn't want to wake my dad up. And we had these battery powered electric candles, like cheesy fake candles on the mantle. And the way that you would turn them on, you had to pick them up. And there was a little toggle switch on the bottom. And she woke up coughing. And one of them was on. And then she went back to sleep. And the next time she woke up coughing, a different one was on. And she said that she didn't feel scared, she felt a presence, but she felt like it was comforting, which is similar to how I had felt. So then I asked, do you think it's a man or a woman? And she said almost immediately, it's a man. And I said, how old do you think he is? And she said, 35. I have tried to look into it just recently, actually. I did track down the son of the people who owned it at the time. The previous owners are no longer living. The son was very amused that I was looking into this, but he didn't know anything about it. I was just trying to find out if maybe a man in his mid-30s died in that house before we lived there. But I haven't been able to find that information. I even called county records office. And anyway, if anyone has any ideas about how to find this kind of information, you can track me down on the Internet. I'm a musician. I have a website, Zeo Bookbinder. Z E O B O E k b I n--e-r.com you can pretty easily find me and message me if you have thoughts on how to find out if somebody died in that house that I lived in. I know the address. Really enjoying your show.

The event that occurred to me actually did not occur in Texas. This occurred in Randolph, Massachusetts. And I was up there on November 4th. It's Thursday, actually the fifth that it happened because it was early in the morning. I went to bed on Wednesday and I was actually at a friend's house. I was in the spare bedroom and I actually was sleeping on a blow up bed. This was already the third, fourth day that I was sleeping in that room. As soon as you turn off the lights, it's complete darkness. There's no light coming in from the windows, there's no nightlight, it's just complete darkness. And the two windows that are there are actually right next to the bed and they are covered with a velvet black curtain. So it's complete darkness. So that night I went to bed and I don't know why, but I had this odd dream. I wouldn't really say it was a nightmare just because of the fact that, I mean, I would think a nightmare would be more monsters, I suppose. But this dream basically was me yelling at either my dog or a kid, telling them not to go next to this person on the opposite side of a pool that has been drained. Basically there was this old man laughing and it wasn't a very creepy like smile or anything, but it was just overall odd. I didn't like it. And I'm yelling and yelling and I'm thinking that maybe I woke myself up from that yelling somehow I just woke myself up. I am laying on my side. As soon as I open my eyes, I just automatically lift up my head. There is no need for it. I could have just opened my eyes and closed it, but instead I just open my eyes and just look straight at the corner of the room right next to me basically. And as I do so, I see a face. Now I'm staring at this face for a while because I'm thinking, okay, I'm just like seeing things. As I start looking down, I start realizing, oh my gosh, this person is wearing clothes. So as soon as I had that realization that there's a man in my room, I screamed and pulled the covers to my face and I started praying out loud. Now normally I would think I wouldn't be scared, but I don't know. I just started praying. As soon as I finished my prayer, I felt brave enough to grab my phone, turn on the flashlight and start scanning the room, nothing was there. Now this thing that I saw in the corner, his face, it looked like it was illuminated again. This room is complete darkness. And somehow I was able to see the details of his face as if there was kind of like a spotlight over his head. Well, anyways, I could see the face and I could see down and I could see that he's wearing kind of an older type shirt, kind of like a button down shirt with a kind of jacket or vest or something over it. So that's what really creeped me out. After I got up getting the room with my flashlight, I went running to wake up my friend. He checked their room to check the closets. I was like, there was somebody in my room. He's like, nobody's in here. Nobody can get in because his roommate is a cop. So there's no way anyone's gonna come in because they had like the whole house, like with cameras and everything. So I basically sat in my bed typing all of this out so I wouldn't forget. And I looked at the time and the time was 2:50 when I looked at it. So it happened sometime between 250 and 258. Well, thanks for letting me share this story.

The caller had an experience that I actually had as well when I was younger. Didn't happen here in Texas. It actually happened at my grandparents home in Massachusetts. I was about 6, 7 years old right before my family moved to Colorado which is why I was actually at my grandparents house cause they were watching.\n\n[Speaker C] Us while my parents were looking for a home. What happened was is I went to bed one night.\n\n[Speaker B] I knew it was dark.\n\n[Speaker C] At one point I was awake just.\n\n[Speaker B] Staring at the ceiling and it was like I blinked and it was morning. Like we're talking not like sun rising but bright like sun coming through the window. And all that thermosting in was upstairs.\n\n[Speaker C] Kind of on their second floor, almost.\n\n[Speaker B] A converted attic space. There was one window and I know the first question you're going to ask is was there three identical men? And I can tell you I don't know. I didn't get up to see because it was kind of one of those weird experiences, but wanted to share that.\n\n[Speaker C] With you because apparently I'm not the only one that experienced that.

This story, I was about 10 years old at the time when this happened, and I'm 32 now. So it's stuck with me all these years. And I think about it from time to time. But I had a few weird encounters as a kid in the house that I grew up in. And I often didn't tell my family about them just because, you know, I was either scared or I would also try to rationalize or play them off kind of in order to calm myself down. I'll never forget one story in particular. I was at home alone, which happened often. My mom was a single mom, and I had an older brother, but he was a teenager at the time, and so he was out a lot with his friends or working or whatever. And I was in my bedroom. I was kind of potsing around and redecorating the space, which I often did. I was very creative and artistic kid. Anyways, I was in my room, and out of the corner of my eye, I saw a white humanoid figure run incredibly fast, like, impossibly fast past my bedroom door. But enough at a pace where I was able to, like, out of the corner of my eye, make out, like, a very clearly humanoid figure, which, the way the house was set up, my bedroom and my brother's bedroom were all the way at the end of the hall. There couldn't have been more than, like, three feet of space before reaching the wall at the end of my hallway. So there would have just been nowhere for this figure to go. And it was running so fast, it would have just plowed through the wall. And I screamed out loud, and I was so frightened that I called my mom at work, and she stayed on the phone with me. She worked down the street, and I knew she'd be coming home soon. So she stayed on the phone with me until she pulled in the driveway, which was, I think, the only time I really needed her to do that. When I was young, I was very independent kid. I kind of had to be only having one parent in the house. So the experience stands out for that reason too, because I was so scared in that moment that I just sat on my bed facing my door for a good half hour while I was on the phone with her before she got home. And my mom was very rational and calm all the time, and she just focused on calming me down, which she was very good at. Anyway. So she gets home, I kind of calm down, and we go about the evening, But I was still a little shaken up by it. So the next day we find out from one of our neighbors that our elderly neighbor across the street, she was a very sweet older woman. She had passed away the day before. So the same day that I had seen the figure and she passed away in the home. And I remember being so freaked out by that because I immediately thought, oh, my God, I wonder if that was her. And I've often wondered if what I saw was her, like, crossing over to the other side or if I saw her spirit or something like that. I have a few stories from that house, things that I saw growing up, but that one definitely stands out a little bit more than the others. Anyway, I love the show, absolutely love it.

Wanted to share a story that happened to me about a year ago, roughly April, May of last year. It was first thing in the morning, 7:30, taking off, going to work. And I'm driving from Antwerp, Ohio to Fort Wayne, Indiana. And there's a stretch of highway called 24. And as I was driving up this highway, you go over this overpass. And as I was coming up on top of this overpass. I look off into the sky and it's a bright blue, beautiful, beautiful day out. And you can see for miles in the sky. It's very flat in this part of the country. And I'm looking off into the left and I see this silver ball in the sky. And I was, like, dumbfounded. I was like, what in the world is that thing? And I just looked at it, and then I looked back at the road, and then I looked back at it. I look back at the road and then this silver ball, like, almost turned to a point where, if you can imagine having someone shine like a watch light in your eyes, like using the sun and shining that light in your eyes. It's almost like that silver sphere, like, shined its light into my eyes. I remember just blinking and then looking back at the road and then looking back to find where it was. It had vanished. It was gone. I didn't see it take off. I didn't see it move. I don't know if it went up. I don't know if it went somewhere else or over my head or something, but I didn't see it at that point. But it was this big silver sphere in the sky. And I was obviously, you know, dumbfounded by that experience. I'd never seen anything like that. But then, you know, listening to the show, I've heard, you know, multiple silver spheres or even black spheres in the sky. So very interesting story. Felt the urge to share it. Appreciate the show.

I recently discovered your podcast and on episode 13, season 14, a lady that was talking about a doubleganger individual. And this story takes place when I was in high school. I grew up in Puerto Rico and I went out with my friends. We went out to the city. It was at night. And even though I was hanging out with my friends, I wasn't drinking that night. And I wasn't a drinker really. Usually I was the designated driver. And that night we passed some bars where people used to hang out. And a girl stopped me, and she stopped me, said, hey, how are you? Don't you remember me? I'm looking at her, completely clueless. I had no idea who she was. And she's looking at me like she really knows me. She's like, don't you remember me? We went to school together one summer, and she started saying, my whole life. Don't you remember? We used to. We were friends and remember you like this guy? And she starts telling me my whole history. I'm looking at her and I'm thinking, I absolutely have no idea who you are. And she looks at me and she says, you. You don't remember me? And I'm looking at her and say, are you sure you're not confusing me with somebody else? And she says my name, and she told me where I was from, and she knew intimate details about my life, and I still had no idea who this woman was. And I am not a person that forgets people. This has never happened to me before. It has never happened to me since. So of course I'm looking at her and I'm saying, you don't even look familiar to me. Are you sure it's me that you are talking about? And my friends that were hanging out with me at the moment, they're looking at me like, are you sure you don't remember her? I was like, I absolutely have no idea. Do you guys know her? And they're like, no, we don't know who she is. And she was so disappointed. She's looking at me, says, well, your hair is a little different, but I'm sure it's you. I mean, this is your name. This is where we went to school together. I was like, are you sure we went to school together? She's like, well, it was summer school, and I'm from a different school. I should have took summer school at your school. I was like, I did not take summer school that year. She told me the year. I was like, that is not me. She's like, no, no, it is you. And this went on back and forth for a good 20 minutes until I told her, listen, I need to keep going because I'm hanging out with these friends, but I am so sorry if it was me. I don't remember you. And she seemed so disappointed because apparently she says that we were close to the point that I knew supposedly details about her and I had no idea who she was, and we moved on. I mean, I went and hung out with my other friends. And as we're walking away from this girl that she looked completely confused and actually like I had embarrassed her. But she also Looked disappointed, like she had lost a friend some sort. And my friend said that was. Are you being mean? Do you not remember her or you're just deciding not to know her? And I was like, no, I really don't know who she is. I have no idea who this girl is. And it has bothered me through years. To this day, I don't know who she is. I have no idea what she was talking about. But she knew details about my life. She knew about my family. She knew about boys that I liked at the school. She knew things that only a friend would have known. And I didn't have that many friends. I wasn't a popular kid. I wasn't like, I had 20 friends and I forgot somebody's family. I had maybe two or three friends. I would have never forgotten one friend because I wasn't the popular kid. I was just a kid that was just like in the. In between. Not really a loner, but not really a popular one. So this has always bothered me. And I heard this episode that you said, and I always wondered if this was a person that. Well, maybe she thought it was me and been impersonating me. Because it has happened to me before where people have stopped me and said, hey, I saw you here, thought it was you, but then I noticed it wasn't really you. And I've gotten that a lot. I just wanted to share that story with you. I appreciate it.

This was probably 20 years ago. I was living in Burleson, Texas, and I had my horses sported out in Crowley, Texas, and I would travel twice a day to go see them and feed them and take care of them. It was often dark when I would come back at night. And I did see a lot of things in the sky because it was open and I was kind of paying attention to the sky. But on this one particular night, it was in the summer, I had my windows down. It was a warm night in late July, that was probably 10 o' clock at night driving down 1187 Crowley Road. And all of a sudden I see this white, perfectly round orb fall from the top of the sky to the tree line. I don't know A thousand feet in front of me at an incredible speed. And while I'm trying to process this, I'm at a four way stop and there's nobody except for one other person next to me that has pulled up to the stoplight. And when I'm processing this, all of a sudden these colors come up out of the forested area and they shoot straight up from the bottom of the tree line all the way to the top of the sky. And the only way I can describe it is if you took a glass of milk and you put food coloring in there, it would stay. And the colors would stay separate and would spin around and be these unusual designs. So there's no way at all that this was fireworks or anything like that. This was just huge swaths of color. And there were red and blue and green fuchsia. The biggest swaths of color were white. And these look like lightning strikes coming up from the forested area to the top of the sky. And it only lasted a few seconds. I looked over to the guy next to me and he rolled his window down and all I could think of was, oh, I hope he saw this, because I see things and no one ever sees them with me. And he said, I saw that too. I said, what is that? And he goes, I don't know. And we just kind of went on our way. A week, maybe a month later, I'm at my house in Burleson and my daughter's in college, so I live by myself. I have this house that was built in the early 90s. It has these windows that go from the floor to the ceiling just about. And in my bedroom there are two of those. And there's a courtyard right behind my bedroom with a locked door date. I have this big 90 pound American Bulldog. And he's very sweet, but he's also protective. So that's one way I would let him out. If he had to go to the bathroom at night, I would just open the window and let him out and he would scratch on the window and I'd let him back in. So I did that one night and I started to lay down and I hear a bark. That is. I've never heard him bark like this. It was apparent when I heard it. It's an intruder. You need to get out of here. I'm getting ready to open the window and look out, fully expecting to see a person in the yard that he's got cornered back there, but there isn't. He is barking up at a white orb that is perfectly round and perfectly the most incredibly Beautiful white thing I have ever seen. I couldn't see through it, but it glowed from within. And if you took my Toyota Corolla that I have and rounded it into a perfect ball, that would be about the size of this thing. It couldn't have been any higher than 10ft off the ground. I don't know if people will think I'm crazy or not, but it happened. So I don't know what else to say. And I actually have never told anybody this except my sister. So this glowing white orb has, coming out of the side of it, maybe a little bit wider than the width of an arm, a beam of light that doesn't come out of a portal or anything. It just comes out of the side of it, and it's shining directly at Buddy. The beam stops about probably 2ft away from him. And the light is white and clear, but it has, like, particles in it. It's hard to explain. But anyway, I could see this. I call it a skin on the outside of this thing because it was like if a craft could be alive. I knew immediately when I saw it that it was alive. It was into craft. It was a living thing. And I could see how the outside skin layer, or whatever it was, was made. It was just so pure white. And so Buddy's barking at this thing, and it was like, I knew immediately. And I don't know if it was telling me this or I just knew it, but I knew it didn't want Buddy. It wasn't trying to hurt him. It just wanted me to come out and look at me. And I was looking at it, and I was hanging out halfway out the window, and I yelled, buddy. And he turned around and looked at me with this look, like, oh, thank God. And he ran as fast as he could into the house, and we slammed the window down, and Buddy jumped on the bed, and I jumped under the covers. All I could think of was, I know this isn't really a safe place, but I just want to get under the covers, close my eyes, and I don't care if it comes after me. I just want to be asleep when it does. I don't want to know. And I could feel Buddy jumping off the bed and running toward the front of the house. So at the time in my mind, I was thinking, well, it's crossing over the house and he's following it. That's kind of what I was thinking. And I don't remember what happened after that. I do remember it the next morning, but I don't remember anything else that happened. After Buddy got off the bed. Anyway, that's my story. Thank you so much for having this podcast and for allowing people like me a way to tell our stories so others can hear it.

And this story takes place in Coshocton County, Ohio, close to New Bedford. Actually. My family owns property down there. I'm 43. My whole life, I've been going down there till about 2011. Little disagreement happened and I haven't been there since except for a couple Times, but that's where I used to deer hunt and spend a lot of times in the woods as a kid. My friend, me and him from high school, we still hunt together. And it's a December night. If anyone hunts, knows gun season after Thanksgiving. And this particular winter, maybe.09 or 10. I don't really remember the way the family's property is set up on some acreage. There was a house and barn built in the late 1800s and they were owned by Amish. And then my grandfather bought it in 1962, I believe. And then there was a new addition put on in 81. And as it was, me and my friend were sitting in the basement. Simple ceramic stone foundation basement. We had free gas, so the gas was always on. It was always warm in there. You know, it was a lower level. You could walk right in the downstairs. And as it got darker there, no water, no electricity. It would just get dark. And it was snowing very hard. And, you know, me and him were always big on going out to deer hunt and no issues there. And we decided that day we weren't going to do it. We were going to have our beers downstairs before we went to get something to eat. We were just downstairs and I remember thinking in my head, I'm hearing this music coming from upstairs. It's like the 1920s music. I don't know how to describe it. Just that. Not really a twang, just that 1920s kind of music. And I'm hearing this upstairs and I don't say anything to him. I just think it's our radio upstairs. We always had a radio that would run off batteries and we would turn it on. You get some of the local stations and we go to leave and you know, it's pitch black. We got our flashlights as we're going upstairs. I said, dude, you leave the radio on? And he says, no, I didn't leave the radio on. I said, you didn't leave the radio on? He's like, no. I was like, I've been hearing this music, this old music, like as long as we've been down here just hanging out. And he's like, I didn't leave the radio on. And we both go upstairs and I walk right over to the radio and the radio is completely off. And I look at him. I was like, I was really hearing some strange music, like old music. And he looks at me, goes, I heard the same thing. But neither one of us had said anything about it, like to each other until that moment. And it was just very strange. And I'VE always remembered that to this day we still talk about how we heard that music and we never knew what it was and we just simply walked out the door, went to the bar and didn't say nothing else about it and then came back, went to bed and went deer hunting in the morning. Thanks Derek. Great show.

I live in Washington State state now, but this story takes place in Central Coast California and it takes place in the early 2000s when I was about 15 years old. I lived with my dad and his fiance at the time. They got engaged very quickly and I really disliked her and we lived in this pretty amazing house. We didn't live there for very long, but I started to experience strange things in that house. And the first one was I lived in this room in the back of the house and it had French doors out onto a back patio. And one time I was in the bathroom that was just outside of my bedroom. And when I left my bedroom I know that the doors were closed. I almost never opened those French doors and I was in the bathroom and my bedroom door was open and my dad came home with our two rambunctious dogs and they went running through the house and into my room and then they didn't come back out of my room and my dad came running after them and was sort of shouting at me for leaving my French doors open. And I said I didn't. And that happened a few times. And then one night I was reading in bed and I just got this sense that someone was standing next to my bed pretty close to me. Not like intimidatingly close to me, but fairly close. And I just felt this presence and I didn't see anything. I looked up, I didn't see a figure, but I just felt this presence and I noted that I didn't feel scared. Like I knew someone was standing there looking at Me, but I didn't feel scared. And I somehow also knew that it was a man and that he was in his mid-30s. It was very strange to just know this. And sometime later I was at dinner with my dad and his fiance and we heard a door close in the house. It could have been the wind, who knows? But it prompted my dad's fiance to say, welcome, join us. She was very eccentric. And she turned to me and she said, oh, did you know we have a ghost? And I almost never talked to her, but I couldn't help myself because I was really excited. And I said, yeah, I do know that. But I didn't want to say anything about it. I wanted to hear what she had to say to see if we had a similar impression of this ghost. And she was telling me she had spent a few nights on the couch downstairs because she had a cough and she didn't want to wake my dad up. And. And we had these battery powered electric candles, like cheesy fake candles on the mantle. And the way that you would turn them on, you had to pick them up. And there was a little toggle switch on the bottom. And she woke up coughing. And one of them was on. And then she went back to sleep. And the next time she woke up coughing, a different one was on. And she said that she didn't feel scared, she felt a presence, but she felt like it was comforting, which is similar to how I had felt. So then I asked, do you think it's a man or a woman? And she said almost immediately, it's a man. And I said, how old do you think he is? And she said, 35. I have tried to look into it just recently, actually. I did track down the son of the people who owned it at the time. The previous owners are no longer living. The son was very amused that I was looking into this, but he didn't know anything about it. I was just trying to find out if maybe a man in his mid-30s died in that house before we lived there. But I haven't been able to find that information. I even called county records office. And anyway, if anyone has any ideas about how to find this kind of information, you can track me down on the Internet. I'm a musician. I have a website, Zeo Bookbinder. Z E O B O E k b I N-E-R.com you can pretty easily find me and message me if you have thoughts on how to find out if somebody died in that house that I lived in. I know the address. Really enjoying your show.

The event that occurred to me actually did not occur in Texas. This occurred in Randolph, Massachusetts. And I was up there on November 4th. It's Thursday, actually the fifth that it happened because it was early in the morning. I went to bed on Wednesday and I was actually at a friend's house. I was in the spare bedroom and I actually was sleeping on a blow up bed. This was already the third, fourth day that I was sleeping in that room. As soon as you turn off the lights, it's complete darkness. There's no light coming in from the windows, there's no nightlight. It's just complete darkness. And the two windows that are there are actually right next to the bed and they are covered with a velvet black curtain. So it's complete darkness. So that night I went to bed and I don't know why, but I had this odd. I wouldn't really say it was a nightmare just because of the fact that, I mean, I would think a nightmare would be more monsters, I suppose. But this dream basically was me yelling at either my dog or a kid, telling them not to go next to this person on the opposite side of a pool that has been drained. Basically there was this old man laughing and it wasn't a very creepy like smile or anything, but it was just overall odd. I didn't like it. And I'm yelling and yelling and I'm thinking that maybe I woke myself up from that yelling. Somehow I just woke myself up. I am laying on my side. As soon as I open my eyes, I just automatically lift up my head. There is no need for it. I could have just opened my eyes and closed it, but instead I just opened my eyes and just look straight at the corner of the room right next to me basically. And as I do so I see a face. Now I'm staring at this face for a while because I'm thinking, okay, I'm just like seeing things. As I start looking down, I start realizing, oh my gosh, this person is wearing clothes. So as soon as I had that realization that there's a man in my room, I screamed and you know, pulled the covers to my face and I started praying out loud. Now, normally I would think I wouldn't be scared, but I don't know. I just started praying. As soon as I finished my prayer, I felt brave enough to grab my phone, turn on the flashlight, scanning the room. Nothing was there. Now, this thing that I saw in the corner, his face, it looked like it was illuminated again. This room is complete darkness. And somehow I was able to see the details of his face as if there was kind of like a spotlight over his head. Well, anyways, I could see the face and I could see down and I could see that he's wearing kind of an older type shirt, kind of like a button down shirt with a kind of jacket or vest or something over it. So that's what really creeped me out. After I got up, standing in the room with my flashlight, I went running to wake up my friend. He checked their room to check the closet because I was like, there was somebody in my room. He's like, nobody's in here. Nobody can get in because his roommate is a cop. So there's no way anyone's gonna come in because they have like the whole house, like with cameras and everything. So I basically sat in my bed typing all this out so I wouldn't forget. And I looked at the time and the time was 2:58 when I looked at it. So it happened sometime between 250 and 258. Well, thanks for letting me share this story.

When I was younger, probably early 20s, I was working at a big box like home improvement store and I would work there till late at night a lot of the time I would have early morning shifts the next day. So because of that I had an aunt who lived nearby a couple blocks away. She lived in an apartment building with my cousin and my cousin would walk to the home improvement store and would meet the after work. It wasn't the greatest neighborhood so he would meet me there and I'd go to my aunt's place and stay the night and go to work early in the morning. So this was just like any other night. He came and met me. It was probably between 11:30 and midnight after everything was closed up. So we had a couple blocks and we get on this main road and it was kind of quiet, chillier night. I think it was early spring so maybe one or two people before we got to the main street that the apartment building was on. There weren't any cars on the street at the time. It was quiet. Me and my cousin were just talking to each other. I was close to the curb and my cousin was on the left side. There were no cars in the street and all the houses that we were going by, our apartment buildings, there was a long walkway that led up to each building. There weren't any trees or anything around this area specifically. So there was a person. It was a man. He was walking towards us probably 50ft. I didn't see where he came from. He was kind of just there. I believe he was African American and he had full camo fatigues on the standard like green and brown and those colors pants. He had a jacket on and he had a hat, and he was staring at me. And my cousin was talking, but I couldn't focus. This man was just staring at me. Walking closer to us. We get maybe 10, 15ft apart, and he starts to, you know, go beside my cousin on the inside of the sidewalk. I'm close to the curb because it's next to me. The man goes around my cousin to, you know, keep going down the sidewalk. As he does, he's still looking at me. And he says, what the are you looking at? And he just keeps walking past. I just kept walking. My cousin didn't say anything the whole time. He just kind of still going on talking. We get maybe 5, 10ft past, and I go, man, what was his problem? And my cousin says, who? Who are you talking about? And I turn around to point to the guy, and there's nobody there. Again, there are no cars on the street. You know, he couldn't have ran up into any houses or no bushes or anything around. It was very empty street. My cousin had the guy literally walk directly past him. He didn't see him. I have no idea about that. I think about it all the time.

The caller had a experience that I actually had as well when I was younger.\n\n[Speaker B] Didn't happen here in Texas, actually happened at my grandparents home in Massachusetts.\n\n[Speaker A] I was about 6, 7 years old right before my family moved to Colorado.\n\n[Speaker B] Which is why I was actually at.\n\n[Speaker A] My grandparents house cause they were watching us while my parents were looking for a home.\n\n[Speaker B] What happened was, is I went to bed one night.\n\n[Speaker A] I knew it was dark.\n\n[Speaker B] At one point I was awake just.\n\n[Speaker A] Staring at the ceiling and it was like I blinked and it was morning. Like we're talking not like sun rising, but bright like sun coming through the window. And all that thermosting in was upstairs.\n\n[Speaker B] Kind of on their second floor, almost a converted attic space. There was one window and I know.\n\n[Speaker A] The first question you're going to ask is was there three identical men? And I can tell you, I don't know. I didn't get up to see because it was kind of one of those weird experiences, but wanted to share that.\n\n[Speaker B] With you because apparently I'm not the only one that experienced

Wanted to share a story that happened to me about a year ago, roughly April, May of last year. It was first thing in the morning, 7:30, taking off, going to work, and I'm driving from Antwerp, Ohio to Fort Wayne, Indiana, and there's a stretch of highway called 24. And as I was driving up this highway, you go over this overpass. And as I was coming up on top of this overpass, I look off into the sky and it's a bright blue, beautiful, beautiful day out. And you can see for miles in the sky. It's very flat in this part of the country. And I'm looking off into the left and I see this silver ball in the sky. And I was like, dumbfounded. I was like, what in the world is that thing? And I just looked at it and then I looked back at the road and then I looked back at it. I look back at the the road and then this silver ball, like, almost turned to a point where, if you can imagine having someone shine like a watch light in your eyes, like using the sun and shining that light in your eyes. It's almost like that silver sphere, like, shined its light into my eyes. I remember just blinking and then looking back at the road and then looking back to find where it was. It had vanished. It was gone. I didn't see it take off. I didn't see it move. I don't know if it went up. I don't know if it went somewhere else or over my head or something, but I didn't see it at that point. But it was this big silver sphere in the sky. And I was obviously, you know, dumbfounded by that experience. I'd never seen anything like that. But then, you know, listening to the show, I've heard, you know, multiple silver spheres or even black spheres in the sky. So very interesting story. Felt the urge to share it. Appreciate the show.

I recently discovered your podcast and on episode 13, season 14, a lady that was talking about a doubleganger individual. And this story takes place when I was in high school. I grew up in Puerto Rico and I went out with my friends. We went out to the city. It was at night and even though I was hanging out with my friends, I wasn't drinking that night and I wasn't a drinker really. Usually I was the Designated driver. And that night, we passed some bars where people used to hang out, and a girl stopped me, and she stopped me, said, hey, how are you? Don't you remember me? And I'm looking at her, completely clueless. I had no idea who she was. And she's looking at me like she really knows me. She's like, don't you remember me? We went to school together one summer, and she started saying, my whole life. Don't you remember we were friends and remember you like this guy? And she starts telling me my whole history. I'm looking at her and I'm thinking, I absolutely have no idea who you are. And she looks at me and she says, you don't remember me? And I'm looking at her and say, are you sure you're not confusing me with somebody else? And she says, my name is. And she told me where I was from, and she knew intimate details about my life. And I still had no idea who this woman was. And I am not a person that forgets people. This has never happened to me before. It has never happened to me since. So of course I'm looking at her and I'm saying, you don't even look familiar to me. Are you sure it's me that you are talking about? And my friends that were hanging out with me at the moment, they're looking at me like, are you sure you don't remember her? I was absolutely have no idea. Do you guys know her? And they're like, no, we don't know who she is. And she was so disappointed. She's looking at me, says, well, your hair is a little different, but I'm sure it's you. I mean, this is your name. This is where we went to school together. I was like, are you sure we went to school together? She's like, well, it was summer school, and I'm from a different school. I should have took summer school at your school. Like, I did not take summer school that year. She told me the year. I was like, that is not me. She's like, no, no, it is you. And this went on back and forth for a good 20 minutes until I told her, listen, I need to keep going because I'm hanging out with these friends, but I am so sorry if it was me. I don't remember you. And she seemed so disappointed because apparently she says that we were close to the point that I knew supposedly details about her, and I had no idea who she was, and we moved on. I mean, I went and hung out with my other friends, and as we're walking away from this girl that she looked completely confused and actually like I had embarrassed her. But she also looked disappointed, like she had lost a friend some sort. And my friend said that was. Are you being mean? Do you not remember her or you're just deciding not to know her? And I was like, no, I really don't know who she is. I have no idea who this girl is and has bothered me through years. To this day, I don't know who she is. I have no idea what she was talking about. But she knew details about my life. She knew about my family. She knew about boys that I liked at the school. She knew things that only a friend would have known. And I didn't have that many friends. I wasn't a popular kid. I wasn't like, I had 20 friends and I forgot somebody's name. I had maybe two or three friends. I would have never forgotten one friend because I wasn't the popular kid. I was just a kid that was just like in the. In between. Not really a loner, but not really a popular one. So this has always bothered me. And I heard this episode that you said, and I always wondered if this was a person that. Well, maybe she thought it was me and been impersonating me. Because it has happened to me before where people have stopped me and said, hey, I saw you here. I thought it was you, but then I noticed it wasn't really you. And I've gotten that a lot. I just wanted to share that story with you. I appreciate it.

This story, I was about 10 years old at the time when this happened, and I'm 32 now. So it's stuck with me all these years, and I think about it from time to time. But I had a few weird encounters as a kid in the house that I grew up in. And I often didn't tell my family about them just because, you know, I was either scared or I would also try to rationalize or play them off kind of in order to calm myself down. I'll never forget one story in particular. I was at home alone, which happened often. My mom was a single mom, and I had an older brother, but he was a teenager at the time, and so he was out a lot with his friends or working or whatever. And I was in my bedroom. I was kind of potsing around and redecorating the space, which I often did. I was very creative and artistic kid. Anyways, I was in my room, and out of the corner of my eye, I saw a white humanoid figure run incredibly fast, like, impossibly fast past my bedroom door. But enough at a pace where I was able to, like, out of the corner of my eye, make out like a very clearly humanoid figure, which, the way the house was set up, my bedroom and my brother's bedroom were all the way at the end of the hall. There couldn't have been more than, like, three feet of space before reaching the wall at the end of my hallway. So there would have just been nowhere for this figure to go. And it was running so fast, it would have just plowed through the wall. And I screamed out loud. And I was so frightened that I called my mom at work, and she stayed on the phone with me. She worked down the street, and I knew she'd be coming home soon, so she stayed on the phone with me until she pulled in the driveway, which was, I think, the only time I really needed her to do that. When I was young, I was a very independent kid. I kind of had to be only having one parent in the house. So the experience stands out for that reason too, because I was so scared in that moment that I just sat on my bed facing my door for a good half hour while I was on the phone with her before she got home. And my mom was very rational and calm all the time, and she just focused on calming me down, which she was very good at. Anyway, so she gets home, I kind of calm down, and we go about the evening, but I was still a little shaken up by it. So the next day we find out from one of our neighbors that our elderly neighbor across the street, she was a very sweet older woman. She had passed away the day before. So the same day that I had seen the figure and she passed away in the home. And I remember being so freaked out by that because I immediately thought, oh, my God, I wonder if that was her. And I've often wondered if what I saw was her, like crossing over to the other side or if I saw her spirit or something like that. I have a few stories from that house, things that I saw growing up, but that one definitely stands out a little bit more than the others. Anyway, I love the show, absolutely love it. I've been listening to it non stop, so keep it up.

This was probably 20 years ago. I was living in Burleson, Texas, and I had my horses sported out in Crowley, Texas, and I would travel twice a day to go see them and feed them and take care of them. It was often dark when I would come back at night, and I did see a lot of things in the sky because it was open and I was kind of paying attention to the sky. But on this one particular night, it was in the summer, I had my windows down. It was a warm night in Late July, it was probably 10 o' clock at night driving down 1187 Crowley Road. And all of a sudden I see this white, perfectly round orb fall from the top of the sky to the tree line, I don't know, a thousand feet in front of me at an incredible speed. And while I'm trying to process this, I'm at a four way stop and there's nobody except for one other person next to me that have pulled up to the stoplight. And when I'm processing this, all of a sudden these colors come up out of the forested area and they shoot straight up from the bottom of the tree line all the way to the top of the sky. And the only way I can describe it is if you took a glass of milk and you put food coloring in there, it would stay. And the colors would stay separate and would spin around and be these unusual designs. So there's no way at all that this was fireworks or anything like that. This was just huge swaths of color. And there were red and blue and green fuchsia. The biggest swaths of color were white. And these look like lightning strikes coming up from the forested area to the top of the sky. And it only lasted a few seconds. I looked over to the guy next to me and he rolled his window down and all I could think of was, oh, I hope he saw this, because I see things and no one ever sees them with me. And he said, I saw that too. I said, what is that? And he goes, I don't know. And we just kind of went on our way. A week, maybe a month later, I'm at my house in Burleson and my daughter's in college, so I live by myself. I have this house that was built in the early 90s. It has these windows that go from the floor to the ceiling just about. And in my bedroom there are two of those. And there's a courtyard right behind my bedroom with a locked door. I have this big 90 pound American Bulldog. And he's very sweet, but he's also protective. So that's one way I would let him out. If he had to go to the bathroom at night, I would just open the window and let him out and he would scratch on the window and let him back in. So I did that one night and I started to lay down and I hear a bark that is. I've never heard him bark like this. It was apparent when I heard it. It's an intruder. You need to get out of here. I'm getting ready to open the window. And look out, fully expecting to see a person in the yard that he's got cornered back there, but there isn't. He is barking up at a white orb. It is perfectly round and perfectly the most incredibly beautiful white thing I have ever seen. I couldn't see through it, but it glowed from within. And if you took my Toyota Corolla that I have and rounded it into a perfect ball, that would be about the size of this thing. It couldn't have been any higher than 10ft off the ground. I don't know if people will think I'm crazy or not, but it happened. So I don't know what else to say. And I actually have never told anybody this except my sister. So this glowing white orb has, coming out of the side of it, maybe a little bit wider than the width of an arm, a beam of light that doesn't come out of a portal or anything. It just comes out of the side of it, and it's shining directly at Buddy. The beam stops about probably 2ft away from him. And the light is white and clear, but it has, like, particles in it. It's hard to explain. But anyway, I could see this. I call it a skin on the outside of this thing because it was like if a craft could be alive. I knew immediately when I saw it that it was alive. It wasn't a craft. It was a living thing. And I could see how the outside skin layer, or whatever it was, was made. It was just so pure white. And so Buddy's barking at this thing, and it was like, I knew immediately. And I don't know if it was telling me this or I just knew it, but I knew it didn't want Buddy. It wasn't trying to hurt him. It just wanted me to come out and look at me. And I was looking at it, and I was hanging out halfway out the window, and I yelled, buddy. And he turned around and looked at me with this look, like, oh, thank God. And he ran as fast as he could into the house. And we slammed the window down, and Buddy jumped on the bed, and I jumped under the covers. All I could think of was, I know this isn't really a safe place, but I just want to get under the covers, close my eyes, and I don't care if it comes after me. I just want to be asleep when it does. I don't want to know. And I could feel Buddy jumping off the bed and running toward the front of the house. So at the time in my mind, I was thinking, well, it's crossing over the house and he's following it. That's kind of what I was thinking. And I don't remember what happened after that. I do remember it the next morning, but I don't remember anything else that happened after Buddy got off the bed. Anyway, that's my story. Thank you so much for having this podcast and for allowing people like me a way to tell our stories so others can hear it.

Just giving you a call. Listening to the Christmas episode and the haunted toys that they were talking about, it kind of brought back a memory. So whenever I was six or seven, I was sleeping in bed at the time. And there was a doll that was given to me at birth. It was a little clown doll. Of course, it has to always be clown. But I was laying in bed and looking up at the shelving where this doll was. And I had never moved this doll. It was always there. I don't think I ever even touched it. But I was about 6 or 7, it was at nighttime, everybody was asleep. And I could have swore to anybody that while I was looking at this doll, it turned its head towards me and it kind of looked at me. Of course, at that time, a six or seven, that scared the bejesus out of me. So I put my head under the covers, trying to contemplate what to do, and opened up the covers. It was still staring at me. So I quickly got out of bed and at 6 or 7, I knew kind of where my mom kept the scissors. She did a lot of sewing at that time. So I went and got the scissors and kind of did describe this doll. It was a very, very simple type of doll. It had the strings that were kind of the skeleton, if you will. So it had strings running through it that attached the head to the feet and the hands. And in between all of that were round discs of fabric that the string went through, so they look like it was ruffled. So I grabbed the scissors and I came back to the room, turned the lights on, I got something to stand on, grabbed the doll and I cut the string. So the doll fell apart. Well, I threw it away and didn't think twice of it. My mom was very upset with me when she found that out, actually. But anyway, a couple days after that, I was again laying in bed at night. And my closet was one of those sliding door closets with the big mirrors on them that they used to have in the 80s. And kind of your reference, the doll was on a shelf kind of right by that sliding door. So it was kind of right in the same vicinity. Well, that sliding door started open. It opened about 2 inches while I was sitting there watching it and that scared me. Then you went out the room and then not too long after that I was in my parents room just watching TV or something. I forget. But all of a sudden there were a bunch of knocks, just a series of knocks all the way down the wall and that scared me at that time. So long story short, I think that once I cut that doll string kind of made it fall apart. Either I released something or something wasn't happy with me and it just kind of stuck with me until we moved out of that house whenever I was 10 years old.

But this story is originally coming from my childhood bedroom in Long Island. I just listened to your Christmas podcast and someone told a story about a Furby. I wanted to call and tell you my Furby story. So when I was in middle school, Furbies were really popular. I think Furbies were probably at their peak maybe in the early 2000s. So that would put me somewhere like around sixth grade, let's say. And I really wanted a Furby. Everybody wanted a Furby. I used to call the radio station C100 to try to be the 100th caller to win a Furby. And, you know, I was one of those kids that forever said my Furby was on its way until I, like, actually got it. So I tell you all this to let you know I was really, really excited when I got my Furby finally. And my Furby was a black and white Furby. And I told this Furby a joke. I said, what's black and white and really stupid? And the Furby's eyes got really low and so did its ears. And I felt like in this moment, it was looking right at me. And it said people like that. It said, people, I very clearly remember this. And the reason I don't think my child's mind made this up was I, like, never played with that Furby again. I threw the Furby across the room, and this toy that I'd wanted so long, like, really impacted me in a real way. And so when I heard the last story about a Furby, I thought to myself, wow, this is way too many coincidence around these Furbies. The Furby also did used to, like, kind of turn itself on and, like, make noises and. Yeah, I don't know, maybe it was a programming glitch or, I don't know, maybe it's the wavelength that could be tapped into by multi dimensional beings. Furby Explorer Channel. I don't know.

I just have a quick kind of light hearted story. Back in the summer of 2015, I lived with my grandparents and my grandma had passed away that summer kind of suddenly and it was like very traumatic for me and my family but I still lived with my grandpa. And this event happened. It couldn't have been more than a month after my grandma passed away. I believe it was a few weeks after. And I was in the kitchen and I was looking for a specific utensil. I can't recall exactly what utensil it was, but I was looking for some utensil that I couldn't find. And I swear I tore that kitchen apart just nearly. I looked everywhere and my grandma was a pretty prolific baker and she loved to cook and stuff. And I was like stressed out, just kind of like where is this? And I just kind of stopped for a moment and I just thought of my grandma was like, I really wish my grandma was here for many reasons, but I really wish she was here because I have no idea where this utensil is. And right after, you know, I kind of thought that I heard her voice in my head and it wasn't my voice. Like the little voice that most people have in their heads where they have a conversation like mine's very talkative. It wasn't that voice, it was in my grandmother's voice. And she said check the dishwasher. And I had already checked the dishwasher. Like that was one of the first places I had looked. But I just after hearing her in my head, I was like, okay. And I go and I check the dishwasher, and it was right there in the dishwasher. We've been listening to your show every day, and you mentioned the story your dad had about hearing a voice telling him not to put bleach on his jeans. It was going to ruin his jeans. And it just kind of jogged this memory for me. I don't know exactly if it was my grandma's spirit, you know, coming back to help me or whatnot, but it was definitely weird because I had checked the dishwasher washer.

And it always seemed like it happened between Thanksgiving holidays and Christmas holidays. It was like when everybody was all festive and happy and everything. And I would have this dream. At first I thought it was a dream. I'll tell you about the first visitation because after that things changed. Because of things that I had to do to protect myself. The first time I was sleep and I could hear these little jingle bells, little twinkling bells, like running through the house, you know, like running from one room to the next to a corner to the next. And I was sleeping. It kind of woke me up, but I just laid there and kept my eyes closed because I didn't know what was. Was going on. Kind of scared me. And I seen this little man. I guess he was not quite 2ft tall, probably was smaller than that, this little elf. But I had seen him darting across the room and everything. And he was really fast. He would think about him being fast like if it was a mouse running, you know, he was just that fast. But he had real big feet and they curled up at the toes. He actually had bells on his toes because the shoes were curled up. And he was kind of dressed in green and some black, like a black cape, like hoodie. And he was just ugly, like little short clawed like hands. He was like blackish skin, dark skin. I think he had like a dirty beard. It kind of reminds you of like a bat face. When he opened his mouth, he had all these pointed teeth and everything. His eyes were like bloodshot red and he had a hood on with like a little cape. But I just, you know, was chilling and everything laying there, but I was scared. So finally he was creeping to the bed because me and my sister, we always slept in the same room, but we had our own beds. So I looked at him walk all around her twin bed and peep over her covers and look in her face and all this kind of stuff. So then I was getting scared. So finally he came to me and I was scared and finally I just opened my eyes and looked at him. And when I did that, he just hollered and screeched and. And all just scared me to death the way he was hollering and screeching and flaring and flaring his arms and everything. And I can remember screaming and hollering and crying and he ran and I ran to my parents bed and that's where I Said. I said, this little man. This little man. And they were saying, oh, you were just having a nightmare. So after that, I never thought no more about it until next year around the holidays. Like I said, between Thanksgiving and Christmas, sometimes I would be lucky and wouldn't see him for Thanksgiving. And he would come, like two days before Christmas or whatever. But then it had got to the point where I used to sleep with the covers over my head and tie really tight ball that when I started feeling like this was the time of the year, till I would be sweating so bad in the bed because I would be so paranoid. And then I would hear the bells ringling, chingling, running through the house. You know, kind of reminds you of like if you put bells on a cat or something. But he got slick when I would cover my head up. I knew when he was sniffing around my sister because I could hear him breathing, huffing and whatever. And he would come over to my bed and do the same thing. But he was slick. He would pull the covers off of my head, even though I would be holding it for dear life. He would just pull the covers out and then he would just smell all around. I could feel his breath on my face, and he'd be sniffing around my eyeballs and in my ears and my mouth. And I could feel his hot, stinky breath, breath on my face or whatever. But I just kept telling myself, don't open your eyes. Don't open your eyes. And he just kept doing that. After a while, eventually he would just stop. Because I could feel him finally get off of my bed. He was so sure he would have to crawl up on the bed to get to me. And he would get off of the bed and then finally go away. And I just stayed there like that all night and finally drift off. I had that little elf visitor four or five times in my life. I think what really, finally made him stop going away, because I had told myself, I guess I might have been about 12 or 13, I was getting pretty big to be afraid of seeing this thing. And I just told myself that, you know, if he comes, it's going to be a fight. I'm not going to hide anymore. I'm tired of it. But I still would cover my head up. But after I had that mindset that, you know it was going to be a match right then and there, I was going to put up with it. I never had the dreams anymore, or the visitation. I wouldn't say dreams. I'm 69 years old and I still can feel the hot breath and Just the idea of this thing sneaking in, pulling the covers off of me all in my face. But I just said, you know, we gonna do it the way they do it in the streets, you know, if he comes at me again.

This is the second time I'm calling in. So my husband and I, we started dating when we were both in high school. And this took place then around like 2006. And I was hanging out his house and he was going to drive me home, but I couldn't find my phone. So we got in the car, we were about to leave and I realized that I didn't have it. So we went back in to look for it. Took about like a minute. We found it pretty soon after going in, but it delayed us like about a minute or two. And we grew up in Kings Park, Long island, and there's a abandoned psychiatric center there. And it's very creepy. And growing up, we used to explore the ground and it's actually a park now there. Anyway, to get to my house from his house, we used to have to drive through that area, through the psych center grounds. And he was driving me home. And those roads are super dark, super windy, really creepy. And we round one of the bends there in the road and we encounter a overturned car. And we start pulling up and it just happened like probably 30 seconds before we came up upon it. We pull up, we obviously stop and we see a younger kid literally crawling out from the wreckage. And he runs up to the car and he's, you know, screaming for help. And he had two other friends in the car with him and they were getting out as well. And, you know, at this point we're both out of the car and I pull my phone out and as I'm pulling it out, I realized that I just missed the call. And it was an unknown number. And that area gets barely any reception, like barely. So I'm trying to call 911 and you know, finally I get through and we, you know, stay with the kids until the cops came. And then my husband, then boyfriend drives me home. And as we're pulling up to my house, I see that I had a voicemail and I listened to it and it's like super staticky and all I hear is a voice saying, not yet. And it kind of sounds like if you've ever seen the Mothman prop these, it kind of sounded like that voice that comes in on the phone and it was so scary. We listened to it several times and definitely said not yet. And the only thing we could think is if we had left when we were going to leave before going back for my phone, that overturned car was in our lane. We might have been in that lane and they might have crashed into us. And that's the only thing we could think is that we avoided something catastrophic. And my husband, he is petrified of the Mothman. Now he can't watch that movie, can't think about it, he won't talk about it because it scared us that much. And I tried to call back that number and it was non existent. So very creepy. It creeps us out to this day. So I thought I would share it with you guys. I love the podcast. Thank you so much.

I'm calling from a small town called Hundred, West Virginia. I grew up in this old farmhouse. And when I was a kid growing up, my sisters and I, we had this babysitter, we'll call her Mrs. Mercer. And she would tell my parents, like when they'd come home and they'd be parting ways with her. I remember a couple times she said that the house we grew up in was haunted and that her and her family had grew up there. So fast forward a couple years, around 1989, and it was Christmas Eve and my mother had told my sisters that if Santa Claus sees you, he'll take your presents and leave. And I got mad at my mom because I expected her to be lying to my sisters. So Christmas Eve in 1989, I woke up in the middle of the night. I had to use the bathroom really bad. I started down the stairs. And going down our staircase, on the left was a wall, but on the right there was no wall, so you could see the living room. And at the foot of the stairs was a door that led out to the porch. And our porch was all encased in it was the room itself. And that's where we kept our Christmas tree. And as I started down the steps, I see a man bend over at the tree. He's wearing red pants and a white shirt and he's big. I thought at first it was my father. And I stopped for a second and I was like, ah, dad might see me. And I thought, wait a second, dad doesn't own a red pair of pants. And just then as I looked to my right where there was no wall going down the staircase, you could see in our living room, I see a woman sitting in a rocking chair knitting with knitting needles. And she is dressed up for Christmas. And she looks like Mrs. Claude. She's wearing like a green outfit, a green hat, but it's got like some kind of design on it. It was kind of Christmassy. And I was getting ready to have my ninth birthday on New Year's Eve. So I was eight. I come running around the corner and I'm thinking, oh, my gosh, Santa Claus is real. And Mrs. Claus, she's real, too. And she rides a Santa on Christmas Eve. And for years, I did not know how to explain that. And I told people, carl's an adult. Hey, Santa Claus. I think he might be real because I seen him and his wife, Mrs. Claus. Until the year 2024, I was sitting in a jail, and I was sitting in jail with Mrs. Mercer's brother. One day, me and some other prisoners were talking about ghost stories. And we get locked down, and I'm with Mr. Mercer. And I asked him, I said, hey, you know that house that we all grew up in and you guys grew up in? I said, was it ever haunted? He had this old Southern twang to his voice. And he said, oh, yes. Oh, yes, that place was haunted, all right. I was haunted by my mom and dad. And I was like, your mom and dad? I never heard that story. Tell me about it. And he said, well, you know, so and so and so and so and so and so. We come from a small town. So everybody named I knew. They drove by and seen my mom sitting in her rocking chair knitting with knitting needles. And I was like, what? What did you just say? And here that night, I had seen his mom and dad celebrating Christmas as ghosts. The father was moving presents around, adjusting them, making them look nice under the tree, and the mother was knitting in a rocking chair.

So one day back in 1961, my brother and I were very, very young. We were at home with mom and dad and our pets, you know, our two dogs and our two cats. Well, anyway, we heard a strange noise coming from Brian's bedroom and we heard someone crying. And so Brian turned on the light, except that it wouldn't come on. And when dad used the flashlight, he saw there was a three foot elephant sitting on the shelf. And it was a very angry, bitter elf. It was just a young boy. And we said, what's wrong? And mom helped him down and put a blanket over him and gave him a bowl of chicken soup. And he was very, very nice and polite to us. He still wouldn't stop crying and he said, Santa fired me. And we all gasped and they said that can't be true. Santa would never do that. And he said, yeah he did. He said he fired him. He wasn't fast enough on the toy for Dutch and Live. And then he couldn't bake cookies because Mrs. Claus would get mad at him because he'd eat more cookies than he baked. So what are you going to do with a kid that's a spoiled brat? And his parents were shocked and disowned him. He ran away that night and came to our place. He somehow wound up at our place and he asked if he can stay here and we told him, yes, of course, we'd love to have you in the family. So he became happy. Dad bought him modern day clothes and he still remains as an invisible entity to this day. He will not leave. He resides in one of my toy halls and nobody can see him except me and Brian.

I'm sharing an experience I had in Florida in a small house. My landlord owned it years ago, and he ended up selling it, and he found it again years later, and it was on a different street from what he told me was there was a Native American medicine man, somebody said, that had bought the property, the land, and didn't want the house. So he had the house to move to another street. So that's when I moved in. And it was beautiful. It was all natural wood. It was like a mile from the beach. It was a really nice location. And I thought it was kind of weird because there were about seven doors that led to the outside. So no matter where you were in the house, you could basically go outside, which was great, but kind of weird, I guess. So I lived there for about two years, but about a year in, there were some weird things that started happening. It started with one afternoon, and I was just sitting on the couch, just closing my eyes, and I had this intrusive thought. It was like this vision, like it was this space, and it was super weird and kind of creepy. It took me by surprise. I jumped up and I walked to the bathroom around the corner. We had a big window in the bathroom, so I looked out the window. And there was opossum sitting there, staring back at me. And it was the same face that I saw when I was sitting there. So it was just this weird moment, and I'm like, hi. The possum just looked back at me like, hi. So that was weird. There started seeing some weird things happening. Like, at night, I would be sitting there, and it was like somebody was pulling my hair, like, yanking my hair. And that happened, like, two or three times. And I did hear footsteps. And there was another time I would have a candle lit in a room without any air blowing or anything. The fan wasn't on, and I would leave the room, come right back, and the candle would be blown out. That was a little weird, too. So I'm starting to get a little on edge. And basically the last thing that was the end for me was it was afternoon again. I was walking through my house and started to approach the kitchen, and there was another room off to the right. And as I'm approaching the kitchen and that room, I see three men. I guess I just assumed they were men. And they were right, maybe three feet from me, like, right there. And they were all facing each other with, like, their heads down and they had hoods on. And I basically just froze. It was really, really silent, really eerily silent. And you would have thought that they were talking or something. You would hear something because they're all facing each other. But there was no noise or anything. And I just froze, and I backed up, and I just. I don't remember anything else. I've tried to figure out what I did after that because usually that would be kind of memorable. Like, you know, what do I do in this situation?

And about 12 years ago I bought a house in Barrie, Ontario. And it was a really, really old house. And apparently it was like a farmhouse for an apple orchard. So I moved in and I lived by myself and just my dog. The first night I went to sleep, I was woken up about 3am to a screaming baby. I don't have children and there was no reason that there was a baby screaming in my house. So I went back to sleep. And the next day I walked around the house and I just told the house, I'm here. I'm not here to bother you or disturb you. Let's just live together. And I never told anybody about that because it felt pretty strange. And then I decided about four years later to sell the house. But as I was moving out, my best friend and my boyfriend were helping me move. And they both said, basically at the same time, thank God you're getting out of here, it's haunted. And I said, what are you talking about? And they both described the exact same thing, that there was like this little orb that would go in and out and around my couch and go into different places. And I obviously never saw that. But these two People, they didn't know each other at all until the day of moving because one was from another country. But they both had the exact same experience in my house. So I don't know if it was the baby. But I did ask my neighbor when I was moving that day to come over and have a drink. And he said, well, at one point there was a swimming pool in your backyard and a 15 year old boy was being bullied and being beaten up and thrown in the pool and ended up on life support and eventually died unfortunately. And then they cemented the whole backyard and the grass over the pool. But at the same time, that's not what I heard with the baby screaming. It was like a baby, baby screaming.

Even though I live in Alabama, this will be a story from when I lived in England. So it's been over 10 years now. I lived in England for three years to get my bachelor's degree. And while I lived there, I was on a student visa. So under a student visa, at least back then, you could work 20 hours per week while you were in school and you could work 40 hours while you were on breaks, like Christmas break, et cetera. And I had a job at a place called Office and it's a shoe store. And it was in York. I lived in York at the time. And it was the main floor three stories above it, and then a cellar basically below it with a door that I don't know how it was up to code. I mean, it was probably three feet tall to get into the cellar. And you know, it connected to the old, like aqueducts, that bar under York. I mean, York has so much history. It goes back to Romans and Vikings and all of this kind of stuff. So it's built on a ton of history. And I can remember no one ever wanted to go down to that cellar ever. But we kept like our wellies down there, like our rain boots, basically, things that were waterproof because it did get damp. It was not inflated. It was just a cellar in the streets of York. So I would always go down there just because I kind of liked being creeped out. And I never experienced anything down there. But I will say my one experience that I had in that store was on the second floor. Whenever we would go up to get shoes, we were constantly running up and down those stairs and on the second floor landing There was a comfy chair there, just one on the landing where people could sit and eat their lunch if they wanted to. And I was running up and my friend Claire was sitting on that chair. She had just taken a bite of her sandwich, which is very important. Her mouth was full. I could see that her mouth was full. And as I turn right to go into what we called the Converse Room, I went past the wall into the stockroom. And once I'm fully away from Claire, I hear her say something. I can't tell you what it was. I immediately just thought, oh, she said something. There's a wall between us now. So I just didn't hear her. I go in, I find the shoes that I need, I come back out and I'm like, hey, girl, what'd you say? Did you say something to me? And she was like, no, I was gonna ask you the same thing. Thing. And as she's saying this, she's like, her hand is over her mouth, she's still chewing and like she's eating. She could not have spoken as clearly as what I heard. Whatever it was speak. I can't tell you to this day what it said. I mean, it was so clear that it was just right in my ear, right like they were standing behind me. And she had the same experience. She thought it was just as close to her. We both thought each other had spoken. And, you know, that whole place was creepy. Even the very top floor, everyone would get like this feeling of vertigo. No one wanted to go up there alone. My shoes got thrown across the stock room once. I'm still not convinced whether or not that was a ghost or if it was someone playing a prank on me. Everyone says they did not play a prank on me, so they swear hand down. You know, I trust them to a certain extent, but, you know, all my friends that worked there had similar, just little one off experiences like that. But anyway, I just wanted to call in, keep it spooky. Thanks for all that.

When I heard this story from him, my friend and I had to like really get it out of him. He was like too disturbed or upset to even tell it. But he eventually told us, we're all in our mid-30s now. But when this happened to him, he was nine years old and his brother was 11 or 12. This took place somewhere in Manitoba. They lived on a property where their backyard like went out to the forest and they had been camping in their backyard one night and they had gotten woken up by like a light. I don't know if it was a sound in combination with the light, but they came out of their tent and they had seen like a glowing light hovering. They said it wasn't too far away, maybe like 10ft away. And it was like egg shaped and it was glowing and it was kind of hovering towards them slowly. And he said the next thing they knew they were up in the air like paralyzed, being pulled towards this light. And he said he remembers looking at his brother and they were looking at each other just like terrified, unable to do anything. And they're being pulled towards this light. And the next thing he remembers, he said that they were inside the light, they were laying down, but they still couldn't move and they were looking at each other. He says he doesn't know how to explain it any other way, but they were just inside of this light. Now when him and his brother woke up the next day. They were in their bed inside their house. And they had asked their parents if they brought them in in the middle of the night. And the parents said no. So they had no recollection of how they got back in the house. But he asked his brother if he remembers all of that happening last night. And he did remember. And they were just so freaked out they wouldn't talk about it again for years. Like decades. And when my friend had told us the story, it was just to me and one of my other friends when we were hanging out one night and my other friend started to kind of like laugh and make fun of my friend for this story. And he's like, you got to be making this up. And my friend that told the story got really, really upset and was like mad that he had even told the story. But I just wanted to tell that because it's pretty freaky. And I hope you enjoy.

I'm calling from Vancouver island in British Columbia, Canada. It was recently the anniversary of my dad's death, December 10th and it's put me in mind of a strange thing that happened shortly after he died and so I thought I would call and share that story with you. The town that my dad used to live in is a really small town in Northern Ontario. There's only about a thousand people in town and there's not a whole lot to do there, especially in wintertime. So needless to say, when someone dies in town, it's kind of a community event. He was a pretty young guy when he died. He was only 56. And the way that he died was he had a massive heart attack while he was driving through town. His car actually crossed into oncoming traffic and he crashed into a snowbank in front of the local arena. So yeah, it was kind of a thing the way that he died. It was just a really strange experience for me because I was away in university in Vancouver at the time. I hadn't been home for quite a number of years. My sister had just given birth to her daughter 10 days beforehand. So it was just this really strange, bizarre experience coming home to my dad's funeral. The viewing took place off and on for two days before the funeral. And I remember it had snowed like crazy on the second day. But luckily my brother in law Mike had plowed my dad's driveway so that we could get all of the vehicles up to my dad's place. My parents are divorced and so it fell on my sister and I to kind of do most of the sort of meeting and greeting on those viewing days, you know, so those were long days for us. But I remember getting back to my dad's place the night before the funeral and his house was just cold and dark when we showed up. The fire in the wood stove had obviously gone out early in the afternoon and we were all tired. I remember watching my sister take the baby out of her car seat in the dining room and hearing her ask my brother in law Mike, hey, did you leave the lights on in the tractor? My dad's old international tractor was parked behind the house to make room for all the cars we were expecting the next day. And I remember Mike saying, what? And she said, the lights are on on the tractor. And he didn't say anything. He just turned around and went back outside. I credit my brother in law Mike for freaking us all out entirely because he's this big, no nonsense guy from Calgary. He doesn't pull any punches, he doesn't take any crap from anybody. And when he came back into the house, he was white as a sheet and completely tongue tied. And we all just kind of looked at him for a beat and then he said, I know those lights were off yesterday when I finished plowing the driveway. There's no footprints around that tractor. And he just looked expectantly at Us each in turn. And I think it was my mom who was the first one to speak. She said, well, you know, maybe there's some moisture on the wiring or something. And Mike turned and looked at her and he said, the lights are physically turned on. And he made this kind of twisting gesture with his wrist. And my sister asked him again, are you sure you turned them off yesterday? And he said, yes, because I never turned them on in the first place. He's like, I plowed the driveway during the day. I didn't turn the lights on. Besides, the battery in that thing would have been dead hours ago. It's an old battery. And we all just looked at each other and I remember hearing Mike's voice say into that cold, dark house, I think that's Wayne, my dad, trying to let us know that he's here and that he's okay. So, yeah, that's my story from my dad's death day.

She's a nurse in her early 60s and sometimes she works in the night shift at a care facility with overnight patients. A little while ago, she experienced something that has completely baffled everyone who works there. On one of her night shifts, she and another nurse were working together. There's a small staff room in the back building that only employees have access to. No patients ever go in there. It's just a small square room with a few windows and a fridge where they keep their lunches, and a single door that opens inward at some point during the night. My aunt went to grab her food from the fridge for her break, but when she tried to open the door, which you have to like push it into the room to open, the door wouldn't move more than about 4 inches. Something was blocking it from the inside. So she pushed harder and realized that the refrigerator itself had somehow been moved across the room and was now sitting directly in front of the door, blocking it completely. And this fridge is heavy. It's not something you can just slide around. It normally stands to the right of the room, several feet away from the door. Somehow it had been moved all the way over and positioned perfectly so that the door could only open a few centimeters. My aunt and her co worker had to use all their strength to push the door open just enough to squeeze inside. When they finally got in, they expected to find someone, maybe a patient, trying to hide or escape, but no one was in there. They were thinking that maybe a patient had broken into the room, maybe barricaded the door with the refrigerator, and then jumped out of the window, even though it was the second floor. So that would seem very unlikely. But when they entered the room, no one was in there. And all of the windows were closed from the inside. And nothing really looked disturbed except from the fridge. There wasn't even a sign that anyone could have entered or exited. And again, it was a restricted room and no patients had any reason to be there. They checked everything. The floor wasn't wet or slippery. The fridge wasn't malfunctioning. It was just moved Somehow. A few weeks after my aunt told me this story, she told me there was another part to the story because about a week or two later, another nurse went into that same room. And there's a mirror on the wall. And as she looked into the mirror, she saw a person standing behind her in the reflection. But when she turned around, no one was there. And this all happened in a fairly new building, not some old creaky hospital with like crooked floors or anything that would make the fridge slide. So there's no explanation. Like, it's just so creepy, I think. And nothing like this has ever happened before. Since my aunt isn't really someone who believes in the supernatural. I'm not from a religious family. She's not religious. In Denmark, people aren't super spiritual. But after that night, I think that she doesn't really know what to think and I don't know what to think about this story.

So here we go. Hopefully you can understand what I'm saying. I met my wife at school when she was 17 and I was 18. We had been together for about nine months and we were going to have our first trip away as a couple. We were going a drive to Blackpool from Edinburgh. It's about three or four hours drive. We were going away for the weekend and to make things easy, my wife girlfriend at the time, stayed over at mine for the first time. Normally I would stay at hers. And nothing strange had ever happened before. Well, we went to bed early as we needed to leave the house about 4am in order to drive down. We were awoken by a very distinct knock on the door. Like a kind, you know, the sort of classic noise. And that was about 1:00am Figuring it was someone at the wrong door, I just ignored it. When it happened for a second time, my girlfriend suggested answer it in case it was an emergency or like parents or something. I told her I'd just leave it. And the knock happened for a third time, quickly followed by a loud bang. It sounded like the front door opening. You know how you know what your door sounds like. We counted the footsteps up the stairs to the top landing. I was sure someone was in the house. I watched as the handle on the door moved and the door swung open and there was no one there. No further footsteps were heard. I searched the entire house for the intruder. I'm sure that was there, but found no one. The front door was closed and locked. The street was deserted. I even went out in the street and walked up and down to see if there was anybody there. I thought it might have just been a drunk person or something, but nobody there at all. I went back up to bed to check on my my girlfriend Hayley. And she was fine, all cuddled up and half asleep. I couldn't understand how she could be so calm when we both clearly heard something come into the house and into her room. She laughed at me and told me to come back to bed as there was no one to find. I kinda argued that there must be someone somewhere and she needed to help me look. She sat up in the bed and said she would deal with it. I'm like, what do you mean deal with it? So she patted the beds next to her for me to sit down and when I did, she said, very funny. You got him. It's nice of you to visit, but this isn't our house, so you need to go home and I'll be back in a few days. With that, the bedroom door closed. We carried the footsteps back down the hall, the stairs, heard the front door bang and the distinct knock on the front door again. My girlfriend Hayley looked at me, smiled, and said, see, I told you there wasn't an intruder. She cuddled back in and was asleep in minutes the remainder of the night, not knowing what the hell had just happened. And that's what life is like with my creepy wife.

So it was September, October time, around 2003. It was a cool, dry evening. It was winter, so it was quite dark early here. So I was out with some friends heading home about 8:30pm and we just moved into a new house, new development area. And to get a shortcut home, I used to cut through the storage area where they used to store all the diggers and stuff and equipment at nighttime. And as I was walking through, it was just quiet. And I got this eerie feeling, dread and fear. I didn't know what it was, so I continued to walk on. So nearly home, I turned the corner, kicking stones, and as I looked up, there was this huge cat standing about 20ft away, extremely still, just staring at me. This thing was huge, huge for a cat. It was about the size of a collie, sleek, black, the biggest green, round eyes. In the dark, they were like lanterns, just piercing, just straight forward. It looked about 50 kilos, maybe about 2 meters from nose to tail. It didn't make any noise. It lowered itself down slightly. One left paw was just ahead. It almost looked like it was about to pounce. And I was absolutely terrified. I thought, don't run. If I run, it could chase. So I stood tall. I roared at it, I stamped the ground. This thing didn't budge. It started to take slow steps forward, so I decided to go backwards, start to step off slowly. And I seen the fences of the houses. So I thought, I'm gonna make a break for the fences and hope it doesn't come after me. So I went back about three steps slowly and ran for the fence and hopped the fences, ran straight through my back door, shouting at my mum and dad like, there's this huge cat outside chasing me. And they Were like, why is up, Gabe? You're full of rubbish. Like, what were you smoking? So no one believed me. This really, really annoyed me. No one believed me. I know this sounds bizarre. We live in Ireland. There's nothing bigger than a badger, domestically wild. So I was sitting at home doing my homework one night, it was about seven days later, and the area where they keep the diggers, they have security guards at night. And he come running out screaming from his hut that there was a large cat. And I was like, mom, I told you. He witnessed the cat, he said, huge. It was really a dog that was eating his lunch at his back, he said. So I decided, then after telling the story to my wife and stuff, we decided to research it. And the stuff we found online was insane. Around that time, about three months before, there was two large cats, a panther and a puma, released about 70 kilometers from my hometown in a town called Bush Knolls. They were killing livestock, pets. The government were called in. The USPCA had managed to track these animals till a small town called Ballybogee. But the animals got away. So these animals then obviously moved south towards my area. I live near the Mourn Mountains and stuff. You can search them online. Huge forested areas. There's loads of documents online. There's a site called blatherdebt.net, where people have reported them. The PSNI, the Police Service of Northern Ireland, from 2009 in the Freedom of Information Act. There is so many documented cases of the large puma and panther esque cats in our area and they're still being sighted today. As I said, when I moved in this area, our home was a new build. On our local paper, there was the front page when the men lay concrete. A large cat had walked through the concrete and left a pipe print. It was in the dying Democrat, so everybody says it. Love the podcast. Thank you very much.

I am originally from the uk, but I've moved over to Sweden. I'm here to tell you my story about what happened when I was back in the uk. So this is going back quite many years now. Maybe when I was about 14, 15 years old, I was out with some friends. And this is in the area called Buckinghamshire. And we were visiting this old abandoned. It's a g health center. The best way to describe is like a small house, really, and it was down a small, really long back road and it was at the end of the back road. There was no houses around it. There was just lots of fields and a bit of a wooded area surrounding it. And this place has been abandoned for quite a while. I've been there previously with friends. A little bit boring. There's nothing in there. Kind of, you know, people have been there and they've wrecked it and whatnot. But this time I went with two of my friends and it was completely boarded up. People obviously knew that, you know, everyone's been inside of it. So they've put big steel kind of casings all around the windows and the doorway. So we were searching for about half an hour for a way to go in there and have a look about. But there was no way of getting in here, Derek. It was just completely sealed off. Every single entrance you can imagine is just sealed off. One of our friends had a phone call, so he decided to walk off away from the house and to get where the house is, there's a little wooden gate. So you climb over the small wooden gate and then you walk for maybe about a minute until you get to the house. And it's all overgrown around the house, but you can clearly walk around it. So he's walked away and he's behind some trees. He's quite far away to the distance where, you know, we can't hear him on the phone and whatever. So it was just me and my one other friend, you know, we still kind of wanted to get in, have a look about. So we were still somewhat looking around. So we went to the backside of the house again. So this is even further away from where the entrance to the house is and even further away from our friend. So we have the whole house, you know, a blocking where our friend is. We have a walkway and trees there as well. So there's almost no way that we'd be able to hear our friend unless he kind of shouts at the top of his lungs or anything like that. And then all of a sudden, me and my friend, we hear like a jack in the box. If you don't know the tune, you can obviously have a look, but go something like. And it'll keep doing that until obviously the jack in the Box jumps out. And me and my friend, we heard this sound faintly coming from inside of the building, inside of the house. And I mean, I'm getting chills now speaking about it, because it's just almost unexplainable. I mean, I'd love to hear what you have to say about it, but this tune was so faint, and you could hear it almost directly coming from inside of the building. And as I said, if this was our friend that was playing it, you know, he must have been either inside the building, which he wasn't, or he must have been so close for us to hear it. But maybe after about five seconds of hearing this, me and my friend looked at each other and our faces both dropped. And I think we both knew, like, this is not right. So we didn't actually say a word to each other. After we looked at each other, we sprinted past the house, we threw ourselves over this gate, and to our surprise, we saw our friend there, still on the phone. And he's, like, super shocked because we've just come sprinting over the gate and towards him. And he's like, what are you guys doing? And we're like, were you not just messing about with us? He's like, I'm on the phone. I've been on the phone. And, you know, he wouldn't have had the chance to have played this tune and then run away and, you know, got to the position where he was and, you know, maybe not being out of breath or anything like that, you know, it was almost, you know, impossible for him to have done this and made this sound come from inside the building and then run away to the position he was in. He was, like, super shocked and saying, oh, you know, I don't get it. What did you guys hear? So we found a YouTube video, and.\n\n[Speaker A] Me and my friend were like, yeah.\n\n[Speaker F] Yeah, that's the one.\n\n[Speaker I] That's the one. Oh, my God. And, like, we were going crazy at the fact that we heard this. So faint, but yet so clear coming from inside this building that was so, so secure. And then we kind of all got a bit freaked out after that and decided to make a walk away from the building and back to where kind of the main roads were and more houses and civilization. It's super, super strange. I think about it a lot. But, yeah, absolutely. Love your podcast. You and all your team are absolutely amazing. Please keep on doing what you guys are doing. You make so many people happy. Thank you.

So this would have happened around 92, 93, when I was three or four. These are some of the earliest memories I have. It's very vivid to me still, even, you know, 30 odd years later. So what would happen is when I was in bed and I would be awake when this happened, like sort of I'd already awoken. I wouldn't wake up to the experience more so I would awake and then the experience would happen. So I would wake up and I would turn my head to look into the room and these beings, I guess these apparitions would appear. There was always two of them. They were small, like low to the ground. And they were essentially, I guess, made out of light, like a white light that was brighter in the middle and sort of faded out around the edges of them. And the best way I can describe the shape is like the corner of a blanket. And not just in shape, but in some way. It was almost like it was fabric. Like they were made out of fabric that was made out of light. They didn't have features, there were no faces, there were no limbs. But there was a definite three points to them with the point at the top and then two at the bottom. Just like a triangle, like think of a comforter, a duvet. It was sort of like that, but I got the sense that it wasn't filled with anything like a sort of billowed out fabric corner, but made out of light. So they would be there and they would be sort of speaking directly into my brain, I suppose, and saying that they had something very important that they had to tell me. They had some very important information. And please don't be afraid because we have to tell you. Of course I would be very afraid. So I remember hiding under the blankets and after a little while I would peek out and they would be gone. So I can't say if this happened every night, but it happened a lot. And it didn't stop happening until we moved out of the house that we were in. So just before I turned five. And it honestly got to the point where it was happening so often that I almost wasn't scared anymore. But the thing is, I still did not want to talk to them. I didn't want to have anything to do with them. So they would appear, I would meet immediately, put the blanket over my head and then take it off and they would be gone. So it was almost like it became a signal for them to leave. Strange thing is, my sister slept in the same room with me and she was a bit older, she was around 7 or 8. But she was never awake when any of this happened. And to be honest, we did not have a great relationship as we got older. So it was never anything I bought up to her. Unfortunately, she's no longer with us, so it's not something I can ask her about now. I don't recall telling my mum any of this at the time. I think possibly just because as a very small child, I don't think I really had the language to explain what was happening. But I do remember telling her as I got older. And she told me that quite often she would hear footsteps up and down the hallway in the house and that there was one particular room that was sort of like a playroom. The door would be closed, no one would be in there. And she would hear sort of shuffling around and like, and very low voices as if there were people in there. So maybe the whole house was haunted. I don't know the history of the house. It was very old. The suburb that it was in is one of like the earliest in the country, really. The only other thing that happened to me personally in the house was I would also have a recurring dream. It was a very linear dream and I was an observer rather than a subject in the dream. It didn't seem related to these apparitions at all either, which is strange. But there we go. So were the two connected? Who would know? Thank you so much for having this podcast and giving people the chance to tell their stories and.

I mean this happened, geez, back in the mid-90s. Now for years and years I thought it was the Men in Black, but with stories that I've heard from the podcast and all the rest of it, it doesn't seem to be like them at all. I was about six years old and I had this dog named Sting. Great dog. Him and me had this really good connection. I'd always sleep on the end of my bed and all the rest of it always be together, would always be playing together. He'd always look after me. Anyway, there's this one particular morning I woke up would have been about 6, 6:30 in the morning and the dog wasn't at the end of the bed. Right away I had this gut feeling that something wasn't right. I went searching for him around the house and didn't see him in his normal spots in his bed or on the couch in the parents room. We had this driveway that went down to the main road. So I ran down there and I see the Sting dog laying just outside the gate on the side of the road there. When I seen him I didn't see anything around, nothing. I just saw the dog. I get to the gate, I jump on top of the gate to see what's going on and then I see a car driving off. It's just hit my dog and it's driving off. I look back and I don't know what I was really looking at at the time. I was more worried about my dog. But when I'm looking at my dog, I see five men in black suits and hats and they're standing there in like a half arc around my dog. Every single one of them had a notepad and they're writing stuff down, like, notepad and a pen. I was like, what the hell? Why aren't you helping my dog? One of them looked up at me, like, you can see us kind of thing. Didn't say anything. He just put his head back down and started doing his thing. They look like just normal people. I didn't feel any bad negative energy or anything like that. Just like normal people. Just hiding her notepad. I looked around to make sure there's no other cars. There's no other cars in the area. You're on a main road and there was cars driving past, but there was no other cars parked on the side or anything where somebody got out or anything like that. So I had no idea where they came from. As I said, when I was running down the driveway, there was no one there. As I jumped on the fence, these five guys in black suits were there. Now, this has all happened within a short period. I jumped back off the fence. I've ran probably maybe 5 meters, and I've turned back to have a look because I was going to go and go get my mum. As I've turned back to have a look, those five men in black suits were gone. I've always called them Men in Black, but if it's not the real Men in black, the way that they've been described, or anything like that, I've always wondered and thought, what if they're angelic creatures or angels writing down notes to collect my dog's soul when he passed away? It's baffled me for years. Can't think of anything that would describe what I actually saw that day. But yeah, Loving the podcast.

My name's Jack, from Australia.\n\n[Speaker I] Got a little story for you.\n\n[Speaker D] That's when I was a lot younger, I was visiting my granddad, my mother's father, in a place up on the north coast. And I would have been maybe 10 at the time. The place was just known to be a bit weird. Like there were stories of a yeti around, which is like an Australian version of Bigfoot, just a bit of sus area. Anyway, I was asleep one night and my sister, me and my mum were all in the same room and there was the lounge room beside it. The lounge room is in like the middle of the house and all the bedrooms and bathroom were around it. Think of it as like a square. The middle is a living room. We're in one of the rooms and I remember just looking in the direction of the door and seeing a light under it and thinking that was weird. But then I thought maybe my granddad was up watching TV late at night, he couldn't sleep or something. So I get up and I open the door and in front of me, maybe like a meter away, is this little figure, maybe three feet tall, like a meter. And I just remember his head being really pointy, like it was wearing a hat. But I couldn't see it super clearly because it had flashing lights on it.\n\n[Speaker I] That were super bright. I kind of couldn't see behind them.\n\n[Speaker D] They were so bright. I could see the outline of this little figure, like a pointy head, little body. It was like a mix between a robot and an elf.\n\n[Speaker I] Anyway, so I just got really scared.\n\n[Speaker D] Shut the door, turned the light on in the bedroom, and this is what made it kind of like a core memory of mine. I just remember my mum getting super annoyed at me for turning the light on and getting into trouble the next day, waking her up during the night. And I was just trying to explain to what I saw. So we both went out and opened the door. Nothing was there, obviously. But yeah, I just remember the time in the room. Like it felt like time had slowed down, like it was going at a different pace. It's like whatever that thing was, it was like distorting reality or something, you know? It's something that stuck with me my whole life.

So my story begins at midnight. I had my own little house beside my parents house. I just fell asleep or was super close. Well, I hear my front door opening. I hear someone come in. In my mind, it's my mom.\n\n[Speaker F] I'm sleeping on a loft, so I.\n\n[Speaker D] Can'T really see if someone's standing in my living room. She's whispering something and I can't really hear what she's saying. But after the encounter, I think she's saying something like, I think she's asleep. So I ask my mom, what? No answer. Well, I'm fully awake now. I sit up in my bed and see something standing on a ladder to my loft. And I think to myself, why is my mom standing on the ladder?\n\n[Speaker F] Do you know what does that?\n\n[Speaker D] Well, I turn on the lights beside me and see the thing is gone. The thing is, there's not a ladder where the person was standing. So that means the person, or whatever the thing was has to be at least seven foot because I'm six foot two and I can only reach the top of the wall with my fingers. So yeah, that's it. I don't know what I saw. Maybe you have a theory. I have attached a photo of my room.

I've been listening to your podcast for quite some time and I absolutely love it, but I've never called in before so this is my first. And to start off with, I wanted to back up someone else's story. I saw a very similar thing to a man who called in on season 12 episode 2, which I was just listening to listening to. He said that he saw some lights in the sky that he thought were UFOs and what he described was exactly the same to what I have seen here in Queensland, Australia. Only about three weeks ago I was outside at night, probably 8pm and I was just laying down watching the stars, watching satellites going past as I do quite often. So I know the difference between planes, helicopters, satellites, and being in the outback. It's quite clear there's not a lot of light pollution. And I saw exactly what he saw. These lights that were not aircraft, they would zip across the sky and then at 90 degree angles they would change to their direction. And there are about three of them on that night. Anyway, have a great night.

The first story that I'd like to share is actually from when I was younger. I was about 7 or 8, and me and my family lived in Phoenix, Arizona, in a pretty decent home. But this home was haunted. And there were a lot of different things that would happen in this house. Like, my father would hear voices, but there would be no tv. We would be asleep or not home. My father would also be trying to fall asleep, and he would feel somebody sit on the bed, thinking that it was my stepmother. But she would be working at night, so it obviously wasn't her. One time we walked into the home and all of the cabinets were open and the drawers were open. It became such a thing in our house that we started calling the ghost Fred. And Fred was super harmless. Nothing malicious about the energy of the house. Like, you would walk in, and it was a normal house, and you could feel an energy, but it wasn't bad, nor was it necessarily comfortable. But a couple of specific experiences I wanted to talk about. So the first one, this was back in, like, 2007 or 2008, when TAPS was still a show on TV. And this is the show that predated Ghost Adventures. And it was super awesome. But I was sitting on the couch with my father one evening. He is a musician, so he was playing his guitar. And we had just gotten done watching an episode of Taps on Tombstone, Arizona. And I'm sure you have lots of stories about Tombstone, but me being a kid, I was talking about how much I don't believe in ghosts and how ridiculous of a notion it is that things exist like that and that they would have any power over us as beings. And, you know, in a silly way, I was just saying it was dumb, basically. And my dad's sitting there, he's smiling at me, and he looks at me, you know, kind of quirky, and says, well, you know, ghosts come after the ones that don't believe. And no sooner does he get done saying that than the lamp in our living room, the only source of light, shuts off. And so for a second, I was stunned. You know, I'm seven, and I'm just saying how stupid ghosts are. And all of a sudden, the light turns off. And the way that this lamp was, at first we were like, oh, we got unplugged Somehow. And we were used to Fred. So we were like, you know, whatever. We'll go plug it back in. And my dad's like, well, it's plugged into the wall. And so we think, oh, well, the light bulb must be loose. My dad goes to mess with it. He's like, no, the light bulb is nice and tight. The way that this lamp was, was it had a dial switch. So on the left side, you would have to click it to turn it on. And you would have to unclick it and turn it 180 degrees and click it on the right side to turn it off. The dial had been unclicked and turned off and clicked on the right side. And so we figured, oh, well, it's fret. He just turned the light off to say, see? Told you so. Another instance in this home was my parents bought me a toy dog that, with batteries, it could turn on, it could blink, it could jump around, it could yip and yap and all of the things. And one night I was sitting, and this dog turned on by itself and started doing things. I was so scared, I freaked out. I threw the toy across the room. I showed it to my dad. My dad almost didn't believe me. But again, there were so many stories about this house. You know, weird shadow men and things that would disappear. And so, yeah, that is my haunted house story. We moved out of that home. Thought Fred would follow us, but he didn't. So, yeah. Thanks.

However, the story I'm about to tell you happened actually in Montana, probably close to 50 plus years ago. It actually happened to My mother in law and my sister in law and my mother in law told me the story first. And my sister in law, I was so intrigued by the story, I asked her and she confirmed the same story through her eyes. So it starts with those two driving in Montana, and they were going up a mountainous or hilly region with a steep embankment down to the right of their vehicle. And in those days, at least in this section, there weren't guardrails along this embankment. And also in those days there wasn't a requirement to wear seat belts, which weren't as good as they are now, but they were still helpful. And I know my mother in law did not like wearing seat belts. So most likely she and or her daughter weren't wearing them at the time. Anyway, as they're going up this steep region, coming around the bend was a semi truck which had crossed over the center lane as it was coming around the corner and was going straight for them. And my mother in law, in reaction, veered off to the right down this steep embankment. And my mother in law is a very religious person. And so she was one of those people that practiced religiously, went to church all the time and devoted her life to her family and to her faith. So she began exclaiming, help us, God, oh Lord, help us, Lord, help us. As they're going down this hill. Because she knew it was certain death is there going down this bumpy, steep road. And they were going to die because, and that's, you know, the reality of it. How would they survive it, at least in her mind? And then the next second she knows she's on the road again going straight, not down that embankment. There was no way possible physically in our natural world that she could go one second down this hill and the next she's back on the road again. She looks over at her daughter, who was braced up against the glove compartment of the car with her hands on it with her head looking out the window with her mouth wide open in awe. And her daughter says to her, mama, Mama, an angel picked up the front of our car and put us back on the road again. And she swears to this day that's what happened. She's a schoolteacher, works with special children. She's an amazing lady. I trust her statement. I've known her for most of my life. And both of them, they're not people that would just tell a story like that. It truly happened to them. They both experienced it, they both told the story from their perspective with the slight difference of being my mother in law didn't see the being with wings like my sister in law did. She knew something happened because she couldn't explain it. To this day that story still gives me chivers and a good feeling inside that we're being watched over.

This story happened to me when I was about four or five and actually we were living in a small little town in Illinois called Fairberry. My dad was a minister and was trying to find a place to put our church. So he had been doing some work for a lady whose husband had recently died and she was looking to utilize the funeral home that they had. So he rented that out from her. And so we actually lived in the parsonage area of the funeral home. And I always just had like a weird creepy feeling, you know, as a four year old, five year old, I didn't really know a lot about ghosts or I didn't really think a lot about what that might mean. But one night, it was somewhere around bath time, I remember, you know, the lights were kind of dim in my room and my parents would give me a old realistic cassette recorder and I would just put in my room while I played. And they would send the tapes in to my grandma. So this one night I'm in my room and I'm getting ready for bed or whatever and I just heard this noise come from the cassette recorder and it just sounded like an old kind of crony lady. That's at least the closest I could get. It just kind of sounded like hello. And I immediately looked at the cassette recorder because it seemed to be coming from there. And I thought maybe it was on play, maybe it was stuck or something like that. And I mean, he was totally off. It was not on at all. I always just had a weird feeling about that. I ran and told my parents and they were like, ah, we don't know. So I don't know if it was just, you know, four or five year old's imagination or. Or if, you know, one of the people from the funeral home just was looking for an avenue to reach out, I'd love to know. But before that, my parents had lived in another neighboring town called Pontiac. And the house that I moved into right after I was born, my mom said that the upstairs of the house when they first moved in wasn't finished yet. It had kind of been trashed out and stuff. So they just kind of used it for storage space for the first little while. And she would be down in the kitchen and the stairway up to the top of the second floor was directly off the kitchen. And so she would be in the kitchen getting stuff ready. And they would hear like furniture being scooted across the floor. It was like a wooden subfloor or whatever. And they would just hear stuff being scooted across or dropped and slammed and opened. And so my dad, you know, being a minister, just got a friend and they went up there and they prayed, told the spirit it wasn't allowed to live there anymore. And then they said it never came back. So, don't know, it's kind of one of those weird stories I heard much after the fact, thankfully, because I don't think I would have slept at all if I would have known that when I was little. But anyway, love the show. Thanks so much for giving me lots of sleepless nights.

I was just listening to an episode, I think it was season 16, and this guy talked about when he had his baby and then there's a big light in the room and it kind of reminded me to want to tell my story. This was before I was born. Like, I want to say a month or two before I was born, my mom told me this story and she had said that she had already had my name. Says she wanted to name me Darlene. Disclosure, I'm not going to give my name, but that's my middle name now. So she said that she had a dream before she had me. And in the dream she said that she had this strong white light come up to her. She couldn't really see it. It was like a shining light. How she described it, like someone's coming close to you, but you're kind of blinded by the light. And she said there was a voice that told her to name me. My first name. I don't want to say, but it told her to name me that and that it slowly faded away and that she ended up waking up and she was just like, wow. And I had asked her, like, oh, well, you know, were you scared? Was this a scary feeling for you? Like, what was it? She had said that it was a very peaceful feeling. She wasn't scared at all. And that that happening made her give me my name now and that she wasn't a Nami Darlene. But then she ended up putting that as my middle name. And yeah, that's kind of my story. I just thought it was so interesting and neat and how that guy, when his daughter came in and there's a strong light. Only when like people are born does that seem to happen. And I believe in angels and demons. And I don't know, I like to think of it as like my guardian angel kind of guiding her.

I was approximately six years old, and, you know, I'm laying in the bed beside my mom and dad. I had a hard time sleeping by myself back then, and all of a sudden, I just woke up. I can't recall anything in particular waking me up. And I didn't wake up startled or anything like that. There was no loud noises that woke me up. I just kind of woke up. I see the outline of something kind of hovering over my face. There was a night light in my mom and dad's master bathroom, and it was surprisingly bright enough to kind of give a very small glimmer of light into the rest of their bedroom. And that's probably how I was even able to see the outline of whatever was hovering over me. I couldn't make out a ton of the details, but here's what led me to believe that it was what I recall as the Sandman. The outline of this thing looked much like what you would see depicted in cartoons and movies and things of that nature of the sandman. So, you know, I'm awake, and all of a sudden I see the classic outline of a wizard hat, you know, fairly baggy clothing. It freaked me out. It was not a welcoming sight for me to, you know, see a dark figure hovering over me. And so I screamed. And as soon as I screamed, I hear a sound like a. And I feel a type of material literally hit my eyes. And I immediately fall asleep. I mean, a deep sleep. It was almost as if this thing knocked me out with whatever it threw at me, you know, the next morning when I woke up, I asked my parents, did you see that thing? What thing? You know. What are you talking about? I saw the Sandman. And, you know, they passed it off as just a young boy's imagination. I was like, no, no, no. I saw something, and it threw something in my eyes. They're like, oh, you know, jw, we all have that in our eyes when we wake up. And, yes, I understand now that I'm 33 that there's some biology involved with what you wake up, the crust on your eyes. I get it. But even still, now, as an adult, I still stand by what I saw that night, what I experienced, what I felt. I don't know what it was, but to this day I just call it the Sandman. I've never told anyone about this ever, other than my parents. Anyways, I appreciate your hard work for us, Derek. Peace.\n\n[Speaker B] Well folks, what do you think? Weird enough for you?

Let's start off mostly the beginning of the year. I work a night job, 12 hour shifts. We're allowed to go outside and walk the premises if we get too tired. You know, try to stay awake. So in summertime, I like to go out, walk around the building, do a couple laps, you know, a couple rounds, just to stay awake. There was a time where I got into mobile gaming, Call of Duty. I wasn't able to pick up servers inside the building, so I go outside. This is about between 2:45 and 4:00 clock in the morning. I'm sitting beside my car, play my game. So beside the parking lot at my job, there's a church and they have a cemetery. So as I'm sitting by my car playing this mobile game, all of a sudden, up to my left, I hear a hello. Now, to me, a hello is words that some older generation will use. So when I heard this hello, I looked over to my left. I didn't see nothing. Now, across from the cemetery, there's a couple houses. And I've been out there sometimes and all I see is their lights on. Never have seen anybody out there that late. So when I hear this hello, I get this, I don't know, odd feeling. It's just shivers down my spine. Just talking about it now just brings shivers right back. Just the way I heard this hello was like somebody was forcing to say this hello. It's just freaking creepy, man. After I heard that hello, I looked down at my mobile game for a split second and I walked my butt right back inside the building. I didn't run, I walked. I thought if I run, this thing's gonna come after me. Thank you. Hope to hear my story and hope you can use it.

But the story I'm going to tell happened in Green Bay, Wisconsin, maybe. Oh, geez, 30 years ago, I guess to start, I'll say this, having odd things happen when I was a kid, especially through my childhood teenage years, it was pretty normal, I guess. We didn't think too much about it, my family and I. I had three brothers and a sister. And, you know, odd things would happen, you know, toys turning on, doors opening and closing. We moved around a lot, but whatever those things were, they seemed to follow us around Whatever it was. But this particular story is the result of a rule I made for myself if I saw or heard anything, to make sure that it actually was there, that it wasn't my imagination. Very early in my life, I made a rule that if no one else saw it or heard it, it didn't happen. It was just my imagination. Well, one of these things that would happen to me fairly frequently as a child, maybe as far back as I can remember, eight or nine years old, occasionally I'd have nights where I was going to bed and I'd hear, oh, I don't know what you would call. Sounded like a crowd of people under my bed. As ridiculous as that might sound, it sounded like a crowd of people very far away. If you heard an old battlefield that they'll put on tv sometimes if somebody's remembering an old battlefield or something like that, they're remembering, like, the horror of the sounds of people screaming and the metal clashing. Well, if you take all the metal clashing out of. That's what I heard. It sounded like thousands of people, hundreds or thousands, I don't know, just yelling. Sometimes it would get louder and louder. I convinced myself this was all in my head. But at times when the voices got really loud, my bed would start shaking. And again, there's no one else there. Even though I shared a room with my brother, they had their own beds, you know, both my brothers did. So for years, I really thought this was my imagination, and I just went on with it. Then one day when I was a teenager, I was in a apartment that I was sharing with my brothers, and my cousin was there, my cousin Todd. We were taking turns sharing the bedroom, and it was my week for the bedroom. Todd was staying with us for the summer, and it was the middle of the day, and I don't remember why I was laying down during the day. I don't know if we were up late. It was during the summer. But I laid down to take a nap. And this is one of these times when I started hearing these voices and the bed started shaking, and it was broad daylight, which wasn't typical. And I was trying to figure out, you know what? I don't know if this is in my head or not. So I got out of my bed, went in the other room, and I told my cousin, hey, wanna come talk to me for a minute? I got something I want to talk to you about. So he said, sure. Came in the bedroom. I said, todd, have a seat. He sat down on the bed, immediately jumped back up and said, what's? Going on with your bed? It's shaking. And I thought I knew it. Now, we went and checked the other beds and it was only my bed shaking. And Todd, he didn't hear the voices. I could hear them, but he couldn't hear them. And I didn't tell him that I heard him. And I didn't tell him the bed was shaking beforehand. But he was convinced and he was freaked out a little bit by all of it, obviously. I guess the funny part of the story is this. I felt very vindicated until it got dark. And at that point, I didn't feel so much vindicated, just kind of terrified, thinking to myself that was really happening all those years. Well, in any case, eventually it stopped. I would say in my late 20s, a lot of that stuff that was happening just went away. That was on Mather street in Green Bay, Wisconsin. That happened. Thank you for your time.

I used to be a resident of central Illinois, and it would have taken place during the early 2000s. I grew up in a parsonage, which, for anyone who does not know what that is, that is the home provided by a church to a ministerial family where the pastor and their family will live. Typically, the only people who will have ever lived in a parsonage would be a pastor's family for that specific church. Well, my story in regards to that house isn't too, too significant. It was just when I was in middle school, maybe around, like, 12 years, I had been watching TV, and during the. You know how sometimes they have, like, a little blackout period between commercials if it just couldn't be cut correctly? It was like that. And in the screen, I saw a very tall black shadow walk through the archway that reflects off of the tv. And I was completely home alone. So naturally, you know, being 12, that is more than enough to freak me out. I felt like I was being watched. I, like, felt frozen in my little spot. It's been maybe 18 years since that happened. However, the real story is a year after that, we had moved to Southern Illinois, and the pastor who took over for my father, she had moved into the same house, the same parsonage. Well, she called us after we had moved about a year later, and she said, how do I get these kids at the church to stop messing with me? And my dad was like, what are you talking about? We never had any issues with pranksters or anything like that. Nothing whatsoever. Not at all. So much so that we would often leave the doors unlocked. What she had said is that she had been hearing people running up and down the hall in this little house when she was home alone. She lived by herself. Not married, no kids. She even came home once after service to the kitchen faucet on and all of the kitchen dining room tables on top of the dining room table. So all the chairs on the table and the faucet on. That is definitely a classic, spooky story. But the most compelling part was that she was very anti all of that. She didn't believe in any of that stuff. So she was certainly convinced after that. But that's the last I ever heard of that story. So whoever's living there now, I hope they're having a pleasant experience. Thank you very much. Monsters Among Us podcast for your awesome stories.

I guess this was back in about 2017. My son was about 4 years old, and I was getting him ready for school, and we were in the bathroom, he was getting a bath, and he looks at me and he says, mama, who's that man over by the sink? And I look over and I said, son, there's not a man there. And he says, yes, mama, there is. And I said, well, what's he look like? And he says, well, he has long hair, glasses, wearing a white dress and sandals. And I was, like, a little spooked out, so I was like, oh, okay, well, let's go get dressed. So I wrap him up in a towel, we go to a whole nother room, and I'm getting him ready, and he looks at me and he says, mama? I say, yes, son. He says, that man? I said, yeah, what about him? And he says, he followed us. He's behind you. And I'm like, oh, okay. Well, let's go to school, finish getting him ready, and I put him in the car, and we go on to school. Well, later that day, I called my mother, and I said, mama, Damon saw a man in the bathroom today. And she says, I wonder if he saw Jimmy, which is my stepdad, who actually passed away in that house from cancer. I was like, I don't know. And she said, well, I'm gonna send you a picture, and you show it to him when he gets home. And I said, okay. So I showed him the picture, and he started crying. He says, mama, Mama, that's the man. That's the man. And I was like, oh, well, that's just papa Jimmy, you know? And he actually passed away before I found out I was pregnant with my son. So my son actually never knew him. A couple days later, he comes running out of his bedroom. I'm in the kitchen cooking. And he says, mama, that man, he's back in my room. And I was like, okay. So I walked in there and I said, listen, I know that you're just checking on him, but you're scared of my son. Would you please leave? And he's never come back again. I have one more story. It's actually another ghost story in the same house that I was living at the time that happened with my son. My husband worked night shift at the local chicken plant and would leave about one o' clock in the morning and about an hour or two later I would have my bedroom door shut. And of course I'd have all my children with me because I'm a scaredy at night. I don't like being alone. And so I'd have all of my babies with me. And so I close my door and we would sleep with the door shut. Well, about two, three o' clock in the morning, my bedroom door would slam open and hit the wall and my bed would start shaking. And this happened almost every night. And I'd wake up scared, sit up straight, look around, see if I could see anything. And I wouldn't see nothing. So I'd lay down and I'd try to go back to sleep. But first it took me a while to go back to sleep, but then I got used to the door slamming and the bed shaking and I just go back to sleep. That's my story. I love your podcast.

When I think back on some of the strange or odd experiences I've had through life, going way back to when I was just a young child, I remember when I was in middle school, I had to walk probably about two and a half or three miles to get to school, and then the same thing back. Occasionally I got a ride, but a lot of times I walked, and it wasn't bad. I didn't mind it. It's just when it was snowing or raining, it kind of sucked. But the one memory I had, which at the time was just kind of neat, unique, interesting, never really thought much of it, but later in life kind of looked back and said, yeah, that was kind of creepy. Let me explain to you what happened. When I walked back from school. I go through all these back road areas, kind of a residential area, but there was also a stretch where there was a lot of space between houses. So there'd be a house with a large yard, and then the next house down wouldn't be for maybe, I don't know, 100 yards or so. So there was a lot of space between the houses, which Was nice for the people that live there. They have some privacy. But I know there was one house in particular. I noticed one day there was a sign out front that said Hockstetter's Taxidermy. And I'd met the fellow before Mr. Hockstetter. He was a friendly guy. I'd see him out by the roadway sometimes as he pulled in, and I would talk to him and say hello. And he'd say, hello there. How are you? Young fellow and nice guy. I'm guessing at the time he was probably in his late 50s, early 60s. He lived alone. You know, I thought, what is taxidermy? I thought maybe taxi driving people around places. But I think I mentioned it to my mom or dad, and they said taxidermy means that he stuffs animals. And I said, stuffs animals like a pinata, fills it up with candy.\n\n[Speaker C] And.\n\n[Speaker E] No, no, no. They explained what he does is that people bring him a dead animal, and then he pulls the skin off it, lets it dry, and then he kind of puts Styrofoam or something in the middle of it and then wraps the skin around it and then paints it and puts, like, a glossy finish to make it look real again. So he did this with animals. Anything from a field mouse up to a grizzly bear or a moose. Like, he did everything as well as fish. So I thought that was kind of neat. So the one time I came back from school, I kind of snuck by that house. I noticed that his car wasn't there, so I figured, okay, he lives alone. I'm just gonna go to the back to see, because at the back of his house, he had kind of an extension with some small windows. So I snuck back there. Nobody could see me because the house was pretty far from the next one. So no one could see that I was sneaking around. So I went down the window, put my hands up against it, looked inside, and when I looked inside, I saw all of these. You know, some of the animals and fish were up on the wall on plaques or on a piece of wood. And they look beautiful. Some of them were done and painted up, and they looked like they were alive. And some of them were just the skin of the animals that was just drying and curing, I guess, before he was to paint them. And there was everything there. There were squirrels, rabbits, fox, a moose head he was working on. One thing I always remember was, like, there was a raccoon. It was kind of up on its hind legs, like it was scared of something. But any case, I thought that was kind of Neat. So kind of made it. Part of my regular routine is on the way back because I had that long walk just to take a break. I would stop in and kind of sneak around the back to look in the window. And I'd look in, kind of see what new things he was working on. And even when he was home and I noticed his car there, there were hedges and bushes, so I could sneak back there and no one could see me. And I would watch him at work. I could see him stripping the skin off of both mammals and fish, doing his work, painting, putting glass eyes and things. And what I noticed, which I thought, oh, that's nice. Because, like I say, he was probably in his early 60s. I was surprised that his parents were still alive because I could see that his mom and dad, I'm assuming that's who it was, would be sitting there watching him at work. And both of them were just sitting side by side and just, you know, sitting there, kind of leaning forward a bit, kind of watching him do his thing, probably very proud. So I went there, I would imagine, probably, I don't know, 15 or 20 times. And I started noticing that they were always there watching. And I had thought he lived alone, and I guess he didn't. Unless maybe they came by for a visit. And every time I came, they would be sitting there watching him work and never moved. Just kind of sat there, kind of leaning forward, really watching intently as to what he was doing. And, you know, sometimes they'd be sitting close to him. Other times they'd be, you know, further back, somewhere else sitting there, but they're all sitting side by side was kind of heartwarming. I thought, that's so nice. His parents took an interest in what he did. So time went on and I kept coming by and I saw him. I think he did like a. Can't remember if it was a mountain lion or was it like a large wild cat of some kind. And one time he looked up and I thought he saw me, but he kind of looked out for a while. I kind of hid behind the hedge. And anyways, I kind of sat there. And probably three or four months later, I went there and there was suddenly a For Sale sign. And I look and I go to the back. His workshop area, we did the taxidermy was totally cleaned out. There was just some cardboard on the ground, some pails, pieces of wood, some scraps on the ground, but everything was cleaned out. And I didn't see his car, you know, in his parking spot. And I was kind of walking by the one day looking and nobody was there. And I saw a neighbor out front. I think they were mowing their lawn. I said, what's with Mr. Hockstetter? You know, it seems empty. I noticed his car hasn't been there. I said, oh, no. He packed up and moved a few days ago. He's gone as he moved. They're selling the house. He says, yeah. And I said, so just him and his mom and dad left? They said, oh, no, no, just him. He said, well, no. Where is mom and dad here visiting? He said, no, his mom and dad died like 15 years ago. They both passed at the same time. They were in an accident. They both passed. So he's been living there alone all this time. And I'm thinking, wait a minute, I saw them sitting there and I saw them sitting in different places. Yeah, they were always leaning forward in the same position, never moving.\n\n[Speaker D] Oh.\n\n[Speaker B] Thank you, Gary. Oh, shit is right. I think we can all put two and two together here. Mr. Ostetter, whatever his name was, might have been a little too good at taxidermy. So good that he even stuffed his own parents, allegedly. And that got us thinking over here in the studio. Has any other human ever been taxidermied? Well, the answer is likely to surprise you because the answer is yes. There have been several examples from over the years, including but not limited to centuries old cases of preservation of exotic tribesmen, circus performers and an 18th century visionary. This is Jeremy Bentham, an English philosopher and social reformer who died in 1832. Before he passed away, he compiled a set of instructions regarding the disposal of his body. It was first to be dissected, then preserved and displayed accordingly. Bentham's skeleton was padded out with hay, dressed in his clothes and put on display in his favourite chair, complete with a wax replica of his head. This auto icon, as Bentham referred to it, changed hands several times before ending up in University College London's student centre. Bentham is admired for many of his principles and so his preserved remains are displayed in accordance with his wishes. He was even allowed to sit in on a council meeting once in 2013, where he was recorded as present but not voting. That clip from Fascinating horror and shows us the light hearted side of human taxidermy, if such a thing exists. But what about the darker side? I hear some of you asking, and what about more current cases of this unusual practice? Well, given that human taxidermy is essentially illegal globally, so examples are few and far between, but I did manage to find something that almost checks off all of the boxes and it occurred in Penrose, Colorado just two short years ago. The following clip is courtesy of KUSA, NBC News 9 out of Denver. Outside the Return to Nature Funeral Home, investigators put up crime scene tape and searched through a hearse. Documents obtained by 9News highlight new details on what went on inside the facility where 115 bodies were found. The Colorado Department of Regulatory agency says the owner of the funeral home claimed he practices taxidermy at the Penrose location and acknowledged that there was a problem on the property. When police executed a warrant, they found evidence that human remains were imprisoned, properly stored and the owner attempted to conceal them.	3013.3	3619.5	ghost	Ontario,

This is Alex coming at you from Detroit, Michigan. I recently Watched your documentary, Derek. The High Desert One. Man, that was an epic film. And in that there's a scene which brought this out of me. So in the scene, this guy's talking about how he's on the highway and. And he sees these two lights that come up at him and he thinks they're UFO lights. That very same thing happened to me one morning driving from Detroit to Charlotte. I was going to work. It was about 6:30 in the morning, pitch dark. I'm the only one on the road. And I'm driving down the road and I look in the rear view and it looks like there's a freaking car. I see two lights coming right at me. This thing looks like it's going 130, 140 miles an hour. And it comes so fast. It did a quarter mile, half mile, mile in seconds. So I saw this and immediately I just braced for impact because it got so close. I thought for sure this dude's gonna hit me. He's coming right in and he's gonna freaking whack me. So all I remember is like, bracing, closing my eyes and like, wincing. And then nothing happened. And I opened my eyes and there was nothing there.

I'm a newer listener to the podcast and wanted to share my story. So I grew up in a Northern California town called Morgan Hill. My family lived in a very long ranch style home on about two acres with a smaller vineyard off of this road called Watsonville Road. The area is not necessarily the middle of nowhere, however, it's in a major agricultural area with no street lights where the homes can be really quite distanced apart. It was summer, I was home from college, so this must have been around 2012 or 2013. So I slept on one end of this long ranch home and my parents slept on the very other end. And Morgan Hill gets extremely hot during the summer, so I had the spots in my window angled slightly open to allow for some airflow. One night it was super late. I'd been up reading, probably about 1am or so. I turned off my lights and I was settling to go to sleep when something large appeared in my window. Now, I never got a great look at it. However, I noticed it immediately because it contains these like pulsating blinking lights and it just hovered in my window for a period of time. The first thought that occurred to me was that it reminded me a lot of the Disneyland light show because they were like multiple pastel colors in multiple shades. But the weirdest part about this thing in the window was that it was absolutely silent. You know, I've listened to similar stories about flying objects or UFOs on this podcast where people report hearing some kind of droning noise, but there was no noise that was coming from this thing. I was frozen in absolute terror. I've never felt that scared and shocked in my entire life or since then just because I couldn't make sense of it and I didn't really know what it was. Eventually I turned over to face away from it in bed and I sort of willed it to go away. I had like this overwhelming sensation that while it floated in my window, it was almost trying to decide whether it wanted to take me or not. And eventually, after what felt like an eternity, but probably wasn't any longer than one minute, this thing just sort of floated away and left my window. It was many years before I ever shared this story with anyone, so I thought I'd share it it here. It's been really formative in shaping my views on UFOs or any kind of mysterious stories that people share.

So this story took place something so years ago, little background. I am fifth generation farmer on the same property that my mother is farming on, My grandfather farmed on, his father farmed on, and so forth. This is in rural Oregon, closer to the town of Woodburn. This is probably the third house that I've lived in in this property. And it was the time where my grandfather had passed over the farm to my mother. So my family had moved into the main farmhouse. The main farmhouse has had several stories of just ghostly activity, voices, weird encounters, it goes on and on and on and on. But this one took place when I was probably 13 and it was one of the ones that stuck in my mind so much that I can remember the exact time that it occurred. So one night I'm sitting in my bed, I'm reading a book with my light on. It is 1:45 in the morning, very late, everyone is asleep. I have my window slightly cracked open, curtains drawn, because I do not like looking out at night. Something about it just gives me the heebie jeebies. I've never liked the farm at night. And I remember sitting there raining, and I just hear a cat coming from the window on my bedside. And I hear like a little kid's voice kind of echoey going, can I come in? Hello, can I come in, please? Hello? And I just stared dead at that window, did not acknowledge it, did not say anything back, reached over, turned my lamp off and laid down. And I knew it wasn't probably like a video or any audio that could have been played. I wasn't allowed any technology until I was like closer to high school. So I didn't have a phone, I didn't have a laptop, I had nothing that could have played this audio. I knew for a fact it was not my sisters playing a prank at me because my little sisters, one was probably like 12, one was probably 8 and the other was infant. And so they weren't gonna be on the second floor roof at 1:45 at night. And I knew it wasn't something playing around on the property, crawling onto the roof and trying to stare me. Because we live down a half a mile long driveway, our house is hidden by trees. We are surrounded by the forest, another farm field. No one actually knows our house is there. Like, even when we give them direction, they get very lost and very confused and they end up in our lower field somehow. But it absolutely horrified me. It's not like the first time I've had an encounter in that room. It is one of the original foundations of the bedroom. My grandmother had remodeled that house, like, twice or so. And then I know my great grandmother had remodeled that house once before. But out of the four upstairs bedrooms, these two bedrooms were the only two that had not been touched, and mine.\n\n[Speaker D] Was one of them.\n\n[Speaker A] I've had way too many encounters in that room for me to just chalk it up to nothing, but I had gotten so used to just ignoring it and pretending like it wasn't there because of how many times it happened. Like, my mother's had encounters when she slept in that room when she was a kid. My uncles have had the most. They both would swap this bedroom growing up because they both got couldn't handle what they were experiencing. But that was one of the most scariest ones. Like, I never heard voices before until that very night. And it made me feel like I was crazy because no one believed me when I would tell them. But thank you. Your podcast is great. Have a good one.

So back in about 2012. And I will preface this by saying that I had never known anything about death before this point. Shortly after this, my grandmother had passed and that was the first death I had ever experienced. So I had a prejudice going into everything as that everyone kind of lives until they're 90. So I used to clean houses and I went to clean a house and I had a second cleaner with me and she was focusing on the downstairs while I cleaned the upstairs. And I started in the master bedroom and bathroom and I was cleaning everything and I got to the bedroom which looked a lot like any other bedroom that you would expect from parents. And when I cleaned houses I used to try and make everything put back the way they were supposed to. But this particular house, I had thrown the pillows off to the side and As I was putting everything back, I was like, oh, I messed up how the bed was. And I heard a man speak, and he said, it doesn't matter. She sleeps alone. And I looked around because I heard it as clear as day. And I was really unsure because, I mean, maybe I had said it out loud or something like that. And I assumed that maybe a family member, maybe the son or something like that had come along. And I looked around. No one was there. I saw no one. And so I put everything back the way that I thought him might have been and just left at that. I was like, that was weird. And then I had went downstairs to see how my co worker was doing, and our supervisor came in to make sure that we were doing everything that was supposed to be done. And around that time, the homeowner's daughter had come around. And I heard my supervisor talking and going like, oh, that's a really nice telescope that you have over there. And the daughter was like, yeah, it was my dad. And that made my ears prick and going, what? And I was overhearing conversation, and she was like, yeah, my dad had died a couple years prior, and we have a plaque for him in our living room. And a little bit later, I had looked at it, and he had been a firefighter. He had died a few years prior. And she was talking about the family dynamic and how mom has been a widow since then. And that made my blood run cold because I had heard a man talk about mom saying, it does not matter. She flew balloon.

I wanted to tell you about a story that happened to us. It was last year, so it was Halloween, so we didn't take our daughter trick or treating that year. We were super busy with stuff. So we went to a church Halloween party near the house. And it was outside in the parking lot. And there's also a huge cemetery to the left of it. But this parking lot was really big, too. They had rides and different things. It was probably 15 minutes until dusk in the evening. So we have been around different rides and different things to do for our daughter. And we were just standing there in this one long line. So I was just kind of tired, kind of in a dazed state. My husband and I were standing pretty close. Our daughter was in front of us. And I hear what I thought was him. I heard him say something. And at the time, I didn't catch that. It was super fast, like almost inaudible super fast. At the time, I understood what it was, and I don't remember now what it was. And I looked at him and I said, what did you say? And he said, I didn't say anything. And I said, no, you said this. And at the time, I didn't catch how fast it was. And it was right in my ear. And he said, I didn't say anything. We've been standing here for the past two minutes not saying anything. And then as soon as he said, well, what did you say that? It said? And I could not even remember what was said in my ear. It was super weird. It reminded me of the audio that you shared a few years ago. The skies in the woods. And he's recording, and it just sounds like really just gibberish. It was like that's exactly what it sounded like. Like I said, we were right next to a cemetery. Could have been an entity trying to communicate. I have no idea. It could have been just me that I was tired. I was just staring off the days. I don't know. Anyway, thought it was interesting. Thought you might want to hear about it. Talk to you later, Derek.

I've been listening to your show for a couple of weeks now, and it's really triggering some memories that I've had. But today I just wanted to tell you about one in particular that really stuck out to me. So this happened in Salt Lake City, and It was about 12 years ago, maybe. I was staying with a friend of mine. I was there in Salt Lake for a convention. And he didn't have a spare bedroom. So I was sleeping in the basement on the couch. And I've always had kind of an aversion to basements because in the house that I grew up in, I always felt like I was being watched. Like, my entire life. Always felt uncomfortable in the basement. And I kind of felt this way in this basement, too, but I didn't really think anything of it. But when I was sleeping on the couch, I was kind of in a fetal position, and my body was turned towards the stairs, so I was facing away from the couch cushions. So in the middle of the night, I'm guessing it was probably somewhere between two and four. It was very quiet, and something woke me up. And so I kind of came to and I started hearing this shuffling. It was clearly footsteps shuffling on the carpet. And I knew it wasn't my friend because I just. My whole body. You know, when you get into those situations when you're around weird energy and, like, everything in my body just started to kind of prick. My solar plexus started going crazy, and I was just like, oh, my goodness. But the kicker is that it said, follow me. Wake up. And I just kind of curled into myself and said, nope. Said it in my mind. And I rolled over and kind of, like, scooted over towards the cushions. I didn't hear anything walk away. Nothing else happened. I went back to sleep. So the next morning, my friend came downstairs to check on me, and I asked him, I said, hey, do your girls whose bedrooms were in the basement? I said, have they ever said that they felt uncomfortable or anything? And his face turned white, and he was like, yes, they don't like coming down here. What happened? And I told him, and he was just like, oh, my gosh. But here's the crazy thing is it was his voice that said that to me. And I've heard things about, like, trickery, that sort of thing, like demons, like, showing up as little kids, that kind of stuff. I mean, I didn't sense that it was a demon, but I don't know. I mean, it was asking me to follow it, and I definitely did not have plans to do so. So I thought that was just kind of an interesting story that I wanted to share with you. And I love your show.

This Story takes place in Colorado. For background. I never considered myself someone who's very, you know, in tune with the supernatural. I'm not someone who's gone out of my way to at all mess with that. Up until this story happened, I was hanging out with some family in Colorado. It was my last day. I had a great time. I was out at my car packing up very early in the morning for the drive back to Arkansas. It was around 5, 6 in the morning, very, very early. I was the only person out in the street. I heard the very distinct voice of one of my family members telling me that they love me. And it was so precise and so real that I spun around and I was a little bit weirded out in the moment at the time. I chalked it up to being around family members, you know, same side of the family that all have relatively similar voices. And I just thought, I'm hearing something. It's obviously, you know, no big deal, right? Big day ahead of me. I forget about it. It took me a while to call in about this story because of the, you know, painful memory associated with it, because the family member whose voice that I heard happened to be my grandma. And she was not on this trip with us. I was out with her daughter, my aunt. And, you know, I just thought at the time, no big deal. I've been out to this place a dozen times with my grandma. Maybe I just associated it with her. The reason I'm calling in about the story is that specific day was the day that she passed. And I don't know what time of day that she passed due to the unfortunate circumstances around her passing. But, you know, I do think that if there is some way for her to get a message out, she's the type of lady that would have done it. And she wanted me to know that I love her. And yeah, it definitely has now shifted me into being more open about the possibility of that. And it gave me a little bit of hope, to be honest. It was a very sweet moment that I'm happy that I do sincerely believe she was able to break through whatever veil is there and tell me that she loved me. And, you know, I'm getting a little teary eyed thinking about it right now.\n\n[Speaker A] So thank you so much for the show, man.\n\n[Speaker D] You do a great job and looking forward to hearing this if you use it.

When I was about 19 or 20. I was currently living with my mom as I was doing my internship from my old college. And at this point, I already had many multiple paranormal experiences, but I never had something that happened like this. So I was in my bed. I was fully awake at the time. I know I've never had sleep paralysis or anything of the sort like that. But anyways, I felt something kind of crawling up my bed covers. It feels like, as if, like, imagine one of your pets is crawling under the bed covers and, like, coming near you, that kind of thing. That's exactly what it felt like. And at this point, I was pretty freaked out because I had no idea what the heck it was. And then all of a sudden, I felt something grab my ankle. It felt just like a hand, except I couldn't feel, like, any heat or cold, but I could feel the sensation of fingers wrapping around my ankle. At this point, I was absolutely terrified to look. I was too scared I was going to see something. So I just kind of did what any sane person would do in that moment and hid my head under the covers and hoped it would go away. So after what that was maybe 30 seconds or a minute, finally whatever grabbed my ankle just let go. I didn't really think much of it at the time because I was pretty scared. And I really didn't feel comfortable investigating it at first. But I did tell my mom later on, and she confirmed to me that she wasn't awake. She didn't play a prank on me or anything like that. So I'm not entirely sure what happened there, but that was the first time I've ever felt something. Anyways, moving on. I was starting my internship at a wildlife rehab center. And at this rehab center, we have a separate room off from the main room that has, like, all of our ICU patients. So I very distinctly remember going into the ICU room to take care of some of our really sick patients. And I remember when I went into that room, there was no one in the main room. It was only me in the ICU room. And for this room, there was a solid door and solid walls. Can't really hear anything that was happening outside of there. And no one could hear what was going outside that room. So when I was taking care of all the injured animals, I heard something thing lean into my ear and say, it's okay, Hannah. And I freak out. I remember screaming and falling over and frantically looking around this tiny 10, 5 foot wall trying to see if anyone was in there with me. And I saw nobody. So I'm still freaking out and I open up the door, look out the main room, and there's nobody out there. So I'm just like, okay, this is really freaking creepy. I have no idea what the heck just happened. But after that incident, I had yet to experience a paranormal encounter ever again. So what went from my most terrifying paranormal encounter to someone whispering in my ear to now? Just nothing happening to me. It's just it all seems kind of weird. And I can't verify that they're connected somehow, but for some reason just it seems like they possibly could be, considering I've yet to have another paranormal experience since that happened when I was 20 and I'm currently 24. Just thought it was pretty weird and wanted to share.

My friend lives over here in the town we live on, on the south end of town and just went over her house one night. We just had a movie night. You know, we're watching the mandalorian on Disney plus. So we all stayed at the house. There's extra bedrooms, so me and my friend passed on the couch. And then everybody went to bed. And even her brother and his wife and their little boy went to bed, you know, and they had a separate room. And I'm sitting there on the couch and my buddy's passed out. And next thing you know, I hear little kid voices and footsteps running past the couch. And I'm like, her nephew is asleep. And I started hearing little kid voices and laughing and giggling. Honestly, I thought I heard a playground. And I'm like, well, you're just losing your mind Because I live right across the street from a school. It's just kids, you know, I'm just like, whatever. But then I open my eyes, I realize it's 2:30 in the morning and that's all I heard. And these footsteps going back and forth and it's like little feet. Yeah, you know, I was just really freaked out. So next morning I get up, I tell my friend, she's like, you bring it. You're just crazy. And I turn to my friend that's next to me, you know, the next day, I'm like, hey, what's crazy is our kid voice in little footsteps. And he looks at me dead serious. He goes, well, I didn't want to sound crazy, but I know what you were talking about. I heard it. I heard the little footsteps and the kids playing outside like it was a playground. And he goes, when I woke up, it was 2:45. And he goes, I was watching you watch that. And I was just pretending I was sleeping. I go, I'm not crazy. I'm like. He goes, no. I was like, all right, whatever. So a week goes by. We do it again. My friend doesn't show up until a little bit later that night because he's kind of freaked out. He's like, well, I don't want to go over there. So we do the same thing again. Everybody goes upstairs. E guy actually goes upstairs in the extra spare bedroom. So I'm sitting there on the couch. I sit here, guys talk in the house and I go, hello. And they're talking, freaking out, there's no one there. Next, you know, I hear dishes, stuff moving in the kitchen. And the light starts flickering and I look, I'm like, lots of cats, you know, you're losing your mind. I look over, all three cats were in the tree just looking at me, like walking to our world. I'm like, what? No way. You know, I mean, so like craft of courage. And I go to the kitchen, the light's flickering, so once I get up, the light stays on. There's a dinner table in there with eight chairs. We pushed the chairs in, the chairs had moved away, they were all facing the wall, they're all spread out and everything stopped. I went, oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no. So I backed out of the kitchen and I started praying and I turned off the light and I'm like, you're losing your mind. An hour later, her sister in law got up to go to work at 4:30 and it stopped at 4:15. And I realized what I just witnessed. But I've heard of little kid voices and stuff like that, but just had to share it with you.

My friend lives over here in the town we live on on the south end of town and just went over her house one night. We just had a movie night. You know, we're watching the Mandalorian on Disney plus. So we all stayed at the house. There's extra bedrooms so me and my friend passed on the couch and then everybody went to bed and even her brother and his wife and their little boy went to bed. You know, they had a separate room and I'm sitting there on the couch and my buddy's passed out and next thing you know I hear little kid voices and footsteps running past the couch and I'm like her nephew is asleep. And I start hearing little kid voices and laughing and giggling. And honestly, I thought I heard a playground. And I'm like, well, you're just losing your mind because I live right across the street from the school. It's just kids, you know, I'm just like, whatever. But then I open my eyes, I realize it's 2:30 in the morning and that's all I heard. And these footsteps going back and forth and it's like little feet. Yeah, you know, I was just really freaked out. So next morning we get up, I tell my friend, she's like, you bring it. You're just crazy. And I turn to my friend that's next to me, you know, the next day I'm like, hey, what's crazy is our kids voice in little footsteps. And he looks at me dead serious. He goes, well, I didn't want to sound crazy, but I know what you were talking about. I heard it. I heard the little footsteps and the kids playing outside like it was a playground. And he goes, when I woke up, it was 2:45. And he goes, I was watching you watch that and I was just pretending I was sleeping. I go, I'm not crazy. I'm like. He goes, no. I was like, all right, whatever. So a week goes by, we do it again. My friend doesn't show up until a little bit later that night because he's kind of freaked out. He's like, well, I don't know if I want to go over there. So we do the same thing again. Everybody goes upstairs. Ego actually goes to sleep in the extra spare bedroom. So I'm sitting there on the couch. I sit here. Guys talk in the house. And I go, hello. And they're talking, freaking out. There's no one there. Next, you know, I hear dishes, stuff moving in the kitchen. And the light starts flickering. And I look, I'm like, lots of cats. You know, you're losing your mind. I look over, all three cats were in the tree just looking at me, like, walking to our world. I'm like, what? No way. You know, I mean, so like craft of courage. And I go to the kitchen, the light's flickering. So once I get up, the light stays on. There's a dinner table in there with eight chairs. We pushed the chairs in, the chairs had moved away. They were all facing the wall. They were all spread out and everything stopped. I went, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. So I backed out of the kitchen and I started praying and I turned off the light and I'M like you're losing your mind. An hour later, her sister in law got up to go to work at 4:30 and it stopped at 4:15 and I realized what I just witnessed. But I've heard of little kid voices and stuff like that, but just had to share it with you.

A few years ago I went down to Ottumwa, Iowa, which is southeastern Iowa, to spend a weekend at my in law's house and we were using their primary bathroom, my wife and I, and to get into the primary bedroom and the bathroom from the hallway. There's a room before those rooms. It's like a powder room that has the closets. It's a somewhat older house for Iowa. It's probably 100 years old. It's a long house. So this is one end of the house that the primary bedroom sits on top of. And so like the kitchen is at the exact opposite end of the house. My sister in law was out of the house. I believe my father in law was down at his work. I believe my mother in law was in the kitchen at the opposite end of the house. I think my wife had gone to take a nap, but she had just used the bathroom in the primary bedroom before me. And I closed the door from the hallway into the powder room and then the door to the bathroom and she had just finished and I was in there showering and it wasn't very long in the shower. And I remember ending the shower and hearing what I thought was someone trying to talk to me from the other side of the door. And again, this is A very long house. And she was downstairs kind of towards the middle part of the house. And pretty sure my mother in law was at the opposite end of the kitchen. And I thought it might have been my wife who had forgotten something. And so I think I remember saying something like, hold on one second. And I heard a little bit more of like a murmur talk. It was muffled. And as I went to reach for the bathroom door, there was this big bang on the other side of the door. And I thought maybe she was frustrated and I didn't get to the door quick enough or something had happened or she bumped into it. And it was almost like an angry hit with a fist or your foot. And I remember trying to throw the towel on really quick and open up the door to look. And I opened up the bathroom door and there was nobody in the powder room. And the door from the powder room to the hallway was still closed. And I remember shutting the bathroom door, getting dressed, and then going to the hallway just a few minutes later to see if there was anybody upstairs or if something had happened. Nobody was upstairs. I remember going downstairs thinking, did somebody come in through the front door? Nobody had come home. So this was an unexplainable event. And I remember explaining it to my in laws and they didn't like to hear about it. There's been other kind of questionable things at their house that has happened, but we're trying to be logic about it and explain it away. But this was one that I tried to be logic about it, but there is kind of an unexplainable. If nobody was in the area, what was it that I heard and who hit the door? Again, it could have been something from outside, could have been a door closing somewhere, but nobody was closing anything. And again, the kitchen is way at the other end and there's no doors to close in the kitchen. So just thought I'd share this, but I love your podcast. Keep it up.

I lived with my family in Nashville before we moved out here to Rock island. And this is where this story takes place. So I've just had my fourth baby and I am just doing dishes or doing something, you know, got four kids. So. Phone rings and I'm talking to my mother in law. I had just had my youngest one and she's calling, you know, checking up on me, hey, how's the baby? As our conversation ends. Then I said, oh, nanny, he's doing good. He's sleeping right now. And we hang up. After I hang up, I hear a little voice saying, go check on him. And I'm thinking, well, little voice, he's such a light sleeper. I'll wake him up. I'm arguing with the voice, right, okay. So I hear again, go check on him. I'm like, okay, I'm gonna go check on him. I'm checking on him. And I go in and my baby is blue. So I squeegee him out.

So it was July or August, so I was sleeping with my window open. My apartment backs up to an alley that runs throughout the houses of my street. A lot of driveways back there. People take their trash out back there, things of that nature. So laying there asleep, I have to get up for work pretty soon. So my alarm's about to go off, but something jolted me up about 15 minutes before. My alarm is set for. My headboard is right next to the window at this point. So just laying there, complete silence. And then all of a sudden, something says something. And the best way to describe it, it's kind of hard to describe, is it was the scream. But it started off, almost sounded like normal talking. And then it kind of progressed into this deep kind of growl slash scream. And it sounded like he was definitely coming from the alley in the back of my apartment. And what it sounded like was someone was, you know, at first kind of calling for like a pet to come inside. Should imagine someone let their dog outside, they're calling their pet's name to come back inside. But then as the sentence kind of went on, I kind of progressed into, like I said, this deep kind of growl scream. And it was really bizarre because right after this happened, just complete silence, really. No other noises after I heard this weird scream, talking. I think if it was, you know, someone taking out their pet or calling to get their pet inside, you'd hear some other noise after, whether it's the dog moving around or doors opening and closing, but just complete silence after this. So not really sure what to think of it. Haven't heard anything since that's similar. But, you know, I do want to say that sometimes there's homeless people that kind of travel throughout the alleys in our neighborhood. So it could have been, you know, someone walking through the alley early in the morning, and maybe they were just upset about something. But it didn't really sound like something that, you know, a human really could be making it. To be honest with you, it was pretty deep. And like I said, it sounded like it was really coming from the gut. Pretty creepy. Not sure exactly what could have caused it, but thought it was kind of cool with the recent knockman sightings we've had here. So I love the podcast. Looking forward to the next episode.

I've been listening to your show for a couple of weeks now, and it's really triggering some memories that I've had. But today I just wanted to tell you about one in particular that really stuck out to me. So this happened in Salt Lake City, and It was about 12 years ago, maybe. I was staying with a friend of mine. I was there in Salt Lake for a convention, and he didn't have a spare bedroom, so I was sleeping in the basement on the couch. And I've always had kind of an aversion to basements because in the house that I grew up in, I always felt like I was being watched. Like my entire life always felt uncomfortable in the basement. And I kind of felt this way in this basement, too, but I didn't really think anything of it. But when I was sleeping on the couch, I was kind of in a fetal position, and my body was turned towards the stairs, so I was facing away from the couch cushions. So in the middle of the night, I'm guessing it was probably somewhere between two and four. It was very quiet. And something woke me up. And so I kind of came to and I started hearing this shuffling. It was clearly footsteps shuffling on the carpet. And I knew it wasn't my friend because I just. My whole body, you know, when you get into those situations when you're around weird energy and like everything in my body just started to kind of prick. My solar plexus started going crazy and I was just like, oh my goodness. But the kicker is that it said, follow me, wake up. And I just kind of curled into myself and said, nope. Said it in my mind. And I rolled over and kind of like scooted over towards the cushions. I didn't hear anything walk away. Nothing else happened. I went back to sleep. So the next morning, my friend came downstairs to check on me and I asked him, I said, hey, do your girls whose bedrooms were in the basement? I said, have they ever said that they felt uncomfortable or anything? And his face turned white and he was like, yes, they don't like coming down here. What happened? And I told him and he was just like, oh my gosh. But here's the crazy thing is it was his voice that said that to me. And I've heard things about like, trickery, that sort of thing, like demons, like showing up as little kids, that kind of stuff. I mean, I didn't sense that it was a demon, but I don't know. I mean, it was asking me to follow it and I definitely did not have plans to do so. So I thought that was just kind of an interesting story that I wanted to share with you. And I love your show.

So it's important to note that before this story takes place, I had just visited Goatman's Bridge in Denton, Texas, with my mom, because we're both super into that kind of thing. And we actually ended up meeting up with some group that had been formed on, like, the nextdoor app of moms that liked Paranormal stuff and they were super cool and my mom loved hanging out with them and we ended up doing like a TikTok investigation where they live streamed it and had a really great time doing that. So we eventually left because I honestly got a little weirded out by the whole thing at a certain point, point I didn't have a good feeling. So we ended up leaving after a while. Also another strange thing to note is that following that experience for maybe two weeks or so, I would be like ordering food just at various places and it would always be like, oh, I would be customer number 666 or my total would come out to be $6.66. This happened at least four or five times in like a two week span at different restaurants. So anyways, onto the story. This story takes place about a week later. I just recently graduated with my bachelor's degree and I'm currently working as a vet tech waiting on the results of my applications to different vet schools. So I work right now at a super small clinic with just one doctor and four staff members, including myself. So a couple weeks ago we were closing up the clinic for the day and I was the first one walking out the back door. My co worker was holding the door open to the alley where we park our cars and I was facing that same alleyway. I was just looking forward and I heard a very, very clear, hushed Bella from behind me. So I turn around, look at my co workers and all of them are looking back at me confused. And I stood there for a second, just said, what? And they all started laughing, asking if I was okay. And I replied, just saying like, okay, well one of you said my name. But they were all just sitting there quiet and confused and they just said none of them had said anything at all. So we laughed it off. And I just assumed that I was exhausted and I just needed some rest. Quick side note, by this point in my job, I had been driving myself absolutely insane, seeing things out of the corner of my eyes. But I chalked it up to just being surrounded by death all the time with all the euthanasias and just being freaked out about it. So the next day at work, it was a pretty slow part of the day and I was filling a prescription for one of our patients. At this point, we had nobody in the building except for myself, two co workers and my boss, who's extremely quiet and reserved. So once again I heard an extremely clear, more clear than the day before, hushed Bella from behind me. So I was like, okay, somebody's trying to get my attention. So I was gonna finish filling the prescription, so I didn't lose track of what I was doing. I, you know, turned the corner and replied, you know, what's up? And they looked at me and just said, nothing. And once again, I was like, okay, well, which one of you needed something? And they both replied, we don't need anything. Like, what's up? And I was just like, okay, well, one of you needed something from me. And they just said, no. We've been completely silent this whole time. So I was getting frustrated at this point. And I was like, if y' all are messing with me, I need to know now, or I'm gonna go check myself into a ward. But they swore up and down that they weren't messing with me. And I've asked a million times, and I believe them that they were not. So also important to note that I have awful hearing. And in retrospect, if they had even said my name in a normal tone of voice from that distance, I would.\n\n[Speaker D] Not have heard it.\n\n[Speaker B] My hearing is bad, but it's also selective. And 99% of the time, when somebody's talking to me, like, directly to me, right next to me, I don't even hear it. So, same day, I was on my lunch break, went to Target to shop for birthday presents for my boyfriend, who I was gonna go visit the following week. And I was walking down an aisle that was along the backside of the store, which had, like, smaller aisles perpendicular to it. And on the left side, where that shelving unit was, on the very bottom shelf, there was a bunch of spools of Christmas lights and not a single person in the aisle. Nothing was moving in the aisles that connected to it. No shaking of the floor or anything. One of the spools of Christmas lights falls off the shelf, rolls across the aisle, and lands and stops directly in front of my feet, like a foot, even if that. And just sits there. And I was just like, okay, I guess this is how my day's going. I looked around. Nobody was there. The shelf wasn't moving. Nothing else in the entire shelf moved, shifted, shaked, fell, anything. So I tell my co workers about it, and they just kind of laugh it off, and they just think I'm crazy. So I told my mom about everything after the whole day ended, and I'm not very religious, but she was just like, oh, I'll pray for you. And like, this is awful. And I was just like, this is more inconvenient for me at this point point than anything. Like, I was just getting irritated, but she was genuinely concerned. And I was just like, well, I appreciate your concern. And she's like, you need to pray, too. And I'm like, okay, whatever is going to help you sleep at night, I guess. But yeah, I mean, after that, not a single thing has happened since. I still see things out of the corner of my eye every once in a while, but it could very well just be my eyesight being bad or my hair or. Or being tired, I don't know. But I really enjoy the show and I hope that you can use this.

I got a strange one for you. Not really explainable and I'm not quite sure how to classify it. It was probably 2019, August or September. I was working a sunrise shift. So I would wake up at 3am to get ready for work and to set it up. I would walk out of my bedroom and I would turn right down a hallway and go straight to my kitchen. My kitchen has one window on the left and one window straight ahead. So I wake up like usual, three in the morning. I walk into my kitchen. All my lights are off and this bright white light, like I'm talking, it felt like someone was holding a flashlight up to my face. How bright it was moves from below up through my windows. Both the one to my left and the one straight ahead lit up like my entire kitchen area. And I could never quite explain it because the window to My left faces directly to my neighbor and the one straight ahead, it's got a horizontal street going across and then there's a church. So there's no car coming in any direction. There's no way that someone's high beams are coming through my window somehow. The one thing I recently thought it could have been was maybe a spotlight from a helicopter. But I didn't hear a helicopter. I didn't hear anything. And I'm sure if it was a helicopter with a spotlight, there would have been something in the news about looking for somebody or something or other. Right after this happened, I flicked on my lights. I was kind of shocked because, you know, had a bright light that felt like it was shined directly into my eyes. Looked out my window and you know, streets are pretty empty around three in the morning. Of course my neighbors weren't awake obviously and definitely not shining lights. This was on kind of an elevated floor, second floor anyway. So there's no way that anyone could have shown a light through my window. Just something I couldn't quite explain. Never have been able to really think of a proper explanation. It didn't help that that same night I was having very strange dreams involving aliens and stuff. I'm not suggesting any abductions or that it was aliens, but it was a strange set of dreams followed by a strange circumstance. There was no way for me to even confirm anything about being abducted. I usually sleep in the nude, so I couldn't check if my pajamas were on backwards or something. Anyways, just a really strange occurrence. Never been able to explain it and it's always kind of stuck in the back of my head and just something I always remember.

This experience happened in the early to mid-90s. I was probably, you know, around 11 or 12. My brother had recently moved down to southern Utah and gotten married so my brothers drove us down to visit him and he was living in an older one bedroom apartment complex on the second floor. So at night my parents got the couches to sleep on and I got to sleep on the living room floor. Well, the place I was sleeping looked straight through the living room down the hall towards the bathroom and bedroom. The little kitchen in this place was just off to the right before the hallway. So it was pretty late at night, maybe 12 1am and I just couldn't sleep because of the heat. I believe this was late July, probably close to 100 degrees outside and the ceiling fan was almost directly above me. It just wasn't helping out. So there I was just listening to my Walkman cassette player when movement in the hallway just caught my eye. It looked like my brother was coming down the hallway but you know, it didn't look like him at the same time. It was just different. He looked almost transparent like and he seemed to be coming directly at me without moving. Wasn't until he got closer. I looked up and saw his head seemingly go right through the fan blades without affecting them or him. He wasn't that tall so I was confused and looked down to see him floating close to almost a foot off the ground. When I looked back up, he was straight above me. He looked right at me, put his pointer finger to his lips in kind of a shushing gesture, and then floated to the kitchen, to the main door, and then disappeared through it. You know, I don't think I moved the rest of the night. I just lay there, scared and confused. I never saw my brother come back in, if, you know, that was my brother. But when morning finally did arrive, his bedroom door opened. I just stared at him, not even responding to him when he said, good morning. He looks fully normal now. And I was hoping he'd make a comment about whatever happened the night before, but he never did. He just behaved like nothing ever happened. Well, I never told anybody this story because, honestly, it confused the hell out of me and couldn't explain it. So it wasn't until I got some of your episodes about the living hauntings and astral projection that it hit me that Esma explained what I saw those years ago. Thank you so much for the podcast, Eric.

The story has to do with a group of us that went out to a country road. And I was in the passenger seat of the car my friend Greg was driving. We were both looking at each other talking about stuff. There was two guys in the back of the car, one guy, his head down, the other guy was looking kind of forward. This is about 10:30 at night in the summer and right in the front of the car, the brightest light that we've ever seen. It was unexplainable. It was kind of a whity green, but it was really bright and it seemed to last for probably about six to seven seconds and then it just vanished. And we were all super confused of what was going on. We looked around, turned the lights on in the car to look at each other and she was like, what the heck was that? And Greg's left side of his face because he was the driver, his left side of his face was completely red. The other side of his face was white. We're Caucasian. And my right side of my face was red and the left side of my face was white. And the guy that had his head down, he was completely same color as he was previous. And the guy that was looking forward, his entire face was red. And it seemed to be a time lapse thing too because looked like it was 11:35 when we kind of were like, what the hell is going on? And what we're like, we got to get the out of here. Sorry about the language. And we started driving and everything seemed to be going really slow but fast at the same time. And it looked like we were going to run into the back of some sort of vehicle. And my buddy slammed on the brakes and this vehicle just appeared out of nowhere and then it just disappeared. And there was just a pop can blowing down this country road in the middle of the road like, what the heck is going on? And I looked out to the right side of the vehicle in the field. I swore I could see these probably about 4 foot tall darker beings they were because they were in the grass through the Tree line. But they were walking around this field. I just yelled out, like, get out of here. Let's go, let's go, let's go. And we got out of there, and we stopped in town, and we were like, I don't know what just happened, but we can't tell anybody about that because that was completely weird. And Greg's mom, she owned a New Age store, and there was a lot of spiritual people in the store. Anyway, it was about a week later we went to Greg's house. He lived down in the city with his mom. We knocked on the door, and his mom, Carol, answered the door, and she looked at me, and she just smiled this huge smile. She was an amazing woman. She's passed on now. She passed away from cancer, but she was very intuitive. And she just looked at me and she's like, huh, You've been touched by the light. That's special. And she turned around and walked away. And two minutes later, Greg came to the door. And we're like, dude, did you tell your mom about that stuff? And he's like, no, I haven't told anybody about it. And so I'm like, she just came up to me and said that I was touched by the light. And this happened when we were in our 20s and I'm now 51. I just texted him today and reiterated that evening to him. And he was like, yeah, maybe that comet is the reason why our faces turned red and the little people are the ones that touched us. And that sort of blows me away. Anyway, that area of that country road had government signs of do not trespass, don't access. And they were actual government signs that have been put up same time period. Anyway, that's my story. Thanks for listening, and hopefully this makes it on your show.

I was just watching a pretty popular TikTok account where they tell scary stories.\n\n[Speaker E] And.\n\n[Speaker D] And this girl was saying a story from South Texas, talking about a large bird, possibly even a pterodactyl, but it was, like, human like that they saw in their barn. They didn't say what city, but they said south Texas. And it reminded me that I have this memory from when I was young. This would have been in the early 90s, so there was no Internet back then. But I have this memory that I was watching the news with my parents, and there was this, like, huge bird that was the size of a man, and it looked like a man. Like, the body and everything looked 100 like a man, but it had feathers and everything, like a bird. And it had a face of, like a bird. And so it was a bird, but also looked like a man. I want to say it was either at the flea market or downtown, you know, an area that's very populated. And I want to say that there was even a photo of this thing that was either on the news or in the newspaper. And they were just saying that they had no idea what it was. And I want to even say this man bird thing, like a bluish color. But I had that memory. And whenever I've asked my parents about it, they have no idea what I'm talking about. And whenever I Google it, I don't find anything about that. But I've, you know, just given up on that and thought, well, maybe it was just like a dream, but I don't know why it's like a strong memory if it's just a dream. I mean, we are on the border of Mexico and there's, you know, the legend of the lechrusas, the witches that turn into the owl, but this is not an owl. Didn't look like an owl at all. It did also remind me of you. Not long ago played a story and I want to say south Texas, but they didn't specify where exactly. And they said that they saw this huge bird that looks like an owl. I want to say they said it even had like an owl face, but the body of a woman and that the woman looked like she was wearing like the scuba outfit or whatever, the neoprene, you know, but white. I thought that was interesting. Who knows, maybe somebody has a story similar or same memory. Maybe it wasn't a memory.

I'm calling you from the Detroit, Michigan area. So I just listened to an episode where a caller was talking about her and her husband. I think hearing Native American flute music while her friend and her husband didn't. It reminded me of My story so I'm a professional musician and I teach music lessons as well. So one day I go to the place where I teach music lessons. I'm upstairs and it's very early, so I'm the only one there besides the guy who ran the place. And I could hear a violin playing. So obviously it's not that shocking to hear a violin playing in a music lesson studio, but we didn't have a violin teacher at the time. So I walked around to every room. There was nobody there but the guy who ran the place. I walked into his office, I asked him if he heard the violin, and he looked at me with a horrified look on his face and said, yeah, do you hear it too? So we looked in every studio. We couldn't find it. There was a bar downstairs from us which was like an R and B hip hop bar, but they weren't open. But we walked down there anyway. The doors were closed, There was nobody inside. There were no cars in the parking lot. So to this day, I have no idea where this violin music was coming from. The radio was not on in the music studio. The guy that was in the office was just sitting there doing work on his computer. There was no radio on, there were no windows open. We were kind of set off the road pretty far back off the road, actually. So even if somebody had music playing in their car with their windows down, we wouldn't hear where we were. I've never been that frightened in my life because that music wasn't coming from anywhere, but we both heard it perfectly clear. So that's my story. Love the podcast. Keep it spooky.

This one is like short and sweet. I was living in a house close to the Houston area and there was a bunch of energy there that was unexplainable just because I experienced most of the things in my life from there. First time I had sleep paralysis, reoccurring dreams, things of that sort. But anyway, I was getting ready for work or something and I was standing in front of my vanity and doing my makeup and I had this pickle jar full of change, just that you accumulate over time. So it was like a big pickle jar and it was sitting on my mini fridge on the ground and the pickle jar was towards the back of the fridge. Anyway, I'm just listening to music, getting ready and it just goes flying off of my fridge fridge and falls on the floor and there's no way it could have fallen. It wasn't unstable and it wasn't on the edge and there's nobody else in the room and nothing going on and it didn't break was the other thing. It fell on carpet. And I didn't feel afraid or scared or like, creeped out. I was just like, how in the world did that happen?

When I was younger, I I guess I was about six or seven years old. My parents, they had some friends over. It was like a party atmosphere. We were all downstairs. I guess I was just getting a little rambunctious or getting on their nerves. So they told me it was time for me to go to bed and I didn't want to go to sleep. I wanted to stay down with all of the adults and, you know, be nosy and be a kid. But they said no, it's time for bed. So they sent me upstairs and I started throwing a little tantrum. I was crying and didn't want to go to sleep. So they told me, stay in my room. So I went in my room, and I was in there crying, crying, crying. While I was crying, I noticed, like, in the corner of my room, there's this chair. And I looked at the chair, and there was just this black, dark figure. And it was, like, staticky. Like the static kind of you would see on a television. It was just growing and getting bigger and coming up over this chair. And because I was crying and had tears in my eyes, I thought, oh, maybe I'm just seeing things. So I went and rubbed my eyes clear and rubbed them really good and blinked and then looked again, and it was coming over the chair. Like, now it was over the chair and crawling up toward me on the bed. Like, toward the bed. It just kept getting bigger and moving forward, and I just couldn't believe it. I freaked out. So I just got under my covers and I looked one more time, and it was still moving toward me. This big figure, like, all dark, black, staticky, moving. And so I just pulled the covers up and stopped crying and just stayed under my covers all night. I didn't move or wake up until the next morning. My mom had to come in and wake me up, and I was, like, drenched because I just stayed in that position. I don't know if I told my mom or not, but in my head, I thought that that was the sandman, because, you know, I'd always heard the saying, if you don't go to sleep, the sandman is going to come and get you. You know, put sand in your eyes and make you go to sleep if you don't go to bed. And I never saw it again. But now that I've been listening to this podcast and I hear about the shadow people, I'm thinking I probably saw a shadow person, but I didn't have anything to compare it to. And, you know, I don't think I imagined it because, like I said, I cleared my eyes, like, because at first I was like, hold on. You know when you're crying and you see everything blurry? I was like, let me clear. So I rubbed my eyes really good and blinked and everything, and it was still there. And then I looked for another time, like, peeked again through my cover, still there. So, yeah, I think I saw a shadow person, but that's my story. So.

I've been listening to a lot of people talk about the Shadow man and I decided to tell my story. Now this happened in 2019 or 2020, give or take, because me and my wife were dating around that time. Now we were hanging out that night and I had to go to work the next morning. So she went home and I went to bed. And at this time I had a tendency to watch and listen to TV before going to bed or in order to fall asleep. And I was watching one of my comfort shows. So I know what happens and what's going to happen, which that kind of plays a role in this story. And I'm listening to it, watching it, and I must have dozed off and then while I was asleep I heard someone talking outside. So I woke up and I have this thing to when I wake up, like my brain won't let me go back to sleep until I check the front doors to make sure they're locked. I got up, I went to the front door, I locked both locks and I double checked. I locked both locks and I went back in my room. Something told me to lock my room door. I have no idea why, I've never done this, but I locked my room door also. I don't know why. And I went back and I laid back down and I started watching TV until I dozed off. And I'm watching TV and I hear my front door doorknob twist. And I was like, no, that's impossible. I locked both locks and the door opened. And at this point I'm just like, no, this can't be real. My mind is playing tricks on me. You know, scary movie philosophy. I ignored it because I think my mind is playing tricks on me. I continue to watch my show and I'm laying down and all of a sudden I cannot move. I physically cannot move. I can only see, hear and blink at this point. And my TV is still on. I can hear it, I can see it. And the show is going in chronological order the way it's supposed to. And then all of a sudden my room door is just open. And I'm thinking, no, it's impossible. I locked my room door. I know for sure that I locked my room door. And my room door opens. And all of a sudden this big, tall, darker than dark. My room is dark, but you can still see the outline form of this figure. It was maybe six and a half feet tall and it walked in my room. At this point, my heart just starts jumping, like rapidly, just beeping fast. And this figure walked in front of my tv and as it walked in front of my tv, my tv, I'm not able to see it anymore. So, meaning, like this figure is solid because I can't see my tv, but I can still hear it. And then it walked around my bed and it walked to where I was sleeping. And I still cannot move at this point. And this figure like hovers above me, like standing next to me, looking down at me while I'm just laying there. And I'm not able to move. And this figure is above me and it leans down and it puts its face so close to my face that I can make out it's facial form. It's a face with no features. That's the best I can describe it. And all of a sudden I just shot up and I looked around, I had a tear in my eye and my TV is still playing in the sequence it's supposed to be playing in. And all this happened in the form of maybe 35 seconds, 45 seconds, give or take maybe even a minute. Because I know the show I was watching, I know what happened. And I just looked around, I shot out of my bed, I went to my front door, my front door was locked and I came back in my room. And at this point I'm just too scared to go to sleep. But yeah, that's my story. Thanks for listening and I love everything you do. I listen to your podcast Going to work.

So I had a weird thing happen to me while running at night. I often run around midnight, and then I'll go to bed. For some reason, it helps me sleep. But this one night, I was running and I ran up a cul de sac and ran back down. And my neighborhood has uniform mailboxes. They're all brick and they all have a light pole in them. For some reason, I'm fixated on this light pole to my left, this mailbox to my left. And as I'm looking at it, smoke emanates from it. And my first thought is a fuse blew out or something. And as the smoke rises, it takes the form of a miniature body. Now, this body didn't have arms or torso, just legs, like something that's about a foot tall, walking in the air from right to left, right in front of my path, and then disappeared. It was one of the weirdest things I've seen. I've seen some paranormal things in my time, but I've never heard of some really small, almost like a child, and walking like a man, upright in air and then disappearing. Hope you like it.

I'm so sorry to call you from.\n\n[Speaker E] My truck, but I think I'm looking.\n\n[Speaker D] At a UFO right now.\n\n[Speaker E] It is 6:50 in the morning and I'm going south on I5. I travel from Bellingham down to Seattle and I am here. Exit. Oh man, I don't know, but there's this like giant star in front of me and I was looking at it and there's another one slightly down to the left of it. And I thought, oh, it's two planets, I wonder which ones they are. And then the lower left one, it just like faded out and then completely disappeared. I'm like, oh, weird because it was so bright.\n\n[Speaker D] But now it came back and it's like all flickery and kind of moves up next to the. I think it's a planet. I want to say it's Venus. Yeah, as I'm taking this little turn.\n\n[Speaker E] I'm realizing that is the east over there and that's where Venus is.\n\n[Speaker D] I don't know if there's another planet aligned with it, but the lower it.\n\n[Speaker E] Just keeps disappearing and reappearing and it's not too cloudy right now.

This happened in Westover, Vermont, at a restaurant that I used to work at called the Last Chair. So basically, this place does have history. It is haunted. The paranormal investigators of New England have come out and investigated it. I got to investigate it with them as well. There's nothing, you know, malevolent or anything there, but there's definitely some things there. So my story is I was working one evening, and at the time, we had this area kind of by these stairs that was kind of in the middle of the restaurant. There was an unopened part of just a restaurant that we have that's kind of on the other side of the stairs. Anyways, these stairs give everyone an eerie feeling, including me, including the investigators. But anyways, at that time, we had our backup kind of supplies there. And so I went over because I had to grab some backup, like, kitty cups. And during that time, I didn't have an eerie feeling at all when I went over there. Usually I feel like someone is standing on the stairwell watching me. However, this time, nothing like that. Now, we weren't allowed to be on our phone, but I'm like, I'm stepping away. We're not busy. I wanted to check my phone. So I was about to pull it out of my apron, and then all of a sudden, I heard a whistle. It was my boss's whistle. And so I didn't take my phone out because I'm like, okay, well, he's there. I'm not going to take my phone out. And then I don't see him. So then I'm like, well, that's kind of weird, but okay, I'm going to walk over. And I bet you anything he's not in the kitchen right now, because that night he was working in the kitchen doing expo on the line. And so I thought for sure there was no way he was going to be in the kitchen. I walk over, he is standing in the kitchen. So I go in and I say, hey, were you just next door or, you know, upstairs? There is an upstairs, like, loft area. Even though I knew there was no way he could have gotten from that part of the restaurant back over to the kitchen without me seeing him. And he said, no, I've been in here. And I said, well, is anyone else supposed to be over there? He's like, no. So we go over. There is no one in the lower part, the other side of the restaurant. There is no one upstairs. And actually, as a matter of fact, as soon as we went upstairs, the hair on the back of his arm stood up and he had goosebumps. And I did see that. So that was something kind of crazy that happened. It reminds me of, like, a mimic, because it sounded just like his whistle enough for me to not take my phone out because I thought he was, you know, in the vicinity right there.
